            <h2>4 This Puzzles Me</h2>
            <p>Why do people hate AI? Why do they feel real disgust or fear about AI? I don't. I never have. I can't explain it. I can't explain other people's reactions and I can't explain mine. It puzzles me in a really deep way. 
            <p>Here's a memory from grad school about computers and C++ and poetry. Maybe it gets at something helpful.</p>                
            <p>C++ is a programming language. People still use it for lots of things. It has a reputation for being hard to learn and hard to use. Back in 1997 I was working on my MFA in poetry at the University of Arkansas. C++ was the language for stuff other than HTML for websites. I was fascinated by C++ because of its look on the "page." Here's a random example:</p>

<pre><code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

void first_stanza() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "I have eaten\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "the plums\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "that were in\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "the icebox\n\n";
}

void second_stanza() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "and which\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "you were probably\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "saving\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "for breakfast\n\n";
}

void third_stanza() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Forgive me\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "they were delicious\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "so sweet\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "and so cold\n";
}

int main() {
    first_stanza();
    second_stanza();
    third_stanza();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>            

<p>Here's something else. This is from a book by Hannah Weiner (1982) called <em>Code Poems</em>. "Code" here doesn't mean computer code. Weiner made her poems using the International Code of Signals, the language used by ships to communicate. Each three-letter signal is a command or a "function." Each one returns a specific phrase.</p>
<p>Here's a link to Weiner talking about her <a href="https://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/weiner/0-9.html">poetics.</a></p>
<p>This is from the book:</p>
<pre><code>
CHW   Pirates

CJD   I was plundered by a pirate
CJF   Describe the pirate
CJN   She is armed
CJP   How is she armed?
CJS   She has long guns
CJW   I have no long guns
BLD   I am a complete wreck
</code></pre>
            
<p>I loved this kind of stuff. I was trying to get better at poetry and learning C++ at the same time. I felt no contradiction in that. (Some of my professors did.) Code and poetry are compressions of language. The letters and symbols in poetry and code do something different from ordinary speech.</p>
<p>That's just one example of computers and poetry. Computers (to me) are more like strange or distant neighbors to poetry, not enemies.</p>
