            <h2>4 Something that puzzles me</h2>
            <p>I believe people when they say they hate AI or feel automatic disgust or fear when they see anything to do with AI. I don't. I never have. It's something I can't explain. There are a lot of things about AI conversations I'm puzzled about. There will be time to write about them. For now, I've got one quick memory about computers that goes back to grad school and c++.</p>
            <p>C++ is a programming language. People still use it for lots of things. It has a reputation for being hard to learn and use. Back in 1997 when I was working on my MFA in poetry at the University of Arkansas, c++ was the language someone learned for stuff other than HTML for websites. I was fascinated by c++ because of how it looked on the "page." Here's a random example:</p>

<pre><code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

void first_stanza() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "I have eaten\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "the plums\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "that were in\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "the icebox\n\n";
}

void second_stanza() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "and which\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "you were probably\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "saving\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "for breakfast\n\n";
}

void third_stanza() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Forgive me\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "they were delicious\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "so sweet\n";
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "and so cold\n";
}

int main() {
    first_stanza();
    second_stanza();
    third_stanza();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>            

<p>Here's something else. This is from a book by Hannah Weiner (1982) called <em>Code Poems</em>. "Code" here doesn't mean computer code. Weiner made her poems using the International Code of Signals, the language used by ships to communicate. Each three-letter signal is a command or a "function" that returns a specific phrase.</p>
<p>Here's a link to Weiner talking about her <a href="https://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/weiner/0-9.html">poetics.</a></p>
<p>This is from the book:</p>
<pre><code>
CHW   Pirates

CJD   I was plundered by a pirate
CJF   Describe the pirate
CJN   She is armed
CJP   How is she armed?
CJS   She has long guns
CJW   I have no long guns
BLD   I am a complete wreck
</code></pre>
            
<p>I loved this kind of stuff when I was trying to get better at poetry and learning c++ at the same time. Code and poetry are compressions of language, letters and symbols that do something different than ordinary speech.</p>
<p>That's just one example of why computers (to me) seem more like strange or distant neighbors to poetry and not enemies.</p>
