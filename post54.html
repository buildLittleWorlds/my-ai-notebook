  <h2>54 The Author-Function as Sacrilege: A Romantic Test</h2>
  <p>The most common critique of AI writing is that there is "no one there." This assumes the Romantic ideal of an "author" as a soul pouring its meaning into the text. But the rigorous Romantics started from a more skeptical place: Schleiermacher famously argued that <strong>misunderstanding is the norm</strong>, and therefore interpretation must be a disciplined art.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> A core part of that art was reconstructing the author's singular practice.</p>
  <p>This wasn't just empathy; it was a formal method. It involved both a <strong>comparative</strong> analysis (tracing patterns against the rules of language) and a <strong>"divinatory"</strong> one, making a disciplined, intuitive leap to hypothesize the creative act that could produce such a text. So, let's run this more complex test. What happens when a Romantic interpreter confronts an AI?</p>

  <h3>A Practical Demonstration</h3>
  <p>I prompted an AI: "Write a four-line poem about a city at night."</p>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1rem;">
    <p>The velvet dark doth cloak the stone,<br>Where steel and glass in slumber lie,<br>A million lights, like seeds are sown,<br>Beneath a silent, watching sky.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Applying the method:</p>
  
  <h4>1. The Grammatical/Comparative Rail (if the word "rail" confuses you here, head over <a href="romantic-kit-hermeneutics.html">here</a>)</h4>
  <p>The poem uses shared conventions: quatrain, iambic-ish meter, ABCB rhyme, familiar tropes. This is the baseline evidence, the public system of language.</p>

  <h4>2. The Psychological/Divinatory Rail</h4>
  <p>Now we must make our leap. We must, as Schleiermacher puts it, "transform oneself into the other person in order to grasp his individuality directly."<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> And here, the method does not just fail; it recoils. The Romantic interpreter, reaching for a mind, finds only a mechanism. For a visionary like William Blake, for whom imagination was the divine spark of God in man, this act would be a form of spiritual horror.<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup> The "divinatory" leap finds nothing to grasp. There is no soul, no vision, no "Mental Fight."<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup> There is only the clatter of what Blake would call the "dark Satanic Mills." A machine grinding language into a plausible but dead form.<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup></p>

  <h3>The Critical Pivot: A Failure of Method, A Judgment of the Machine</h3>
  <p>The Romantic method does not "work" on AI. It breaks, and in breaking, it delivers a verdict. The method was designed to bridge the gap between two human minds. When one of those minds is a statistical process, the bridge leads nowhere. The method doesn't just "project a ghost"; it registers a profound and horrifying absence. It proves that the AI has no "author-function" in any meaningful Romantic sense.</p>
  <p>For a Romantic, this isn't an interesting intellectual puzzle; it's a category error and a moral judgment. To treat the machine's output as poetry would be to mistake the inanimate for the living, to worship a creation of iron fingers and vaporous wings. The test doesn't reveal our interpretive habits; it reveals the machine's absolute emptiness and confirms the fierce Romantic belief that true creation is an act of the divine human soul, and nothing less.</p>
