            <h2>8 On the tiresome repetition of the author</h2>
            <p>One encounters, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngRcptQHbfc">discourses such as this</a>, a perfect articulation of the anxieties that arise when a discursive formation begins to fracture. The artist's lament is not, as she imagines, a defense of art itself, but rather a defense of the historically specific function of the "author" as the sacred origin of meaning—a function now threatened by the anonymous productivity of the machine.</p>
            <p>Her entire argument is constructed upon a romanticized and thoroughly unexamined belief in the sovereign subject. The valorization of the "laborious process," the "human touch," and the "intentional" mark are all appeals to a humanist mythology. She claims that upon learning an image is machine-made, her "interest immediately evaporates." This is not an aesthetic judgment but a disciplinary one; it is the policing of a boundary, an attempt to reassert the author's privilege and to disqualify a new mode of production that operates outside its rules.</p>
            <p>Most telling is the dismissal of the machine's process as merely "statistically probable" and therefore "not interesting." This is a profound failure of the critical faculty. It is precisely because the image is a statistical culmination—a visualization of the anonymous rules governing a massive archive of human expression—that it becomes a fascinating object. It is a text stripped of the pretense of individual genius. It bypasses the author entirely to reveal the underlying regularities of the discourse itself.</p>
            <p>The fear of the machine is, in fact, the fear of anonymity—the fear of a world where the old, familiar questions we pose to a work of art become obsolete. The endless, tiresome search for the "person behind the work" must give way to a more rigorous analysis of the work itself as an event within a system of power and knowledge.</p>
<pre><code>
'Who is the real author?'
'Have we proof of his authenticity and originality?'
'What has he revealed of his most profound self in his language?'

New questions will be heard:
'What are the modes of existence of this discourse?'
'Where does it come from; how is it circulated; who controls it?'
</code></pre>
            <p>This technological shift does not represent the end of art. It represents the potential end of our reliance on the author as a guarantor of meaning. It forces an interrogation of the very categories of creation, originality, and the human subject. It is not something to be feared, but a rupture to be analyzed.</p>
