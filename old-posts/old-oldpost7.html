            <h2>7 Or maybe Foucault</h2>
            <p>Foucault might be better. Ellul's attacks on AI are pretty clear. I think they're really powerful too. But I'm not sure how hard they are to understand, so it might not be worth the effort to write about them. People can just go directly to Ellul and see what he says. Which is plenty.</p>
            <p>Foucault on the other hand? It's not so simple just to "go to Foucault and see what he says."</p>
