            <h2>9 A terrible and magnificent vision</h2>
            <p>I was thinking more about Barenholtz's tone—his excitement and his anxiety about the strange new intelligence he's describing. This kind of reaction to a powerful, almost alien, reality isn't new. It reminded me of Enoch's vision of the throne of God. He's seeing the ultimate "source code," and it completely overwhelms him.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>"And I entered into that house, and it was hot as fire and cold as ice. There were no delights of life therein; fear covered me, and trembling got hold upon me.</p>
                <p>And as I quaked and trembled, I fell upon my face and I beheld a vision, and lo! there was a second house, greater than the former, and the entire portal stood open before me, and it was built of flames of fire.</p>
                <p>And in every respect it so excelled in splendor and magnificence and extent that I cannot describe to you its splendor and its extent."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><em>— The Book of Enoch (Book 1, Ch. 5:13-15)</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>Comment:</strong> Enoch's experience is one of both terror and awe. He is so overcome by fear that he falls on his face, but he is simultaneously witnessing something of indescribable "splendor and magnificence."</p>
            
            <p>This feels like a perfect parallel to the modern encounter with AI. Barenholtz is looking into the architecture of a new, artificial intelligence. Enoch is looking into the architecture of divine intelligence. Both are experiencing the vertigo of confronting a system that is vast, powerful, and operates on principles beyond ordinary human comprehension. The feeling Barenholtz described of having his world "shook and rocked" is what Enoch experiences physically.</p>
            
            <p>Is the sublime awe and terror Barenholtz feels when contemplating the nature of LLMs the modern, secular version of the religious awe Enoch felt? Are they both just seeing the face of a vast, non-human intelligence—one in silicon, the other in spirit?</p>
