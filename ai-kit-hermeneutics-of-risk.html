    <h1>AI and the Hermeneutics of Risk: New Forms of Dialogue and Danger</h1>
    <p>As the preceding pages have shown, the ideas that an author can be absent, that a text can "read" you, and that a book can be "dangerous" are all classical concepts in the history of hermeneutics. Artificial intelligence does not invent these problems, but it does introduce new forms and intensities of them. A clear-eyed hermeneutics of AI requires us to distinguish between the traditional risks of interpretation and the novel risks posed by a computational medium.</p>

      <h2>The Asymmetric Dialogue: From Metaphorical to Computational Reading</h2>
      <p>The "dialogue" with a traditional text, as described by Gadamer, is a metaphor for a transformative intellectual and emotional experience. The text acts upon you, but it does not know you. The interaction with a large language model is different in kind. It is an <em>asymmetric dialogue</em>:
        <ul>
            <li>You interpret the AI's output.</li>
            <li>Simultaneously, the AI system is computationally interpreting <em>you</em>. It processes your prompts, analyzes your language, and builds a predictive model of your intentions, knowledge, and needs in order to generate its next response.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>While a book changes you through a metaphorical conversation, an AI changes you through a literal feedback loop. This crucial difference—between being metaphorically understood and computationally modeled—is the source of the new risks associated with AI.</p>

      <h2>Two Categories of Hermeneutic Risk</h2>
      <p>We can organize the potential dangers of AI into two distinct categories, each relating to a different direction of the interpretive act.</p>

      <h3>1. The Risks of Reading AI-Generated Texts</h3>
      <p>These are risks that arise from our interpretation of the machine's output. They are often intensified versions of the dangers posed by any powerful text.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sophisticated Misinformation:</strong> The "dangerous book" tradition warns of texts that spread falsehoods. AI can generate such texts (e.g., propaganda, fake news) with unprecedented scale and personalization, making them potentially more effective and harder to identify.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural Homogenization:</strong> An LLM, as a "blurry JPEG of the web" (Ted Chiang), tends to reproduce the most statistically common patterns from its training data. A risk of over-reliance on such texts is a potential flattening of linguistic and cultural diversity, reinforcing a global monoculture.</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden Bias:</strong> The training data for large models contains the collected biases of human society. AI texts can reproduce and amplify these biases (racism, sexism, etc.) under a veneer of objective, machine-generated neutrality. Reading such texts uncritically risks internalizing these harmful ideologies. This calls for a "hermeneutics of suspicion," as advocated by Paul Ricoeur, to unmask these latent structures.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. The Risks of Being Read by an AI System</h3>
      <p>These are risks that arise from the system's interpretation of us. They are unique to interactive, computational media.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Extraction and Surveillance:</strong> Our interactions with an AI are data. This data can be stored, analyzed, and used for purposes unknown to us. This model of data capture has been described by scholars like Shoshana Zuboff as "surveillance capitalism," where personal experience is treated as a free raw material.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduction and Categorization:</strong> To process your input, an AI must categorize you and your request. The risk is that this computational model of you is a radical simplification of your personhood. You are reduced to a set of predictable patterns, and your unique identity is flattened into a type.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithmic Shaping of the Self:</strong> As the AI models you, it tailors its responses to what it predicts you want or need. This creates a powerful feedback loop that can subtly shape your thoughts, desires, and even your sense of self. This aligns with Michel Foucault's concept of "technologies of the self," where modern forms of power operate by shaping individuals from within.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A complete hermeneutics for the age of AI must therefore be a dual practice: a critical reading of the machine's words, and a critical awareness of how the machine is, in turn, reading us.</p>
