            <p>I'm not opposed to writing things with AI. I've got things out there making the case that nobody should be expected to reveal whether they used AI to create something (anything) or did it "totally by hand." So I'm not against AI writing and I'm against forcing anyone into AI disclosures.</p>
            <p>That said, this is all just my thoughts, typed out one word at a time.</p>
            <p>The code, though, is a different story. I've been using Gemini's coding-in-the-terminal tool. It's free, and I've gotten the hang of it. I like it.</p>
