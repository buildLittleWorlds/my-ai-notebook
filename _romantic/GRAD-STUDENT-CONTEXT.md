# GRAD-STUDENT-CONTEXT — Romantic Quick Kit

## What this section is (and isn’t)

**Romantic Quick Kit** is the site’s **systematic, out-of-character framework** for interpreting Romantic literature and thought. It provides methods and concepts you can actually apply while reading—formal, instructional, and cross-referenced (not exploratory posts, and not fiction)  .
Keep the kit **non-fictional**: no in-character scenes or invented Densworld documents here; those belong to Archive/Debate .

## Where the Romantic Kit sits in the site

The site has **Writing** (Blog Posts), **Frameworks** (Romantic + AI Hermeneutics Kits), and **Fictional Collections** (Archive + Debate). Romantic Quick Kit is one of the two real theory pillars and links from `/romantic/romantic-quick-kit/`  .

## Governing perspective (how the kit thinks)

All kit pages use the **two-rail** approach:

* **Psychological**: the work’s pattern of choices
* **Grammatical**: the conventions it engages
* **Authenticity**: coherence you can **demonstrate** between the two .

## The shape of the collection (what’s in the kit)

The hub (`romantic-quick-kit.md`) plus component pages: **Hermeneutics** (method), **core concepts** (Authenticity; Organic Form; Gefühl; Technology & the Machine), **national contexts** (Germany/England/America), and **reference** (Glossary)  .

## Typical work you’ll do here

* **Method pages** — “How to read for \[concept].”
* **Key concept pages** — define, historicize, cross-reference, apply.
* **Context pages** — national/historical anchoring.
* **Reference pages** — glossary/cross-index.
  All in kit-voice: instructional, systematic, definitive, and cross-linked .

## File and layout basics

* **Naming**: `romantic-kit-[topic].md`; hub = `romantic-quick-kit.md` .
* **Front matter**:

  ```yaml
  ---
  layout: kit
  title: "Page Title"
  kit_type: romantic
  ---
  ```


* **Location**: `_romantic/your-filename.md` .
* **Top nav pill**: add the “← Back to Quick Kit Menu” link from the snippet in the workflow .

## Standard page template (use this every time)

1. **Conceptual Definition** — what the concept means in Romantic theory
2. **How to Read For \[Concept]** — a step-by-step method
3. **Historical Development** — where it comes from/how it travels
4. **Cross-References** — related kit pages
5. **Application Examples** — concrete, minimally quoted demonstrations&#x20;
   **6) Densworld Addendum (seed) — 2–4 sentences, out-of-character**
   A tiny hand-off that imagines how this concept might surface in the fictional world **without** writing fiction in the kit page. See details below.

# Densworld Addendum for Romantic Kit pages (short, required)

**Why add this to a theory page?**
Blog posts already end with a required **Densworld Addendum (seed)** that can connect to either Archive or Debate. We'll do the **same, in miniature**, on each Romantic Kit page so theory cleanly "hands off" to fiction builders—still **out-of-character** to respect the kit's non-fiction boundary.

**Choose Your Connection Path:**

### Archive Connection (for concrete scenarios)
When your concept suggests **concrete Densworld scenes, artifacts, or practices**:
* A **concrete image, device, practice, or scene-seed** your concept suggests (one beat, not a whole vignette)
* A **proposed Order** and a **likely Region** for where an Archivist would file the future fictional document

### Debate Connection (for methodological questions)  
When your concept suggests **methodological questions or archival policy issues**:
* A concrete archival policy problem or interpretive question your concept raises
* A likely **Phase** (Phase I-IV of archival development)
* A likely **Document Type** and **Archivist Temperament**

**Template snippets** (append beneath your "Application Examples"):

```markdown
### Densworld Addendum (seed) — Archive Focus
**Order:** [Boundary | Doubling | Craving | Silence & Withdrawal | Violence & Secret Life | Mediation & Aperture]  
**Region:** [Capital | Dens/Densmok | Quarry | North/Northo | Tower/Sticks | Dead River | Capeast]

[2-4 sentences describing the concrete scene/artifact your concept suggests]

### Densworld Addendum (seed) — Debate Focus  
**Phase:** [Phase I | Phase II | Phase III | Phase IV]  
**Document Type:** [memo | minute | field report | hearing | counter-memo | directive | ruling | brief | case note | colloquy note]  
**Likely Temperament:** [Clerkly | Romantic | Philosophical]

[2-4 sentences describing the methodological question or policy debate your concept suggests]
```

**Three micro-examples (Archive vs. Debate paths):**

* **Authenticity (Archive path).** In **North Town**, trial singers perform a murder-song that only "authenticates" when a masked **echoer** repeats each line perfectly. → **Order: Doubling; Region: North Town** (archive entry documents echoer-song testimonies).
* **Authenticity (Debate path).** Do "performed authenticity" documents belong in **Doubling** or require a new sub-order? → **Phase III Hearing; Philosophical temperament** argues for category expansion; **Clerkly** resists.
* **Organic vs. Mechanical Form (Archive path).** A quarry wheel "self-assembles" from mismatched parts if turned in a precise rhythm; apprentices debate whether the form lives or is merely fitted. → **Order: Boundary; Region: Quarry**.

> Note: the **Orders + Regions** pairing mirrors how the Archive files fictional documents; Debate records the institutional fight over those classifications and even formalizes **dual-tagging** standards .

## Quick orientation for the brand-new grad student

1. Skim the hub to see components and navigation.
2. Read the **Hermeneutics** page to anchor on the two-rail method.
3. Pick **one concept** (e.g., Authenticity; Organic Form; Gefühl; Technology & the Machine) and **one national context** (Germany/England/America) to pair it with.
4. Draft using the **standard page template**, then tack on the **Densworld Addendum (seed)**.
5. Add cross-links (`relative_url`) to related kit pages and back to the hub .

## Success criteria (how we know a page “fits”)

* **Two-rail clarity** leads to an evidence-based authenticity claim .
* **Usable method** (your “How to Read” is actionable) and the **five core sections** are present .
* **Cross-references** to related kit pages and back to the hub .
* **Addendum seed** included (Archive format with Order + Region, or Debate format with Phase + Doc Type + Temperament) to hand off toward future fictional development.

## Submission checklist (copy/paste and tick)

* ✅ **Right section?** Systematic Romantic theory (not a post; not AI-specific; not fiction)&#x20;
* ✅ **Filename & front matter** follow kit specs&#x20;
* ✅ **Top nav pill** links back to the Quick Kit hub&#x20;
* ✅ **Five core sections** appear in order (Definition → How to Read → History → Cross-Refs → Applications)&#x20;
* ✅ **Densworld Addendum (seed)** present (Archive format: Order + Region, or Debate format: Phase + Doc Type + Temperament; 2–4 sentences; out-of-character)
