dedicated page for a more rigorous explanation.

*Anmut* (Grace)  
In Schiller's aesthetics, the visible manifestation of a "Beautiful
Soul." It is a "beauty of movement" that flows effortlessly from a
character whose inner inclinations are in perfect harmony with their
moral duty. It is the external sign of an unconflicted, unified self.

Authorial Intention  
In Romantic hermeneutics, not the author's private feelings, but the
organizing principle and unique style of a work. It is something the
interpreter **reconstructs** through textual evidence using the two-rail
method.

[Authenticity]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-authenticity/' | relative_url }})  
A demonstrable quality of a work that expresses a singular vision rather
than imitating external models. It is evidenced by a unique and coherent
style that unites form and content. In the German context, it is the
successful expression of the artist's foundational *Gefühl*.

Beautiful Soul (*schöne Seele*)  
Schiller's ideal of a person whose inner life is in perfect harmony.
Reason and desire, duty and inclination, are so seamlessly integrated
that moral action becomes a natural, graceful expression of the self.
Hegel later critiqued this ideal as a consciousness pathologically
obsessed with its own purity, leading to inaction.

[Bildungsroman / Crisis-Autobiography]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-hermeneutics/' | relative_url }})  
German for "formation-story." A narrative that traces the protagonist's
psychological and moral development, often through a spiritual crisis.
For Romantics, this became a primary genre, as in Wordsworth's *The
Prelude*, where the story of the poet's own life becomes an exemplary
journey of self-creation.

[Circuitous Journey]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-organic-form/' | relative_url }})  
A central Romantic plot, identified by M. H. Abrams, in which the
protagonist moves from a state of primal unity, through a painful fall
into alienation and division, toward a final return to a higher, more
complex and self-aware state of integration. This journey is often
described as a spiral or an ascending circle.

Denken  
(German: 'thinking'). In Romantic-Idealist thought, this refers to
conceptual, structured thought or cognition. It was often seen as a
secondary process that emerges from the more primary, immediate, and
receptive state of *Gefühl* (feeling).

Divinatory Method  
In Schleiermacher's hermeneutics, the necessary intuitive and
sympathetic leap the interpreter must make to grasp the author's
singular vision and originating impulse (*Keimentschluß*). It is an
attempt to "transform oneself into the other" to understand the text
from its psychological source.

Expressivism  
The theory of art, central to Romanticism, which holds that the primary
purpose of an artwork is to be an authentic expression of the artist's
inner life, their unique feelings, and their singular vision (*Gefühl*).

[Fragment]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-contexts-germany/' | relative_url }})  
A literary form, central to German Romanticism, that presents insights
as intentionally incomplete or aphoristic. It values the provocative and
open-ended over the closed, systematic treatise.

Gefühl  
(German: 'feeling'). A pivotal concept in German Romanticism and
Idealism, referring not to mere subjective emotion but to a fundamental,
pre-reflective, and immediate mode of awareness. For thinkers like
Schleiermacher, it is the ground from which conceptual thought
(*Denken*), religious piety, and artistic creation emerge.

[Grammatical / Psychological Rails]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-hermeneutics/' | relative_url }})  
Schleiermacher’s two necessary lines of inquiry for interpretation: the
**grammatical** (analyzing the shared system of language and genre) and
the **psychological** (reconstructing the author's singular pattern of
choices).

Hard Heart (Hegel)  
In Hegel's critique, the pathological final stage of the "Beautiful
Soul." It is a consciousness so rigid in its own sense of purity that it
refuses to recognize or forgive the imperfections of those who act in
the world, leading to a state of judgmental hypocrisy and self-imposed
isolation.

[Hermeneutic Circle]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-hermeneutics/' | relative_url }})  
The iterative process of understanding where the meaning of the parts
informs the whole, and the evolving sense of the whole refines the
meaning of the parts.

Hermeneutics of Communion  
A model of reading, central to the Romantic project, where the ultimate
goal is not merely to understand a text's formal properties but to
achieve a temporary, sympathetic merging of the reader's consciousness
with the reconstructed consciousness of the author.

[Imagination vs. Fancy]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-contexts-england/' | relative_url }})  
Coleridge's crucial distinction. **Imagination** is the vital, creative
power that unifies and shapes material into an organic whole. **Fancy**
is a lesser, mechanical faculty that simply recombines existing elements
without transforming them.

Judging vs. Acting Conscience (Hegel)  
A dialectical conflict described by Hegel. The **Judging Conscience** is
the "Beautiful Soul," which refrains from action to preserve its purity
and condemns the world. The **Acting Conscience** is the figure who
engages with the messy, complex world, inevitably making compromises and
appearing "impure" from the absolutist standpoint of the judger.

Keimentschluß  
(German: 'seminal decision' or 'germinal resolve'). In Schleiermacher's
hermeneutics, the originating, unifying impulse of a work. It is the
moment where an author's foundational *Gefühl* fuses with nascent
thought and takes on a specific, generative direction—the "seed" from
which the entire work organically grows.

Kingdom of Ends / Kingdom of Individuals  
A conceptual shift from Kant to the Romantics. Kant's **Kingdom of
Ends** was a universal moral community united by shared, rational laws.
The Romantics transformed this into a **Kingdom of Individuals**, a
world where each person's highest duty is to their own unique, inner
moral law or authentic self, often placing them in opposition to a
conformist society.

[The Machine (Metaphor)]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-technology-machine/' | relative_url }})  
A metaphor for any system (industrial, social, aesthetic) that feels
rigid, impersonal, and dehumanizing. The central counter-concept to the
**organic**.

[Mechanical Form]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-organic-form/' | relative_url }})  
For Coleridge, a form imposed on material from the outside, like a mold.
It is the direct opposite of **Organic Form**. It follows pre-set rules
and is associated with "Fancy."

[Mischgedicht]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-contexts-germany/' | relative_url }})  
(German: 'mixed poem/genre'). A term central to Friedrich Schlegel's
theory, describing the *Roman* as a genre that intentionally fuses
different forms (epic, lyric, dramatic) and modes (poetry, prose,
criticism). It is the structural basis of "progressive universal
poetry."

Moral Contamination  
A core Romantic anxiety that entanglement with an impure world—corrupt
institutions, cities, or unethical people—can stain or violate the
integrity of the authentic, inner self. This fear makes [Principled
Withdrawal](#principled-withdrawal) a primary ethical strategy.

[Natural Supernaturalism]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-technology-machine/' | relative_url }})  
A phrase from Carlyle’s *Sartor Resartus* that M. H. Abrams used to
describe the Romantic secularization of inherited theological patterns
(fall, redemption, apocalypse) into a worldview grounded in mind and
nature.

[Naturphilosophie]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-organic-form/' | relative_url }})  
A movement in German Idealism that viewed nature as a single, dynamic,
self-organizing organism, providing the philosophical basis for the
theory of organic form.

[Organic Form]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-organic-form/' | relative_url }})  
The principle that a work’s form should grow from its inner idea, like a
plant from a seed. This "seed" is often identified with the
*Keimentschluß*. The form is shaped by the creative "Imagination."

Principled Withdrawal  
An ethical stance, born of the fear of [Moral
Contamination](#moral-contamination), in which an individual
deliberately retreats from engagement with a corrupt world or person in
order to preserve their own inner purity and authenticity. It elevates
solitude and non-complicity into a moral ideal.

[Progressive Universal Poetry]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-contexts-germany/' | relative_url }})  
Friedrich Schlegel's term for the ultimate goal of Romantic art. It was
not just an abstract idea but was specifically embodied in the genre of
the *Roman*, which he saw as a 'Mischgedicht' capable of endlessly
combining all forms of art and knowledge.

[Roman (Schlegelian)]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-contexts-germany/' | relative_url }})  
For Friedrich Schlegel, not just the modern novel, but the central,
all-encompassing genre of modern (i.e., post-classical) art. Following
Herder, he included medieval romances, the works of Dante, Cervantes,
and even Shakespeare's plays under this term. The *Roman* was the
vehicle for "progressive universal poetry" and the highest form of
*romantische Poesie*.

[Romantic Hermeneutics]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-hermeneutics/' | relative_url }})  
The methodical art of interpretation, based on the premise that
misunderstanding is the norm. It uses the hermeneutic circle and the two
rails to reconstruct a work's meaning.

[Romantic Irony]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-contexts-germany/' | relative_url }})  
A mode of writing, central to German Romanticism, where a work
demonstrates self-awareness of its own constructedness. It signals the
artist's freedom over their material.

[The 'Self' (Subjectivity)]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-authenticity/' | relative_url }})  
For the Romantics, the inner life of the individual (consciousness,
emotion, memory, and vision) which they elevated as the primary source
of truth and the proper subject of art. This represented a profound
challenge to the Cartesian starting point of "I think" (*cogito*),
proposing instead a consciousness grounded in a primordially affective,
relational, and embodied state (*Gefühl*).

*Sittlichkeit* (Ethical Life)  
Hegel's term for a concrete, realized morality grounded in the shared
customs, institutions, and social fabric of a community (family, civil
society, the state). It stands in contrast to the abstract, inner
morality of the "Beautiful Soul," proposing that true ethical life is
achieved through participation, not withdrawal.

The Sublime  
An aesthetic experience of awe, terror, and vastness that overwhelms
rational understanding. It was contrasted with the Beautiful (which is
calm, orderly, and pleasing). The Sublime is often found in wild,
untamed nature.

[Theodicy (Secular / Private)]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-authenticity/' | relative_url }})  
Traditionally a justification of God's goodness in the face of evil. The
Romantics adapted this into a secular project, attempting to justify the
existence of suffering and loss in an individual's life by showing it
was necessary for the growth of the mind and the achievement of a higher
consciousness.

[Volksgeist]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-contexts-germany/' | relative_url }})  
Literally, "spirit of the people." Herder's idea that each nation or
culture has its own unique character, language, and creative genius,
which is the source of its authentic art (e.g., folk tales, ballads).
