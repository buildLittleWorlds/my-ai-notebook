# Graduate Student Workflow — Romantic Quick Kit

## Quick Overview

**Romantic Quick Kit** is a **systematic theoretical framework** (out-of-character) for interpreting Romantic literature and thought. You're creating academic theory designed for practical application in reading and analysis.

### Key Principle:
This is **instructional theory-building** — systematic, cross-referenced, practical methods that others can use to analyze Romantic texts and concepts.

---

## Step 1: Identify Your Content Type

### What Belongs in Romantic Quick Kit:
- **Interpretive methods**: "How to read for [concept]"
- **Systematic theory**: Definitions, applications, examples  
- **Historical contexts**: German, English, American Romantic developments
- **Cross-referenced concepts**: Authenticity, organic form, Gefühl, etc.
- **Practical frameworks**: Tools for actual textual analysis

### What Does NOT Belong Here:
- Work-in-progress reflections (those go in `_posts/`)
- AI-specific interpretive methods (those go in `_ai_hermeneutics/`)
- Fictional examples from Densworld (keep theory collections non-fictional)

---

## Step 2: Choose Your Framework Approach

### Kit Voice Markers:
- **Instructional**: "Apply this method by..." "To read for authenticity..."
- **Systematic**: Organized frameworks with clear components
- **Definitive**: Presents established methods rather than open questions  
- **Cross-referenced**: Extensive internal linking between concepts

### Content Types in the Kit:

#### Core Method Pages:
- **Hermeneutics**: The fundamental two-rail interpretive approach
- **Key concepts**: Authenticity, organic form, etc.

#### Context Pages:
- **National contexts**: How Romanticism developed differently across cultures
- **Historical development**: Philosophical foundations to literary applications

#### Reference Pages:
- **Glossary**: Essential terms and definitions
- **Cross-index**: Connections between concepts

---

## Step 3: Technical Specifications

### File Naming:
```
romantic-kit-[topic].md
```
Examples: `romantic-kit-authenticity.md`, `romantic-kit-contexts-germany.md`

### Special Hub File:
```
romantic-quick-kit.md (main framework overview)
```

### Required Front Matter:
```yaml
---
layout: kit
title: "Page Title"
kit_type: romantic
---
```

### File Location:
Place in: `_romantic/your-filename.md`

---

## Step 4: Content Structure Standards

### Standard Page Template:

#### Opening Navigation:
```markdown
<div class="top-links">
<a href="{{ '/romantic/romantic-quick-kit/' | relative_url }}" class="quickkit-pill">← Back to Quick Kit Menu</a>
</div>
```

#### Core Content Sections:
1. **Conceptual Definition**: What this concept means in Romantic theory
2. **How to Read For [Concept]**: Practical interpretive method
3. **Historical Development**: How the concept evolved
4. **Cross-References**: Links to related kit concepts
5. **Application Examples**: How to apply this in analysis

### Hub Page Structure:
The main `romantic-quick-kit.md` should:
- **Overview** the complete framework
- **Link to all component pages** with brief descriptions
- **Explain the two-rail method** as foundational approach
- **Provide navigation** between related concepts

---

## Step 5: Core Theoretical Framework

### The Two-Rail Method (Foundation):
All Romantic Kit pages build on this interpretive approach:
- **Psychological side**: The work's unique pattern of choices
- **Grammatical side**: The conventions it engages with  
- **Authenticity**: Demonstrable coherence between the two sides

### Key Romantic Concepts to Cover:

#### Essential Concepts:
- **Authenticity**: Aesthetic achievement, not mere confession
- **Organic Form**: Self-generated structure vs. imposed form
- **Gefühl**: Pre-reflective awareness, not simple emotion
- **Natural Supernaturalism**: Transcendence through nature

#### National Contexts:
- **German Romanticism**: Philosophical foundations, systematic thinking
- **English Romanticism**: Literary expression, nature poetry
- **American Romanticism**: Democratic adaptation, individualism

---

## Step 6: Cross-Reference System

### Internal Linking Requirements:
Every kit page should:
- **Link back to main hub**: `romantic-quick-kit.md`
- **Cross-reference related concepts**: Use Jekyll's relative_url filter
- **Connect to hermeneutics method**: Show how concept applies the two-rail approach
- **Reference appropriate national contexts**: Historical grounding

### Linking Syntax:
```markdown
Apply the [two-rail method]({{ '/romantic/romantic-kit-hermeneutics/' | relative_url }}) 
to demonstrate [authenticity]({{ '/romantic/romantic-kit-authenticity/' | relative_url }})...

This concept developed differently in 
[German Romanticism]({{ '/romantic/romantic-kit-contexts-germany/' | relative_url }})...
```

## Step 7: Content Development Process

### Research Phase:
1. **Primary sources**: Read Romantic texts, theoretical writings
2. **Secondary sources**: Engage with Romantic scholarship  
3. **Methodological focus**: How does this help interpret texts?
4. **Cross-connections**: How does this relate to other kit concepts?

### Writing Phase:
1. **Define clearly**: What exactly does this concept mean?
2. **Method development**: How do you read for this in practice?
3. **Historical grounding**: Where did this concept come from?
4. **Cross-reference**: How does this connect to other concepts?
5. **Application focus**: How do you actually use this?

### Integration Phase:
1. **Link to hub**: Update `romantic-quick-kit.md` with new content
2. **Cross-link**: Add references from related pages  
3. **Test navigation**: Ensure all links work correctly
4. **Update glossary**: Add new terms and definitions

---

## Step 8: Quality Standards

### Theoretical Rigor:
- **Historically accurate**: Faithful to Romantic thought and development
- **Conceptually precise**: Clear definitions and distinctions
- **Methodologically useful**: Practical tools for interpretation
- **Systematically coherent**: Consistent framework across all pages

### Pedagogical Effectiveness:
- **Clear instruction**: Students can follow the methods
- **Practical examples**: Show how concepts apply to actual texts
- **Progressive complexity**: Build from simple to complex applications
- **Cross-referenced learning**: Connections reinforce understanding

---

## Step 9: Integration with Site Ecosystem

### Relationship to Other Collections:

#### From Blog Posts → Romantic Kit:
- Blog posts **explore** Romantic concepts that get **systematized** in the kit
- Use kit pages to **formalize** ideas developed in blog reflections

#### Romantic Kit ↔ AI Hermeneutics Kit:
- Some interpretive methods **adapt** between traditional and AI texts
- **Cross-reference** when Romantic concepts inform AI interpretation

#### Theory Collections ≠ Fictional Collections:
- Romantic Kit provides **real academic frameworks**
- Do **NOT** include fictional examples from Densworld
- Keep theory collections **out-of-character** and scholarly

## Step 10: Expansion Priorities

### Core Content (Essential):
1. **Complete the hermeneutics method** — foundational approach
2. **Develop key concepts** — authenticity, organic form, Gefühl
3. **Establish national contexts** — Germany, England, America
4. **Create comprehensive glossary** — all essential terms

### Advanced Content (Development):
1. **Specific text applications** — how to read particular works
2. **Historical development** — evolution of Romantic thought
3. **Contemporary relevance** — how Romantic concepts apply today
4. **Comparative analysis** — Romanticism vs. other literary movements

### Cross-System Integration:
1. **Link to AI hermeneutics** — where Romantic methods inform AI interpretation  
2. **Connect to blog posts** — formalize exploratory thinking
3. **Reference from fictional work** — theoretical principles behind creative application

## Step 11: Example Page Development

### Sample Page: `romantic-kit-authenticity.md`

```yaml
---
layout: kit
title: "Authenticity (The Evidenced Self)"
kit_type: romantic
---
```

**Content Structure:**
1. **Navigation back to hub**
2. **Definition**: Authenticity as aesthetic achievement
3. **Two-rail method application**: Psychological/grammatical coherence
4. **National variations**: German Gefühl, English sincerity, American individualism
5. **Reading method**: Practical steps for analysis
6. **Cross-references**: Related concepts, historical contexts
7. **Contemporary application**: How this applies to modern interpretation

This systematic approach ensures the Romantic Quick Kit functions as a **complete interpretive framework** rather than just a collection of essays, while maintaining integration with the site's broader academic and creative project.
