English Romanticism translated the philosophical energy of Germany into
a concrete poetic revolution. Centered on figures like William
Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the movement's formal beginning
is often dated to their 1798 collaboration, *Lyrical Ballads*. Their
work was shaped by the twin upheavals of the French and Industrial
Revolutions.

### Signature Ideas in Practice

- **[Authenticity]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-authenticity/' | relative_url }}) in Language and
  Subject:** The program's core, laid out in Wordsworth’s "Preface to
  Lyrical Ballads," was a radical call for authenticity. It rejected
  neoclassical artifice in favor of "the very language of men" and found
  its subjects in the "common life," dignifying the experiences of
  rustic and marginalized people.
- **[Organic Form]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-organic-form/' | relative_url }}) in Practice:**
  Coleridge was the key conduit for German ideas on organicism. He
  argued that a poem's form must grow from within, like a plant, shaped
  by the "seminal principle" of the imagination. This rejected the
  "mechanic" application of classical rules and genres.
- **The Creative Imagination:** For the English Romantics, the
  imagination was not mere fantasy. It was a truth-seeing faculty.
  Coleridge distinguished between the "primary imagination" (the active
  power of perception shared by all) and the "secondary imagination"
  (the artist's conscious power to dissolve, diffuse, and dissipate in
  order to recreate).
- **Nature as a Moral Force:** In the face of growing industrialization,
  the English Romantics idealized nature as a source of spiritual truth,
  moral wisdom, and emotional restoration. Wordsworth’s poetry, in
  particular, explores the deep, sympathetic connection between the
  human mind and the natural world.

Wordsworth's ultimate ambition, as M. H. Abrams shows, was to write the
great modern epic, a successor to Milton's *Paradise Lost*. But
Wordsworth's epic would replace Milton's supernatural drama with a
"natural supernaturalism." Its subject would not be the fall of man from
heaven, but the growth of the poet's own mind. Its high argument would
be the "spousal verse" celebrating the redemptive "marriage" between a
creative mind and a living Nature, which together could create a
paradise on earth, here and now. This project recast the entire
Christian story into a personal, psychological, and natural framework.

### The Social Horizon

The movement cannot be understood apart from its historical moment.

- **Revolution and Disillusionment:** The early Romantics were radical
  supporters of the French Revolution's ideals. Their later
  disillusionment with its violence and the rise of Napoleon turned
  their focus inward, toward the redemptive power of the individual mind
  and nature.
- **The "Mechanical Age":** Reacting against Blake's "dark Satanic
  mills," Romantic poetry often positioned the [pastoral and the
  wild]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-technology-machine/' | relative_url }}) as a necessary refuge from
  the alienation of industrial city life.
