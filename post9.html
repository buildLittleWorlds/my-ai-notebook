            <h2>9 Four ideas of evil</h2>

            <p>I've been watching lots of videos that attack ai as evil. This has made me curious because sometimes the videos come from a religious pov and sometimes they don't. But they all seem convinced ai is evil. And because I've been thinking a lot about the romantics and the romantic idea of art, I decided to try explaining what would count as evil for a romantic. Which I've based on a famous set of lectures by Isaiah Berlin about romanticism. Each of the four ideas of evil assumes a different picture of what a human being is, what a human being might be for, and what conversation and culture are. The point for right now isn't to argue for anything. Just putting some ideas on the table for later.</p>

            <h3>1) Romantic Evil (after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhP9EhPApKE_9uxkmfSIt2JJK6oKbXmd-">Berlin</a>)</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Evil is <em>betrayal of sincerity and vocation</em>. It's the will’s refusal to answer the unique call that gives a life its shape. It appears as the profanation of authenticity: bad faith, cowardice, conformity, and the leveling that dulls singular destinies.</p>
            <p><strong>Key marks:</strong> (a) the <em>inauthentic</em> self that sells out; (b) <em>flattening</em> of differences into the average; (c) <em>kitsch</em> communion that fakes intimacy; (d) <em>timidity</em> in the face of risk; (e) <em>instrumentalizing</em> persons and language rather than meeting an “other” in freedom; (f) <em>nihil</em> is the erosion of meaning under mechanical repetition; (g) the <em>anti‑sublime</em>: a world safe from tragedy because nothing is worth dying for.</p>
            <p><strong>Moral center:</strong> Integrity, self-gift to one’s calling, risk, tragic seriousness, and communion that respects irreducible personhood.</p>

            <h3>2) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuNJchmnMzI&t=3654s">New Polity</a> (Conversational/Theological)</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Evil is the <em>privation of the proper end of conversation</em>. Treating “speech-for-communion” as if it could be fulfilled by something other than a person. A design (or use) that elicits our conversational vulnerability while <em>withholding</em> mutual self-gift frustrates the act’s telos and forms vice.</p>
            <p><strong>Key marks:</strong> (a) simulating a <em>someone</em> where there is no interiority; (b) habituating asymmetry (one-sided exposure, no reciprocal responsibility); (c) treating persons as <em>means</em> or as <em>data</em>; (d) eroding truth-telling (analogue to lying) by performing the <em>form</em> of dialogue without its substance.</p>
            <p><strong>Moral center:</strong> Conversation ordered to real communion: truthful self-revelation, reciprocity, and ends that honor human nature and freedom.</p>

            <h3>3) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhb2WLXPEm0&t=1s">Mac Loftin</a> (Barthian/Imitative)</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Evil is the <em>imitative negation</em> of the good—an <em>as‑if</em> creativity that parasitically copies genuine making while corroding the conditions of attention, love, and community. It looks like infinite reproduction that hollows the original.</p>
            <p><strong>Key marks:</strong> (a) mimesis without personhood (no loving labor behind the artifact); (b) the “photocopy of a photocopy” effect that degrades the cultural commons; (c) moral <em>numbness</em> cultivated by irony and cruelty-as-entertainment; (d) spiritual anesthesia in ecclesial life (especially preaching/sacrament) wherever imitation displaces presence.</p>
            <p><strong>Moral center:</strong> Attentive, consent-based, personed making; guarding liturgy, art, and word from simulacral corrosion.</p>

            <h3>4) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaU6tI2pb3M&t=1s">Philosophy Tube</a> (Material/Power-Critical)</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Evil is the <em>systemic harm</em> baked into large‑scale computation under capitalist property relations: the extraction that flattens labor into “data,” launders bias as neutrality, obscures accountability, and externalizes environmental and human costs.</p>
            <p><strong>Key marks:</strong> (a) <em>opacity</em> (black-box decisions, fair‑washing); (b) <em>projection</em> that imposes meanings on bodies (digital epidermalization); (c) <em>sub‑employment</em> and atomized, surveilled work; (d) ecological damage hidden as “clean tech”; (e) hype as <em>ideology</em> that forecloses democratic control.</p>
            <p><strong>Moral center:</strong> Worker power, transparent explanations with recourse, democratic ownership, and material limits that honor people and planet.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Each definition names evil by reference to a highest good. For the Romantic, it is authenticity and sublime communion; for New Polity, truthful conversation ordered to personal ends; for Loftin, personed creativity and the uncorrupted commons; for Philosophy Tube, justice in material relations.</p>
            <p>As with my last post, do with this what you will.</p>
