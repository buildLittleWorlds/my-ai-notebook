            <h2>9 Romantic Evil (after Isaiah Berlin)</h2>

<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>This page offers a compact statement of a <em>Romantic</em> account of evil—drawn from Isaiah Berlin’s portrait of Romanticism—without assessing it or contrasting it with rivals. The aim is to articulate the vision from the inside.</p>

<h3>Romantic Evil (after Berlin)</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Evil is any betrayal of <em>vocation</em> and <em>sincerity</em>—a refusal of the singular call that gives a life its shape. It is the willing exchange of destiny for comfort, of tragic seriousness for safety, of living speech for empty forms.</p>

<h3>Marks of Evil</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inauthenticity:</strong> bad faith, selling out, self-betrayal; speaking words one does not inhabit.</li>
<li><strong>Levelling:</strong> the flattening of irreducible difference into averages, norms, and interchangeable roles.</li>
<li><strong>Profaned Communion:</strong> “togetherness” without persons—kitsch intimacy that avoids risk and responsibility.</li>
<li><strong>Cowardice:</strong> fear of the sublime risk where something worth dying for is at stake; preference for the tepid middle.</li>
<li><strong>Instrumentalism:</strong> treating others (and language) as means, not as free centers that answer and demand answer.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanical Repetition:</strong> the erosion of meaning by rote forms that no longer reveal an interior life.</li>
<li><strong>The Anti‑Sublime:</strong> a world without tragedy because nothing ultimate is affirmed—no call, no pledge, no vow.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moral Center</h3>
<p>Goodness is integrity: self-gift to one’s call; fidelity under risk; conversation that meets a person as a person; and a willingness to suffer the tragic costs of living in truth. The Romantic conscience prizes the singular, the vowed, the answerable—over comfort, utility, and faceless universals.</p>
