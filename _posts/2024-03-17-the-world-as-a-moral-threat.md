Once you locate the ultimate source of meaning and morality within the [individual's authentic soul](/post-74), a profound shift occurs. The entire external world (society, its institutions, even other people) is recast. It is no longer a neutral space for action, but a potential source of corruption, a threat to the integrity of the self. This deep-seated anxiety about moral contamination is not a timeless feature of the human condition; it is a specific, historical consequence of the Romantic turn inward.

This new ethical system created a fundamental antagonism between the individual and the collective. For the Romantics, conformity became the cardinal sin. Society was seen as an inimical force that imposes false roles and violates the sanctity of the true, inner self. A strong expression of this was the critique of the city and the machine. As I've explored when thinking about [the machine as a metaphor](/romantic-kit-technology-machine), Romantics like William Blake saw the industrial city as a landscape of spiritual decay. His vision of "dark Satanic Mills" in the preface to *Milton*, which I referenced in [a previous post](/post-53), was not just a social critique; it was a theological one. The factories were a physical manifestation of a mechanistic worldview that was actively destroying the "Divine Humanity."

This anxiety extended beyond the city into the realm of personal relationships. If the highest duty is to be true to oneself, then any relationship that demands compromise poses a direct threat to one's moral purity. Entanglement with an unethical person is not just unpleasant; it is a source of potential contamination. It forces a choice between one's relational bonds and one's own moral standards.

In response to this perceived threat, the Romantic imagination required an ethics of principled withdrawal. The solitary figure, the isolated artist, the defiant hero, the prophet in the wilderness was elevated into an ethical ideal. The artist's isolation was not a social failure but a necessary act of self-preservation. This is the core logic behind the impulse to boycott. It is an act of withdrawal, an attempt to protect one's own moral purity from a contaminating association. It is a modern expression of an ethics that sees the world not as a home, but as a threat.
