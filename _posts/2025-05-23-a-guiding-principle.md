I'm starting from scratch with this blog. What are my actual thoughts about AI? I've been absorbed in AI as a writing professor and on my own time for a few years. It's a good idea sometimes. Start over and pretend not to have any opinions yet. So that's the goal of this site.

I do have a working principle, though. Writers should be free. They should experiment and try things out. I'm not afraid of AI. AI-built stuff doesn't fill me with distaste or anxiety or anger. I use AI for plenty of things myself. And I am often underwhelmed. I can see that gap between AI-booster promises and the actual AI outputs. But I write with the tools at hand. And I think about everything. Nothing off-limits ahead of time. AI or not.
