Going back to my [last post,](/post-64) why is there such unanimity on this point? Why does everyone act like it's so obvious. We just HAVE TO KNOW when we're talking to AI or looking at AI or reading something a human [poured their soul into](/romantic-kit-authenticity).

This coming from people who don't believe in souls.

But why? I'm trying to understand but it is really hard for me. I can't relate at all and I have really strong insticts that go the other way.

Maybe it's this. I *do* want to know if I'm interacting with a real human in real time physically right in front of me. I don't want to live in a world in which physical robots in physical space with me become indistinguishable from humans. I'm not ready to articulate why. But I share that impulse.

But once something has been separated from the physical human author or creator, it lives in a world of its own. It already becomes a kind of virtual thing. This is what authorship means. This is why Socrates was so fundamentally against the act of writing to begin with:

> I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately like painting; for the creations of the painter have the attitude of life, and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn silence. And when they have been once written down they are tumbled about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them, and know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or abused, they have no parent to protect them; and they cannot protect or defend themselves. â€”Plato, [*Phaedrus*](https://classics.mit.edu/Plato/phaedrus.html)

So the moment you put pen to paper, you've already crossed the line into the virtual. The text becomes an orphan, cut off from its human creator, an idea that gets a philosophical name with the concept of [distanciation](/ai-kit-distanciation). It doesn't matter whether a human or an AI wrote it; both are equally separated from their source once written.

So why this obsession with labeling? If we're already comfortable reading books by dead authors, [engaging with ideas that have been severed](/ai-kit-death-author) from their living creators for centuries, why does it suddenly matter so much whether the text was generated by biological or artificial intelligence? The separation Socrates worried about happened the moment writing was invented.
