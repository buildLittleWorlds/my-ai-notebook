I've been listening to Elan Barenholtz, a cognitive scientist at Florida Atlantic University, and he has this idea that language is a kind of external system running on our mental hardware. It sounds metaphorical, but his logic for taking it literally is built on what Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown us.

He starts with the provocative claim that language isn't something we create, but something that gets installed in us.

> And then this is where, you know, it starts to get a little bit disturbing. Language is an autonomous informational system, one might even call it an organism, and it runs in our brains. It's downloaded against your will. By the time you're reading the waiver, it's too late.

How could that be possible? He argues it's because LLMs have proven that language doesn't need to be connected to the real world to function. It's a self-contained system. If that's true, it doesn't need to be built by connecting words to our experiences. It can be acquired as a complete operating system.

> What large language models show us is that words don't mean anything outside of themselves... Language is an autonomous system. It's a self-contained system. It has the rules contained within it to generate itself... A large language model don't know what they're talking about in any real sense. They can talk about a sunset. They can talk about a taste... And yet we would say they have no idea what they're talking about.

If you accept that language is an autonomous system that isn't really "us," it leads to a strange conclusion. Barenholtz describes the personal feeling of this split, the realization that the part of him that thinks in words is separate from the part of him that feels and experiences. This is what shows how literally he takes the idea of an external system running inside him.

> ...the me that feels the warmth of the sun on my face and that feels the pressure of the of this chair on my body isn't the same me that is actually talking about it and that is a an uncomfortable realization... it it almost feels you know almost parasitic that there's another organism and it's not me that's living inside of me.

The idea is strange but has a clear logic to it. Language as a kind of informational parasite, separate from our original self. An external *technique* that got inside.
