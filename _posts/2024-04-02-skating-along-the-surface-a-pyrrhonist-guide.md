After exploring the commitments of the deep opt-in and the deep opt-out, it's time to work out a defense of the [third path](/post-63): skating along the surface. To do this, we can look at an ancient Greek tradition that perfected it. Pyrrhonism is not a set of doctrines to be learned, but an *agōgē*, a way of life, a disposition, and a practice. Its purpose is not to find the truth but to cure the mental distress that comes from believing you must.

The key figure is Pyrrho of Elis (c. 365-275 BCE), but since he wrote nothing, our understanding comes from later followers, most importantly Sextus Empiricus. For them, the philosopher is a "zetetic," or seeker, who is defined by their commitment to "continuing to investigate."

The Pyrrhonist practice is a repeatable psychological process:

- It begins when "men of talent," perturbed by contradictions in the world, set out to find what is true and what is false, hoping to find peace of mind.
- In their investigation, they discover *isosthenia*, or equipollence: for any claim about the true nature of things, an opposing argument of equal persuasive force can be found.
- Faced with this intellectual deadlock, the honest response is *epoché*, the suspension of judgment. You neither affirm nor deny the claim.
- Finally, a profound state of *ataraxia*, or tranquility, follows the suspension of judgment "as a shadow follows a body". Peace of mind arrives as an unexpected byproduct of giving up the search for it in dogmatic belief.

This might work as a basis for the skater's mindset. The AI debate, with its utopian versus dystopian conclusions, is a perfect case of *isosthenia*. The skater's refusal to get pulled into the hype is a modern practice of *epoché*. The goal of "waiting for the fever to break" is a search for *ataraxia*. But this raises the objection brought against skeptics for millennia: is such a life actually livable? If you suspend belief, won't you be paralyzed and unable to act?
