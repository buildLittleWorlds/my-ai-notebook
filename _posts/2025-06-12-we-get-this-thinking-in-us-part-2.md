The puzzle from the [last post](/post-22) is this sense of language as an autonomous system operating inside us. To get a handle on this, I use Ferdinand de Saussure. His work is over a century old, but it describes the world that large language models are now making explicit.

My quick summary here is from Jonathan Culler's book *Saussure*. Saussure gives us a structural way to look at language (and especially little language slips). It's not about what the speaker "really feels," but about the system she's trying to build. Here are the essential tools:

- ***Langue* is a social product:** Saussure distinguishes the social system of language (*langue*) from the individual's act of speaking (*parole*). Culler explains that *langue* is "the social product whose existence permits the individual to exercise his linguistic faculty."
- **Signs are arbitrary and relational:** The link between a word and a concept is a social convention, not a natural fact. The system works not by pointing to things in the world, but through the relationships between signs. The meaning of 'red' comes from it not being 'blue', 'green', or 'yellow'. It's a system of pure difference, what Saussure calls "form, not substance."

This is exactly the "profound shock" [Elan Barenholtz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIMw04GJJ7U&t=1059s) describes when he realizes that LLMs can produce perfect, meaningful language with zero connection to the physical world. He says:

> ...language models operate independently of any World Knowledge... language contains within it its ability to generate itself without any grounding in sensory physical knowledge... based on purely syntactic knowledge of the relations between these symbols...

Barenholtz, by looking at AI, rediscovered Saussure's central claim: language is a self-sufficient, relational machine. It doesn't need us, our feelings, or our experiences to function. It has its own logic. It just needs a host to run on.
