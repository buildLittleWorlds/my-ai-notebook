title: "The Author De-Mythologized: Art as Industrial Product"
post_number: 80

The core of the [pragmatic objection](/post-79) is its de-mythologized view of the author. The Romantic ideal of the solitary genius pouring their soul onto the page has been replaced by a more cynical, or perhaps simply more realistic, understanding of art as an industrial product. Today's most contested art forms (films, pop music, TV series) are the output of a vast, collaborative, and commercial apparatus.

In this model, the director, actor, or musician at the center of a controversy is not the singular, spiritual source of the work in the way a Romantic would understand it. They are the public face of the enterprise, the primary financial beneficiary, and the focal point of the marketing. In short, they are the CEO of the brand. The boycott is not a refusal to commune with a contaminating soul; it is a targeted economic action against the brand's most visible asset.

This perspective aligns perfectly with Michel Foucault's later, systematic analysis of the ["author-function."](/ai-kit-author-function) Foucault argued that the "author" is not a real person but a social construct, a principle of coherence we use to classify and control discourse. The pragmatic boycotter operates on this principle. They are not concerned with the artist's authentic *Gef√ºhl* but with their functional role as a figure of authority and economic power.

From a genealogical perspective, this view represents the historical triumph of the worldview the Romantics defined themselves against. The "Mechanical Age" that Thomas Carlyle diagnosed in his critique of [industrial logic](/romantic-kit-technology-machine) has, in this view, completely subsumed the world of art. The pragmatist does not mourn this shift; they accept it as reality and adapt their ethical strategies accordingly. They operate within the logic of the machine because they believe there is no other logic left. Their actions are a direct acknowledgment that the Romantics' battle to preserve a sacred, organic model of creation has been lost.
