A central tenet of the pragmatic critique is the "small agent problem": one person's refusal to stream a song or buy a ticket has no meaningful economic impact. So why does the act feel so morally urgent? The pragmatic view, focused on consequences, struggles to explain this intensity. The Romantic ethical point of view, however, accounts for it perfectly.

This requires tracing an important intellectual lineage. The Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant envisioned a universal "Kingdom of Ends," a moral commonwealth united by shared, rational laws. The Romantics inherited Kant's deontological structure (his focus on duty over consequences) but radically transformed its content. Thinkers like Fichte and Schlegel shifted the locus of moral duty inward. The supreme command was no longer to act on a universal law, but to be true to one's own unique, [authentic self](/romantic-kit-authenticity).

This move shattered the universal moral community into a "Kingdom of Individuals." The highest duty is not to fix the corrupt world, but to ensure one's own moral separateness from it. The boycott, then, is not primarily a tool for collective change but an expressive act of self-legislation. Its value is deontological, residing in the act itself (the preservation of one's moral integrity) regardless of the outcome.

The boycott becomes a "moral semaphore." Its purpose is not economic coercion but symbolic expression. It is a public affirmation of one's values and a refusal to be complicit in what one deems wrong. In a world where total moral purity seems impossible, the expressive boycott is a declaration that "effort still counts." It is an act of fidelity to the self, a profound echo of the Romantic imperative to prioritize the integrity of one's own soul above all else. This explains why the practical inefficacy of the act does not diminish its perceived moral necessity.
