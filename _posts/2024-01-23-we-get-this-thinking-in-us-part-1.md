There's a phrase at the beginning of [a video by an AI-optimist Youtuber, Julia McCoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lILWJ8v0IZI&t=219s). She's making the case for personal empowerment and breaking free from old mindsets. But right at the beginning of this call to agency, she says something strange:

> ...it's also really really important that we get this thinking in us...

"We get this thinking in us." It's an odd formulation. Thinking isn't something we typically "get" like a cold or a software update. Her explicit message is about choice and self-determination, but the grammar here is passive, deterministic. It sounds less like something we choose and more like something that happens to us. Like we're hosts.

It reminds me of a recent video of a neuroscientist named [Elan Barenholtz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIMw04GJJ7U&t=1059s). Here's him talking about large language models:

> ...the me that feels the warmth of the sun on my face and that feels the pressure of the of this chair on my body isn't the same me that is actually talking about it and that is a an uncomfortable realization... it it almost feels you know almost parasitic that there's another organism and it's not me that's living inside of me.

Two very different speakers, one an optimist and the other a scientist, arrive at the same strange place. They both, in their own way, describe language and thought as a system running independently inside the human host. This suggests the old Romantic vocabulary of authenticity and the individual soul won't help us here. We need a way to talk about the system itself.
