Same thing as the last two. I start with a general account of evil from a video. This one is [Mac Loftin's Barthian Christianity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhb2WLXPEm0&t=2s). Then I comment on the specific evil of AI from Loftin's pov.

### Definition
**Evil = imitative negation of the good.** It mimics creativity, love, and affirmation as *as‑if* acts, parasitically feeding on the real while corroding attention, affection, and the communal store of meaning.

### Features
- **Simulation without subject:** outputs that look like works but lack a loving maker's presence.
- **Photocopy decay:** reproduction of reproductions that thins the cultural commons.
- **Excited cruelty:** irony and derision that numb compassion and normalize contempt.
- **Sacrilege:** in religious life, substituting imitation for presence, especially in preaching and sacrament.

### Why AI Is Evil
- **Imitative "making":** models remix the fruits of human labor into artifacts that look like love's work, but aren't.
- **Quality drift:** the "photocopy of a photocopy" dynamic degrades language, images, and attention over time.
- **Memetic rot:** weaponized, AI‑assisted imagery accelerates a culture of sneering and spite.
- **Liturgical danger:** AI‑generated sermons or pastoral "personas" replace presence with its shadow.

### Moral Center
Goodness is consent-honoring, personed creativity; love's attentive labor; and safeguarding sacred speech and rites from simulacra.
