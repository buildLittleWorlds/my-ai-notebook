# Graduate Student Workflow — Blog Posts

## Quick Overview

**Blog Posts** are the site's *out-of-character* academic writing: real essays, arguments, and work-in-progress reflections by Professor Plate. They serve as a public research notebook for literary theory, hermeneutics, and AI interpretation — exploratory, first-person, and scholarly-but-readable.

### Key Principle:
This is **authentic academic blogging** — first person, reflective, conversational but scholarly. Posts function as the **engine of the site's ecosystem**, with ideas tested here becoming frameworks (kits) and fictional prompts (Archive/Debate).

---

## Step 1: Identify Your Subject Area

Focus your post within one of these **five recurring bands**:

### 1. Hermeneutics & Method-in-Use
- How we read; why methods help or mislead; where interpretation breaks down
- Questions assumptions, stages problems, leaves threads for later systematizing

### 2. AI & Interpretation  
- What AI-generated texts do to authorship, intention, and reading
- Tests the idea that AI's "newness" intensifies classic hermeneutic issues rather than creating rupture

### 3. Romanticism as a Live Method Bank
- Romantic concepts as tools: authenticity/sincerity, organic vs. mechanical form, technology & the machine
- Tries ideas on contemporary problems before kit-pages formalize them

### 4. Meta-critique, Pedagogy, and Scholarly Practice
- Freedom to experiment; skepticism toward compelled disclosure of method
- Defends process freedom, argues that privacy can protect creativity

### 5. Bridgework Across Collections
- Sketches ideas that later become kit pages or inspire fictional seeds for Archive/Debate
- The staging area for the site's integrated system

### What Does NOT Belong Here:
- Systematic frameworks → move to Romantic or AI Hermeneutics kits
- Fictional documents → move to `_archive/`
- Meta-archival debates → move to `_debate/`

## Step 2: Choose Your Voice & Approach

### Blog Post Voice Markers:
- **First person**: "I think," "This strikes me as," "I've been wondering"
- **Conversational but scholarly**: Direct address to readers, informal asides
- **Provisional**: "This might be wrong, but..." "I'm still working through..."
- **Reflective**: Questions that open rather than close discussions

### Tone Examples:
✓ "This puzzles me about AI interpretation..."  
✓ "I've been reading Butler's work and wondering..."  
✓ "Something about this Romantic concept bothers me..."  
✗ "Butler's theory of performativity states..." (too systematic for blog posts)  
✗ "The archivist noted the following slip..." (fictional, belongs in `_archive/`)

## Step 3: Technical Specifications

### File Naming:
```
2024-MM-DD-post-[number].md
```
Example: `2024-01-15-post-25.md`

### Required Front Matter:
```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
post_number: [integer]
date: 2024-01-15 10:00:00 -0500
---
```

### File Location:
Place in: `_posts/your-filename.md`

---

## Step 4: Content Structure

### Flexible Structure Options:

#### Option A: Question-Driven Post
1. **Opening question/problem**: What's puzzling you?
2. **Exploration**: Work through the thinking
3. **Provisional conclusion**: Where you've landed (for now)

#### Option B: Reading Response Post  
1. **What you're reading**: Book, article, theory
2. **What strikes you**: Key insights or problems
3. **Implications**: How this affects your thinking

#### Option C: Methodological Post
1. **The method/approach**: What you're trying to do
2. **The problem**: Where it breaks down or gets complicated
3. **Possible solutions**: Tentative ways forward

---

## Step 5: Content Guidelines

### Length & Depth:
- **Short posts (200-500 words)**: Single insight, quick reflection
- **Medium posts (500-1000 words)**: Developed argument, reading response
- **Long posts (1000+ words)**: Complex exploration, multiple threads

### Academic Standards:
- **Cite sources** when referencing specific works
- **Define terms** when introducing complex concepts
- **Acknowledge uncertainty** — it's okay not to have answers
- **Connect to larger questions** in literary theory and hermeneutics

### Voice Consistency:
- Maintain **first person** throughout
- Keep **conversational but scholarly** tone
- Show **thinking process**, not just conclusions
- **Question assumptions**, including your own

---

## Step 6: Integration with Site Ecosystem

### How Blog Posts Connect to Other Collections:

#### To Theory Collections (`_romantic/`, `_ai_hermeneutics/`):
- Blog posts **explore** ideas that later get **systematized** in theory collections
- Use blog posts to **work through problems** before formalizing frameworks
- Reference theory collections when you've already developed systematic approaches

#### To Fictional Collections (`_archive/`, `_debate/`):
- Blog posts can **reflect on the creative process** behind fictional work
- Can discuss **interpretive principles** that get demonstrated fictionally
- Should **NOT** contain fictional content directly

### Linking Examples:
```markdown
I've been developing this idea systematically in my 
[Romantic Quick Kit]({{ '/romantic/romantic-quick-kit/' | relative_url }}), 
but here I want to think through some problems...

This connects to the interpretive challenges I've been exploring 
in the [AI Hermeneutics framework]({{ '/ai-hermeneutics/ai-hermeneutics-kit/' | relative_url }})...
```

## Step 7: Canonical Threads & Representative Prompts

Use these to generate or categorize drafts:

### Authorship without an Author?
- "If training data and prompt-patterns stand in for an 'author,' what does intention even mean here?"
- "The author-function gets complicated when..."

### Organic vs. Mechanical Form (today)
- "Where does 'organic form' survive (or fail) in a world of generative constraints and templates?"
- "Romantic authenticity meets algorithmic generation..."

### Performativity & Parody in Models
- "When a model seems to 'perform' a genre, what counts as iteration vs. transformation?"
- "This AI text feels like parody, but parody of what?"

### Distanciation & Dialogue
- "What does 'dialogue' mean when outputs are decoupled from consciousness yet responsive to us?"
- "Traditional hermeneutics breaks down when..."

### Pedagogical Risk, Privacy, and Innovation
- "Which practices should remain private so that risky thinking can happen without sanctions?"
- "I'm trying a new approach to [problem], but I'm not ready to defend it yet..."

## Step 8: Workflow Process

### Daily Practice:
1. **Read/research** — engage with primary and secondary sources
2. **Note questions** — what puzzles or interests you?
3. **Draft quickly** — capture thinking while it's active
4. **Revise for clarity** — make accessible without losing complexity
5. **Post and iterate** — use reader feedback to develop ideas further

### Weekly Planning:
- **Monday**: Theoretical exploration
- **Tuesday**: Reading response  
- **Wednesday**: Methodological question
- **Thursday**: AI/hermeneutics reflection
- **Friday**: Open/miscellaneous

### Monthly Themes:
- Develop **recurring threads** across multiple posts
- **Build complexity** over time through linked explorations
- **Connect to course content** if you're teaching
- **Respond to current events** in academic/literary world

---

## Step 9: Quality Standards

### Content Quality:
- **Intellectual honesty** — admit uncertainty, acknowledge counterarguments
- **Accessible complexity** — sophisticated ideas in readable prose
- **Original thinking** — engage critically, don't just summarize
- **Scholarly engagement** — cite sources, join conversations

### Technical Quality:
- **Clear writing** — edit for clarity and flow
- **Proper citations** — academic integrity in all references
- **Jekyll formatting** — ensure markdown renders correctly
- **Link functionality** — test all internal and external links

---

## Step 10: The Densworld Addendum (REQUIRED)

Every post must end with an out-of-character **Densworld Addendum** (2–6 sentences) that speculates about a Densworld analogue for the post's idea. This is a **seed** for future development and remains **out-of-character** (a hand-off, not fiction).

### Choose Your Connection Path:
Your addendum should connect to **EITHER** the Archive collection **OR** the Debate collection, whichever seems more relevant to your post's concept:

#### Option A: Archive Connection
When your idea suggests a **concrete Densworld scene, document, or artifact**:
- A concrete Densworld image, device, practice, or scene your post suggests
- A **proposed Order** (Boundary; Doubling; Craving; Silence & Withdrawal; Violence & Secret Life; Mediation & Aperture)
- A **likely Region** (Capital; Dens/Densmok; Quarry; North/Northo; Tower/Sticks; Dead River; Capeast)

#### Option B: Debate Connection  
When your idea suggests an **institutional methodology question or archival policy**:
- A concrete archival policy problem or methodological question your post suggests
- A likely **Phase** (Phase I-IV of the archival system development)
- A likely **Document Type** (memo, minute, field report, hearing, counter-memo, directive, ruling, brief, case note, colloquy note)
- Which **Archivist Temperament** would likely author it (Clerkly, Romantic, Philosophical)

### Example Addenda:
```markdown
**Archive-focused:**
**Densworld Addendum (seed):** The "authenticity vs. performance" tension could surface in **North Town** as a murder-song requiring a masked **echoer** to confirm each line (→ **Doubling**). Archive entry might document testimonies about echoer-songs in the **North** region.

**Debate-focused:**  
**Densworld Addendum (seed):** The "authenticity vs. performance" question could prompt a **Phase III Hearing** where **Philosophical** archivists argue whether "performed authenticity" documents belong in **Doubling** or require a new sub-order. **Clerkly** temperament resists category multiplication.
```

## Step 11: Complete Example Post Structure

```markdown

layout: post
title: "The Problem with Romantic Sincerity"
post_number: 47
date: 2024-01-15 10:00:00 -0500
---

I've been working through the authenticity concept in my Romantic Quick Kit, 
but something keeps bothering me about how we usually think about sincerity...

[2-3 paragraphs exploring the problem]

This connects to a larger question about whether interpretation can ever 
be truly "authentic" to an author's intentions, especially when we're 
dealing with AI-generated texts...

[2-3 paragraphs developing the connection]

I don't have a clean answer yet, but I think the issue might be that 
we're using "sincerity" when we really mean something more like 
"systematic coherence"...

[Concluding thoughts, questions for further exploration]

**Densworld Addendum (seed):** The "authenticity vs. performance" tension could surface in **North Town** as a murder-song requiring a masked **echoer** to confirm each line (→ **Doubling**). A clerk in **Capital** proposes banning masked echoers in depositions (→ potential **Counter-Memo** in Debate).
```

This workflow maintains the **authentic academic voice** while systematically connecting each post to the broader site ecosystem through the Densworld seeding system.
