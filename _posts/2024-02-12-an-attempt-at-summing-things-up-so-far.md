This notebook has been an effort to trace a pattern I've been noticing: the arguments we have about AI are not new. They are an accelerated replay of a longstanding conflict over what it means to create and what it means to be human. This post is an attempt to synthesize that pattern with more rigor. The central thesis is this: the contemporary debate about AI is a reenactment of the 18th, 19th, and 20th-century intellectual battle between a Romantic worldview and (eventually) a Structuralist one.

Many current critiques of AI are almost entirely Romantic in their assumptions. Many responses, in turn, are fundamentally Structuralist and, more recently, computational.

### The Critique of AI as a Romantic Protest
From the beginning, I have been working to understand the deep-seated aversion many people feel toward AI, a feeling I confess I've [never shared](/post-4). Over time, it's become clear that this aversion is animated by a specific, inherited set of values. In ["Romantic Evil,"](/post-9) I tried to map the moral grammar of this worldview, identifying its core tenets: a defense of authenticity over imitation, of sincere interior life over mechanical repetition, and of personal communion over instrumentalism.

This is the Romantic trace that runs through the entire AI debate. When critics argue that AI art has no soul, they are making a Romantic claim. The latest version of this I've written about is the "AI is bullshit" argument I outlined in [Post 40](/post-40). Based on Harry Frankfurt's philosophy, this critique posits that AI's failure is moral: it generates language with no regard for truth. This lack of sincere, truth-oriented intention is a direct violation of the Romantic conscience. It is, in the vocabulary of my earlier posts, an act of ["inauthenticity."](/post-9)

This same basic set of Romantic ideas underpins nearly every other critique I've analyzed. It's present in the idea of AI causing ["Frustrated Ends,"](/post-11) where the machine performs the act of dialogue without the substance of a person, profaning the sacred "communion" of conversation. It's there in the charge of ["Imitative Negation,"](/post-12) which sees AI as a "simulation without a subject." It even animates the political critique that [AI is fascist](/post-20), an argument that relies on an aesthetic judgment of AI's output as "soulless" and "inhuman."

For the Romantics, this was expressed best in the figure of the artist or author. In my analysis of Walt Whitman's ["Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,"](/post-25) we see the ideal in its purest form: the author as a singular, embodied presence who transcends time to pour his authentic meaning into us. The pastor who refuses to use an AI for a sermon, as discussed in [Post 26](/post-26), is defending this same ideal: the belief that meaning must be authenticated by the personal struggle of the speaker. The entire anti-AI position is a defense of this belief in a sincere, unified human soul as the legitimate source of meaning.

### The Structuralist and Computational Response
The historical counter-argument to Romanticism was structuralism. As I sketched out in [Post 23](/post-23), thinkers like Ferdinand de Saussure shifted the object of analysis. They moved from the author's soul to the impersonal system of language. For Saussure, language (*langue*) is not an expression of individual feeling but a social product, a computational machine where meaning arises from the relational differences between signs. It is a system of form, not substance.

This is where the work of cognitive scientist Elan Barenholtz, which I began to explore in [Post 41](/post-41), adds an interesting layer. Barenholtz provides computational support for Saussure's theory. He argues that LLMs demonstrate that language is an "autogenerative" system that requires no grounding in sensory experience to function. It is an "autonomous informational system" whose rules are entirely internal to itself.

> ...language is its own beast. It's its own autonomous system. It can run on its own. That was the big realization. Large language models prove it...

This computational view doesn't just disagree with the "AI is bullshit" argument; it renders it irrelevant. The moral critique is based on the machine's intention (or lack thereof). The computational view shows that intention is not how the language system operates. To criticize an LLM for being "insincere" is to misunderstand the nature of the task. As Barenholtz suggests, the linguistic system is a separate module, a kind of "informational parasite" ([Post 36](/post-36)) that runs on our cognitive hardware but is not identical to our experiential self.

This perspective helps make sense of my own early intuitions on this blog. My rejection of originality and authenticity as necessary for art in [Post 6](/post-6) was an intuitive dismissal of the Romantic premise. My sense of a kinship between poetry and C++ in [Post 4](/post-4) was a recognition of their shared nature as formal, relational systems. Barenholtz and the structuralists provide the theoretical vote in favor of these intuitions.

### A Possible Thesis: AI as the Consummation of Technique
Here's a way to look at this conflict. The debate over AI is a proxy war between two fundamentally different models of what it means to be human: the Romantic model of the authentic soul and the Structuralist model of the human as a host for impersonal systems.

The structuralist argument is not just a theory; it describes a historical process. As I explored in my posts on Jacques Ellul ([31](/post-31), [32](/post-32)), the logic of *technique* (the drive to rationalize and standardize all human activity) has been replacing the personal with the systematic for centuries. The modern university syllabus, as I argued in [Post 29](/post-29), is a perfect example: a standardized machine for producing a predictable educational outcome, long before AI was a factor.

AI is not the alien invader that will destroy the authentic human world. It is the logical consummation of the technical, impersonal world we've already built. The "bullshit" critique is a protest against a process that has been underway for generations.

This brings us to a point I raised in [Post 28](/post-28): "Shakespeare winces not." The Romantic needs to believe that when we read, we are in communion with a living person. The computational view reveals this to be a persuasive illusion. The author is gone; only the linguistic system remains. The reason AI feels so unnerving is that it's the first time we've encountered a linguistic system where we cannot even pretend there is a person on the other end. It confronts us with the impersonal nature of system we use to think about our "selves."

This blog might be an attempt to move past the Romantic vocabulary that has defined and limited this debate. The task is not to save the real human self from the artificial machine. I'm trying to understand what it means that we've been building machines for millenia. And I'm tracking down claims that the machine (language itself) has been operating inside us all along.
