title: "The New Man Who \"Prefers Not To\" (Deleuze's Bartleby)"
post_number: 94

We begin with a story. A quiet, diligent law-copyist on Wall Street named Bartleby one day responds to a simple request from his boss with a simple phrase: "I would prefer not to." This refusal, repeated without explanation or emotion, expands until it consumes his work, his life, and the sanity of the office around him. He becomes a fixture, a ghost who has simply stopped participating. This figure of absolute refusal is the prototype test case for the ["Three Roads Forward"](/post-63). Is his an act of principled withdrawal (the Deep Opt-Out)? Or is it something else?

The philosopher Gilles Deleuze sees Bartleby's act not as a retreat but as a creative gesture. For him, the key is not Bartleby's psychology but his language. "I would prefer not to" is what Deleuze calls an "agrammatical formula." It isn't a simple "no." A "no" would be a choice within the existing system. The formula, instead, attacks the system itself. It carves out a "zone of indiscernibility" where the logic of choosing (of preferring one thing over another) collapses. It's a linguistic virus that renders the lawyer's world of commands and reasons inoperable.

By deploying this formula, Bartleby systematically dismantles the "paternal function" of the lawyer, who tries to manage him with authority, then kindness, then charity. Bartleby accepts none of it. He becomes, in Deleuze's terms, the "man without references," a figure who cannot be defined by his past, his job, or his relationships. He has escaped the old world's logic. He is an "Original," a new kind of man who functions as a pure potentiality, a blank slate.

This is why Deleuze's reading points toward a radical form of the "Deep Opt-In." Bartleby's act is not an escape from society but a necessary clearing of the ground for a new one. By erasing the old hierarchies, he makes possible a "society of brothers," a community built not on authority and filiation but on an alliance of singular, unclassifiable individuals. His refusal is not the end of the story, but the invention of a new way to begin it.
