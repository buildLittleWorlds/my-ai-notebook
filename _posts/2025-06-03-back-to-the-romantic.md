All that work I just did about evil makes me think I can just go back to the Romantics and think about what they thought. If I do that, I'll catch in the same net a lot of what everyone feels about AI. I do think there's a lot of gut-feeling stuff going on here.

I don't buy it though. So much of the fight against AI is about sincerity and authenticity and some notion of a human spark.

Why don't I buy that? Because we're not living in the 1800's anymore.

Pretty crazy, though. All it took to get philosophy tube to hold hands with the catholics was to serve up a solid shared villain: AI chatbots.
