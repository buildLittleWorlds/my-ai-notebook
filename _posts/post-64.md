I could be wrong. Obviously I don't know everyone, so I can't know how many people are like me on this one thing. And I don't literally mean "everyone." I know one or two people who agree with me on this.

That said, when it comes to public conversations out there on Youtube and the popular press, and when it comes to official pronouncements like policy guidelines and things like that, I am a complete outlier on this.

I am completely against this idea that seems common-sense for everyone else. I hate the idea that we should draw a clear line between things created by AI and things created by humans. I consider this a deeply wrongheaded invasion of the rights of authorship. As I see it, a fundamental power of every author is the hiddenness of their methods. I should not have to reveal how I made the thing I made in just the same way a magician should not have to reveal how they made their magic.

Immediately someone will reply. But the whole idea of the magician is a disclosure upfront that it's not real. We do require every magician to state at the outset, "Don't worry. This isn't real. It's a trick."

I'm against that too.

It's hard to track down the actual quote but there's anecdotal reporting that David Foster Wallace once said the following:

> I'm not that smart. I'm smart when I sit and think and have enough time; I'm not smart on the spot. I'm not smart when I'm scared. I'm not smart in front of five people with their eyes on me. But alone in a room â€” I can be a genius.

That's what I'm talking about. That's what I mean by the magic of an author. I shouldn't have to reveal any of my secrets about the muse I tap into when I go into that room and come back out with the written work. That's my business.
