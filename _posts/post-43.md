I saw a new video of Elan Barenholtz. He said something that crystallizes the computational/structuralist view of language I've been wrestling with. He calls it the ["dance of symbols."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NU9oASFXU&t=138s)

> ...the word cup can be just this abstract thing that just plays the role in the dance of symbols and nothing else.

This is it. This is the whole thing in three words. It's a great image because it captures quite a bit of the structuralist and even post-structuralist/deconstructive view of language I started sketching out in [Post 23](/post-23).

For Saussure, language is a system of pure difference. The meaning of a word doesn't come from it pointing to a "cup" out there in the world. It comes from its relationship to all the other words it isn't. The words are partners in a dance, each one defined by its movements relative to the others. The system is self-contained. The dance has its own internal logic.

But the phrase goes further, into Derrida's territory. A dance implies constant motion, play, and a lack of a fixed, grounding center. There is no master choreographer outside the dance, no "transcendental signified" that holds everything in place. There is only the endless interplay of the symbols themselves. The "dance of symbols" is language with no anchor, no "truth" outside the system to which it must refer. 

This is the world that LLMs operate in, and it's the world Barenholtz argues we operate in too, at least when we're using language. It's a system that can create infinite, intricate patterns without ever needing to touch the ground.

Yeats would call all of this an attempt to separate [the dancer from the dance](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43293/among-school-children).
