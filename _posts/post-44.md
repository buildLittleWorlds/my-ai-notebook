What I've been doing mostly is a kind of informal intellectual history. I've been noticing in arguments about AI on social media, Youtube, and random places a replaying of arguments from literary history. And I find this repetition really interesting. One thing it shows is that Romantic ideas of creativity and the self are still really strong. Even though many literary theorists and scholars would never claim to be Romantics 5 years or 10 years ago, this AI debate sort of calls their bluff and shows how widespread Romantic ideas are in popular culture and in academic reactions to AI.

What do I think about AI?

Mostly, I'm curious. I enjoy experimenting with LLM's, and I don't feel alienated from them or threatened by them. I'm not sure why. It could mean I don't share much of the Romantic worldview, but I probably have a lot of unexamined Romantic assumptions since it's looking like almost everyone does.

A more serious point I'd make is that people who are sympathetic to Foucault or Judith Butler, intellectuals with serious objections to the essentialist ideas of the Romantics, should start protesting a lot less about AI. If you've been on Foucault's side in a bunch of debates or if you nod along when you read *Gender Trouble*, then you probably need to nod along a little more often when you read what AI's got to say.
