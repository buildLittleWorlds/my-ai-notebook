Two things I reject as basic to art: originality and authenticity. My reasons are easy to state simply.

Originality - if art has to be original in order to count as art, then almst nobody makes art because almost nothing is actually original.

Authenticity - if authenticity is the measure of art, then the personal diary of a 13 or 14-year old working out their feelings is the highest form of art.
