This is from something called "The Book of the Words of Righteousness" in *The Book of Enoch*. It's God speaking to Enoch about the fate of the Watchers but also about the nature of their offspring, the giants.

> And now, the giants, who are produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling. Evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from men and from the Watchers is their beginning and primal origin; they shall be evil spirits on earth, and evil spirits shall they be called. And the spirits of the giants afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destruction on the earth, and cause trouble.

There's a permeability here I want to find out about. First, the boundary between "spirit" and "flesh" is broken to create the giants. Then, when the giants die, their own spirits are unleashed. So now the human world is permanently open to these spirits' ability to "afflict, oppress, destroy, attack."
