What I've got here is what I'll call my Romantic account of evil. It's my own thoughts based on watching [Isaiah Berlin's lectures on Romanticism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk2UetWsO-M&t=2s). My goal is to clarify what a Romantic might think of as evil even if they wouldn't use that word.

### Romantic Evil
**Definition:** Evil is any betrayal of vocation and sincerity. A refusal of the singular call that gives a life its shape. It is the willing exchange of destiny for comfort, of tragic seriousness for safety, of living speech for empty forms.

### Marks of Evil
- **Inauthenticity:** bad faith, selling out, self-betrayal; speaking words one does not inhabit.
- **Levelling:** the flattening of irreducible difference into averages, norms, and interchangeable roles.
- **Profaned Communion:** "togetherness" without persons. Kitsch intimacy that avoids risk and responsibility.
- **Cowardice:** fear of the sublime risk where something worth dying for is at stake; preference for the tepid middle.
- **Instrumentalism:** treating others (and language) as means, not as free centers that answer and demand answer.
- **Mechanical Repetition:** the erosion of meaning by rote forms that no longer reveal an interior life.
- **The Antiâ€‘Sublime:** a world without tragedy because nothing ultimate is affirmed. No call, no pledge, no vow.

### Moral Center
Goodness is integrity. Commitment to one's call; fidelity under risk; conversation that meets a person as a person; and a willingness to suffer the tragic costs of living in truth. The Romantic conscience prizes the singular, the vowed, and the answerable over comfort, utility, and faceless universals.
