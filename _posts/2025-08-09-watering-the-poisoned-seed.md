The pragmatic objection, outlined in the [last post](/post-80), is a really important challenge. And it's probably got a lot of truth to it. It argues that modern audiences have a de-mythologized view of art as an industrial product, and that boycotts are simply targeted economic actions against a brand. While it is true that art is produced collaboratively and operates within a market, this view fails to think in a careful way about the logic of our engagement with it. Even in a mechanical age, we seem unable to shake the hunt for a singular, unifying vision.

This is where the Romantic concept of the [*Keimentschluß*, or "seminal decision,"](/post-75) reasserts its power. We may know that a film is the product of a thousand technicians, but we still speak of "a Christopher Nolan film." We attribute the success or failure of a television series to its "showrunner." The logic of our criticism and consumption still attempts an organizing principle, a singular consciousness from which the work's unifying vision unfolds. We still search, in other words, for *the* origin.

The Romantic insists that this is not just a convenient shorthand. It is a recognition that a successful work of art feels [organic](/romantic-kit-organic-form), not like a "mechanical assembly of discrete, interchangeable parts." When we boycott a film because of its director, we are not just targeting a CEO; we are rejecting the work's principle of life, its generative soul.

This organic model is precisely what makes the idea of "economic contamination" so coherent and potent. If the artwork were merely an industrial product, then purchasing it would be a morally neutral transaction. But if it is the living incarnation of its creator's *Keimentschluß*, then the economic act becomes one of profound moral significance. To pay for the art is to "water the poisoned seed." The money is transformed into the lifeblood that sustains a particular spiritual orientation in the world. The complicity is not merely economic; it is spiritual, a direct nourishing of a corrupt generative source. The pragmatic objection fails because it underestimates the enduring power of the organic model of authorship it claims we have outgrown.
