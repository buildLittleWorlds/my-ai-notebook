After sixty-odd posts, you start to see patterns. This whole project has been an attempt to map a strange territory, to figure out why a technology like AI can feel so alien and pretty familiar at the same time. The arguments against it are often a replay of [Romantic anxieties](/post-9) about sincerity and soul. The arguments for it often rely on a [computational view of language](/post-41) that sees us as hosts for impersonal systems. It feels like we're stuck between two inherited worldviews, neither of which feels completely right.

Maybe it's time to zoom out. Forget the specific arguments for a minute and ask a simpler question: What is the right way to live with this thing? How do we orient ourselves to a technology that seems poised to reshape our world? It seems to me there are three possible stances we could take.

### 1. The Deep Opt-Out

This is the most intellectually honest form of protest. This position looks at AI and sees not just a new tool, but the final, perfect expression of a system that has been quietly replacing the human for centuries. It's the realization that the soulless, efficient, rationalizing logic of the machine didn't begin with LLMs. It began with the first bureaucracies, the first factories, the first attempts to render the world calculable and predictable.

From this perspective, to protest AI is to protest the entire modern project. It's a recognition that you can't coherently rage against ChatGPT on a smartphone you bought on a global supply chain after it was marketed to you by an algorithm. That's a profound hypocrisy. The deep opt-out requires a radical consistency. It means seeing the ["Romantic trace"](/post-21) not as a feeling to be defended, but as an after-image of some sort of a world we have already lost. The only authentic response is to reject the whole apparatus. It's a lonely, difficult, and perhaps impossible road, but it has the virtue of seeing the problem in its true scale.

### 2. Skate Along the Surface

This is the pragmatic, "don't get so worked up" approach. It looks at the breathless hype from both sides, the messianic claims of the AI boosters and the apocalyptic warnings of the critics, and rolls its eyes. It remembers a thousand other "next big things" that were supposed to change everything and didn't, or at least not in the ways anyone predicted. The Y2K bug, the Segway, the Metaverse. The world just keeps going.

This stance is a kind of strategic indifference. It argues that the best way to deal with the noise is to ignore it. Just do your work, use the tools that are useful, discard the ones that aren't, and refuse to get pulled into the dramatic hyperventilating. It suspects that both the utopian promises and the soul-stealing fears are mostly marketing from corporations that benefit from making us feel like history is ending. It's not cynical. It suggests we keep our heads down and wait for the fever to break.

### 3. The Deep Opt-In

This is a refusal to see technology as something alien or anti-human to begin with. It starts from the premise that to be human *is* to be technological. From the first sharpened stone to the first controlled fire, we have always been tool-makers. Our nature is to augment ourselves, to build systems that extend our reach and reshape our world. This has never been a safe or simple process.

Every major innovation has carried with it the twin possibilities of progress and destruction. The printing press spread both enlightenment and propaganda. Nuclear fission promised clean energy and delivered the bomb. This is just the human condition. This stance argues that opting out is not a real option; it's an abdication of responsibility. The only way forward is to renew our commitment to the messy, dangerous, and hopeful project of being human-plus-technology. It means engaging with AI not as an external threat, but as the next stage of our own evolution, with all the risks and responsibilities that entails. We have to participate, steer, and build the future, because the one thing we can't do is stop it from arriving.

I don't know which road is the right one. Maybe they're not mutually exclusive. I spend a lot of time trying to figure out which direction I'm pointed in.
