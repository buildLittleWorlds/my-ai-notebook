The "AI is fascist" thing doesn't work. Maybe it used to. But it's recycled material now.

I worked out my own definition of [what I called "Romantic Evil."](/post-9) I was trying to pin down what animates one kind of opposition to AI. The marks of it looked something like this:

> **Inauthenticity:** bad faith, selling out, self-betrayal; speaking words one does not inhabit.  
> **Profaned Communion:** "togetherness" without persons. Kitsch intimacy that avoids risk and responsibility.  
> **Instrumentalism:** treating others (and language) as means, not as free centers that answer and demand answer.  
> **Mechanical Repetition:** the erosion of meaning by rote forms that no longer reveal an interior life.

This is obviously the same vocabulary used to attack AI. The whole argument is that AI art is evil because it's *inauthentic* (made by a machine, not a person), *instrumental* (a tool for power and profit), and results in a *profaned communion* (art without a soul).

I already [summed this up before](/post-13). The anxieties about AI as fascist are the same old Romantic anxieties. The problem isn't that the feelings aren't real. The problem is the diagnosis is a hundred years out of date. Or two hundred years.

We're trying to understand a new kind of machine with concepts we've inherited from pretty far back.

This doesn't mean it's not worth thinking through. That's what the rest of the blog is for. It just means I'm not willing to copy/paste the Romantic ideas without updating for what's happening now.
