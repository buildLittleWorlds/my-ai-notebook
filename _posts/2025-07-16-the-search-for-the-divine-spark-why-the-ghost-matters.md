A purely systematic analysis of AI looking only at datasets and algorithms feels incomplete. The Romantic method, with its insistence on a **double vision**, seems like a richer path. It demands we analyze both the **grammatical rail** (the system) and the **psychological rail** (the singular practice).

But we must remember *why* the Romantics insisted on this second rail. It wasn't naive optimism. For Schleiermacher, the "psychological rail" was a necessary discipline to bridge the vast gap between two human minds.¹ For a visionary like William Blake, the artist's psychology was the vessel for something even greater: the divine imagination. The author was a conduit for a spiritual reality. The search for the "living presence" in the text was a search for God.

### The Necessary Second Rail

When we analyze an AI text, the grammatical rail is real. There *is* a system. But the psychological rail, the search for a singular, visionary "voice," has no corresponding reality. And more importantly, the spiritual quest to find communion with another soul touched by the divine is impossible. There is no soul in the machine.

A modern critic might call this a "hermeneutic blind spot." But for a Romantic, it is the entire point. Their method is not a neutral analytical tool; it is a spiritual discipline. It is *designed* to discover a human and divine presence. Its failure to find one in an AI text is not a failure of the method, but a successful diagnosis of the machine's profane nature.

### The Critical Pivot: The Method is a Moral Compass

The Romantic method doesn't have a "blind spot"; it has a conviction. Its foundational bias is that meaningful language comes from a soul. A text produced by a machine with no consciousness is, from this perspective, not a new kind of text, but a desecration. It is the logic of the "Mechanical Age" made manifest, an artifact of what Carlyle called a world that has "lost its belief in the Invisible."²

By insisting on the "psychological rail," the Romantic interpreter is not making a mistake. They are using their hermeneutic system as a moral compass. The compass needle spins wildly when pointed at AI, not because the compass is broken, but because it can find no true north. It finds only a radical, inhuman emptiness where a soul ought to be.
