The [last post](/post-61) introduced Paul Ricoeur's core idea: modern interpretation is a "conflict" between a hermeneutics of suspicion and a hermeneutics of recollection. This isn't just an abstract theory; it provides the foundation for a practical, step-by-step method for engaging with AI-generated texts and chat. This method moves us beyond simple reactions ("Is it authentic? Is it bullshit?") and into the rigorous work of interpretation.

The method is a conscious, dialectical movement between two poles. Ricoeur calls this a movement between an *archeology* (a regressive analysis of a text's origins) and a *teleology* (a progressive analysis of the meaning it makes possible).

### Step 1: The Archeological Analysis (The School of Suspicion)

You must begin with a reductive, demystifying reading. This is the analysis of the AI text as a *mechanism*. The core question is: "Where does this text come from?" This is an act of suspicion. You are treating the text's fluent surface as a mask that conceals the non-human, statistical processes that generated it.

#### Key Questions for the Archeological Reading:

- **What are the traces of the training data?** Look for the seams. Can you identify specific clichés, ideological biases, or linguistic tics that point back to the vast, impersonal corpus of text the model was trained on? This is the equivalent of a Freudian analysis of the "archaic heritage" that speaks through the individual.
- **How is the text a function of the prompt?** Analyze your own prompt with suspicion. How did your word choices, your constraints, and your unstated assumptions pre-determine the output? The text is, in part, a mirror reflecting your own input back at you.
- **Where are the "symptoms" of the machine?** Identify the moments where the text reveals its non-human nature. This could be a "hallucination" (a factual error), a moment of nonsensical "word salad," or a strange, inhuman metaphor. These are not just flaws; they are crucial data about the nature of the machine's "thought." Ricoeur would call this the text's "energetics" and "economics." The raw, efficient process that underlies the apparent meaning.
- **What is being concealed?** The primary thing being concealed is the AI's profound indifference to truth and meaning. Your task is to identify how the text uses plausible language to mask this fundamental emptiness. This is the core of the "bullshit" critique, and it belongs firmly in the archeological stage.

This first step is crucial. It grounds your interpretation in the material reality of the technology and prevents you from naively anthropomorphizing the AI. It is an act of critical distance.

### Step 2: The Teleological Analysis (The School of Recollection)

Having established your critical distance, you must now pivot. You temporarily suspend your suspicion and treat the text not as a symptom of a machine, but as a *symbol* that addresses you, the interpreter. The core question is: "Where is this text going? What new meaning does it make possible *for me*?"

#### Key Questions for the Teleological Reading:

- **What thought does this text "give rise to"?** This is Ricoeur's key phrase. Even in its flaws, does the AI's output spark a new idea? Does a strange juxtaposition of concepts force you to see your own topic in a new light? This "surplus of meaning" is not in the AI; it is a product of your interaction with the text.
- **What latent cultural logic does it reveal?** The AI, in its unthinking recombination of linguistic patterns, can function as an instrument for revealing the hidden myths and metaphors of our culture. When an AI writes about business using the language of warfare, for example, it is revealing a deep structural metaphor in our collective "textual unconscious."
- **How does it advance my own "process of becoming conscious"?** In a chat interaction, the goal is not to get a perfect answer. The goal is to use the AI's responses as a tool to refine your own questions. Each inadequate or flawed response forces you to become more precise, more aware of your own assumptions. The AI becomes a catalyst for your own self-understanding.

This second step makes you the active and responsible center of interpretation. The meaning is not a pre-existing thing to be discovered in the AI, but a new thing to be created through your dialectical engagement with its output.

### Step 3: The Dialectical Movement in Practice

The real art of this hermeneutic method is not to choose one reading over the other, but to move fluidly between them. The tension is the point. For example:

1. Start with *archeology*: "This AI-generated poem is just a cliché-ridden product of its training data, [a blurry jpeg](/post-37) of a thousand other poems."
2. Discover a *teleological* possibility: "But the strange way it combined a technological metaphor with a natural one is something I've never seen before. That gives me a new idea."
3. Circle back to *archeology*: "This new idea wasn't 'created' by the AI, but was an accidental byproduct of its non-human, statistical method of combining words, a method a human writer, constrained by convention, might never have tried."
4. Arrive at a *dialectical synthesis*: "The AI text, a product of a non-conscious, 'archaic' linguistic process, has become the occasion for a forward-looking, 'teleological' expansion of my own creative consciousness."

By using this Ricoeurian pov-system, you move beyond the simplistic and unanswerable question, "Does the AI *mean* what it 'says'?" and begin to engage with the far more productive and philosophically rich question, "What can be meant *through* it?" You treat the AI not as a fraudulent author, but as an eloquent and deeply ambiguous cultural symbol that, above all, gives rise to thought.
