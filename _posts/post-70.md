title: "The Parasite in the Machine: A Lacanian Reading of Elan Barenholtz"

So I've been mapping a conflict in this notebook. Our collective anxiety over AI, I've argued, is a new playing-out of an intellectual battle between a Romantic worldview, which prizes the authentic, unified soul, and a structuralist worldview, which sees us as hosts for impersonal systems. This may not be just a battle between two theories. The impersonal system may be something we can now observe directly.

The work of cognitive scientist Elan Barenholtz adds a concrete, 21st-century update to this debate. His analysis of LLMs has led him to the "uncomfortable realization" that language is an autonomous, "parasitic" system inside our heads, creating a profound split between the "speaking me" and the "feeling me".

This seems like a brand new thing, and Barenholtz talks about it like it's a brand new thing. But it's actually an independent (possible) confirmation of a theory developed a while ago during fights about the nature of psychoanalysis. For the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, Barenholtz's "uncomfortable realization" wouldn't count as a new discovery prompted by AI. It's the fundamental, unavoidable starting point of what it means to be a human subject.

### The "Problematic I" and Lacan's Split Subject

Barenholtz, by taking the logic of LLMs seriously, arrives at a moment of philosophical realization. He sees that if language is a self-contained system running on our cognitive hardware, then the foundation of our sense of self becomes more complex than we typically assume. The unified "I" reveals itself as a set of distinct, and perhaps disconnected, functions.

> *"...the word 'I' suddenly becomes problematic [...] and all of that immediately [...] gets very hairy sort of philosophically... you suddenly get into these weird dualities"* [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9QWvmrWPZE&t=724s)

This "hairy" philosophical problem is exactly where Lacan starts. In his essay "On the Subject who Is Finally in Question," he attacks the "mirage of the 'completeness of the subject'" as a fantasy. For Lacan, the subject isn't a unified thing. We are all fundamentally split the moment we learn to speak.

The "I" *is* problematic because the "I" who is speaking is never the same person as the "I" being described. This isn't a bug; it's just a fact of the human situation. It's a direct challenge to the whole [Romantic worldview](/romantic-quick-kit) I've been tracking, which needs to believe in a single, unified soul pouring its meaning out. Lacan gives a formal structure to Barenholtz's "weird dualities," showing that the ghost in the machine isn't a new problem.

### The "Collective System" and the Discourse of the Other

Barenholtz pushes his insight further when he realizes that this autonomous language system doesn't truly belong to him. It is a shared, social inheritance.

> *"...my feelings are my own... but ideas Concepts all of these things that are the lifeblood of language they don't actually belong to my brain they don't belong to my body they belong to some collective system some informational system that is larger than me"* [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIMw04GJJ7U&t=1059s)

This is a perfect description of something Lacan has his own theory of. The "collective system" that Barenholtz identifies is, in Lacanian terms, the Symbolic Order, the pre-existing treasury of words, laws, and cultural structures that we are all born into. As Lacan formulates it, "the unconscious is the discourse of the Other". Our thoughts don't actually belong to our brain because we can only think with the words and concepts given to us by the Other. Lacan provides the theory for the "informational organism" Barenholtz senses living outside of him (while also somehow being inside of him).

### The "Magic" of Language and the Itinerary of the Signifier

Maybe the weirdest thing we've learned from LLMs is that true intelligence seems to just fall out of a good enough communication engine. Barenholtz puts it perfectly:

> *"...the thinking machine. Wow. That's the magic part. And it turns out no like actually just make the communications engine and the ability to play chess and write computer programs and solve logic will just fall out of that"* [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9QWvmrWPZE&t=724s)

This "magic" is the trick Lacan explains in his "Seminar on 'The Purloined Letter.'" He gives us a blueprint for how it works. The whole drama of Poe's story (the power plays, the acts of blindness and genius) is generated not by the characters' inner minds, but by the movement of a "pure signifier": the letter itself. Its content doesn't matter. What matters is its itinerary, its path through the system.

The "intelligence" that writes a program or plays chess "falls out" of the system because the system itself (the signifying chain) is what produces these effects. The characters in the story don't need to be smart; they just need to occupy their assigned place in the structure the letter creates for them. Lacan's analysis is an alredy-existing model (whether it happens to be empirically true or not) for how an impersonal system can generate results that look and feel like "thought."

Barenholtz's claims about cognitive psychology come from observing 21st-century technology. He's putting ideas out there that resemble the core principles Lacan was developing decades earlier by reading Freud. What Lacan's work describes is an "alien intelligence" or "informational parasite" we now see in AI. The theories might be wrong. But they sound really similar, which is fascinating.
