The idea (from my [last post](/post-26)) of a pastor using AI to generate a sermon feels like a deep violation, a kind of sacrilege. But is this feeling grounded in Christian tradition or even in scripture itself? Is it rooted in the ancient foundations of the faith? Or is it a more recent development? History might provide an answer in the form of a kind of technology for sermon production: *the postil*.

A postil was a collection of pre-written sermons, organized according to the church year's scriptural readings (the pericopes). Before the Reformation and for centuries after, these books were a staple of clerical life. They were practical tools for a vital task. Some collections even bore titles like *Dormi secure* ("Sleep Well!") a frank acknowledgment of their purpose: to provide a ready-made sermon for an overworked or under-trained priest so he could sleep without worry. It was a technology designed to solve a problem of production and quality control.

Thinking of it this way, the postil functioned as a kind of 16th-century generative model, a proto-AI for the pulpit. The analogy is surprisingly robust:

- **The Prompt:** The assigned Gospel or Epistle reading for a given Sunday served as the pastor's prompt.
- **The Model:** The postil itself, often written by a theological master like Martin Luther, was the large, pre-trained model.
- **The Generation:** The output was a complete, structured, and doctrinally sound sermon on the prompted text.
- **The System Guardrails:** Luther considered his own *Church Postil* one of his most important works. Its purpose was explicitly to embed his theology of justification and the Law/Gospel distinction into the weekly proclamation of the church, acting as a kind of system prompt to ensure orthodox output.

So if the function was so similar, why is one seen as a pious tool and the other as a sacrilegious cheat? The difference is not in the technology, but in the perceived identity of the author. The postil was created for a world that understood the pastor's primary role to be that of a herald. A herald's virtue is not originality or sincerity, but fidelity to the message he carries. His authority comes not from his own inner struggle or unique insight, but from the king who sent him. For a 16th-century pastor, reading a sermon from Luther's postil wasn't inauthentic; it was a humble and wise act of leveraging the authority of a master herald to ensure the King's message was delivered with maximum clarity and force.

We no longer live in that world. As the last post argued, we have replaced the pastor-as-herald with the [pastor-as-Romantic-author](/post-26). We now demand that the sermon be a work of ["sincerity"](/post-9) and "living speech," born from the pastor's own unique, interior struggle. The authority, we feel, must be authenticated by the personal and emotional investment of the individual soul. The postil system, which privileged the objective message over the subjective messenger, feels alien to us.

The history of the postil serves as a historical control group for our feelings about AI. It proves that the modern rejection of machine-assisted writing in sacred contexts is not a timeless theological absolute. It is the product of a profound and relatively recent shift in our culture's idea of what an author is and what gives a text its soul. Before we could fear the machine, we first had to inherit the notion of authentic authorship we now fear the machine lacks.
