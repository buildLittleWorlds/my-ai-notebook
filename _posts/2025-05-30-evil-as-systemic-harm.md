Here's a general account of evil as I find it in Philosophy Tube's ["AI is an Ethical Nightmare."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaU6tI2pb3M&t=1s) As a test, I then apply it to AI.

### Definition
**Evil = systemic harm inflicted by opaque power.** Evil names arrangements that concentrate power, hide how decisions are made, project false meanings onto bodies, externalize environmental costs, and deskill or atomize labor. All of which denies people material safety, agency, and recourse.

### Features
- **Opacity:** black‑box systems that deny meaningful explanation and remedy.
- **Projection:** technologies that impose categories onto people (e.g., gender/race) and treat those labels as truths.
- **Extraction:** flattening living labor into "data," and treating that as ownerless raw material.
- **Externalities:** shifting real ecological and social costs onto the public while privatizing benefits.
- **Ideology:** hype and marketing that pre‑empt democratic debate and accountability.

### Why AI Is Evil
- **Fair‑washing & black boxes:** inscrutable models + surrogate "explanations" launder biased outcomes.
- **Digital epidermalization:** face/gender recognition that assigns meaning to your body and can enable humiliation and harm.
- **Data flattening:** scraping human work and images without consent; remixing them as "content."
- **Sub‑employment:** globally distributed, surveilled microwork that pays little and offers no power or recourse.
- **Dirty material base:** mining, energy use, and supply chains packaged as "clean."

### Moral Center
Goodness here is democratic control over the material conditions of life: worker power, transparent and contestable decisions, consent‑respecting data practices, and ecological limits.
