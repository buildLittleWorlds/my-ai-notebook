title: "Harari's AI Future (Part 1)"

Browse around for stuff about AI, and you'll run into Yuval Noah Harari. He wrote *Sapiens* and some other books. A lot of people care about what he says. I've never gotten into him but he's got intellectual influence. He's also pretty obsessed with AI. He did an interview on the Rich Roll podcast, which I know nothing about but which popped up for me. So here's his vision of how AI could ["Quietly Control the Minds of Billions."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-e246GRuec)

His argument is the real danger isn't a Hollywood robot rebellion but something more subtle. As I've been doing, I read the podcast through the lens of Ellul and *Propaganda*. Ellul would agree with Harari's starting point but then take apart the idea that any of this is new. For Ellul, AI isn't the beginning of a new kind of control; it's the system that's been in place for a really long time.

Here's a list.

### 1. On the Nature of the Threat
> **Harari:** "...we've seen the Hollywood science fiction scenarios of the big robot rebellion... this is extremely unlikely to happen anytime soon... the danger doesn't come from the big robot rebellion it comes from the AI bureaucracies."

**Ellul's Critique: Agreement.** Ellul starts his own analysis by dismissing the outdated idea of propaganda as composed of "lies and 'tall stories.'" For Ellul, modern propaganda is not a crude tool but a pervasive environment. So he would agree. The threat is not violence but a quiet, systematic integration of control into the bureaucratic and social fabric. This is the only point where their analyses line up.

### 2. On the Opaque Decision-Maker
> **Harari:** "...if they tell you we decided not to give you a loan and you ask the bank why not and the bank says we don't know. I mean [the] computer says no. I mean the algorithm says no. We don't understand why..."

**Ellul's Critique: This isn't new; it's the essence of [*technique*](https://ellul.org/themes/ellul-and-technique/).** For Harari, this is a frightening new development. It's the arrival of an "alien intelligence." Ellul would argue it's the final stage of the technological society. The goal of technique is always to find the single most efficient method, a method that is necessarily inhuman and has no need for human-scale explanations. The opaque algorithm is the perfect functionary. The system is not becoming "alien"; it is simply becoming what it was always meant to be: a self-justifying, rationalized process where human intuition and understanding have been engineered out. Modern propaganda is scientific. It "tends to establish a set of rules, rigorous, precise, and tested, that are not merely recipes but impose themselves on every propagandist." Harari seems surprised: "The computer says no." But that's how systems work. The system says yes or no. That's what it's built to do.

### 3. On the "Non-Human Culture"
> **Harari:** "...this is the first time that we are basically about to enter a nonhuman culture... Now there is an alien intelligence, a nonhuman intelligence that will increasingly produce songs and music, mythology, financial strategies, political ideas."

**Ellul's Critique: This is not new; it is total propaganda.** Harari sees AI as the creator of a new alien culture. Ellul would see AI as the most efficient instrument for perfecting the existing system of what he calls "Total Propaganda." The goal has always been to create a closed, all-encompassing environment for the individual. Propaganda "tries to surround man by all possible routes... It furnishes him with a complete system for explaining the world, and provides immediate incentives to action. We are here in the presence of an organized myth that tries to take hold of the entire person." The "non-human" culture was already being built by the mass media, which created a self-referential world of news and entertainment. AI is not inventing this world; it is simply automating its production and sealing off the exits.

### 4. On the Weaponization of Intimacy
> **Harari:** "Intimacy is like the ultimate weapon... with AIs, it is possible technically to mass-produce intimacy. You can create all these AIs that will interact with us... it could be used to manipulate us like like never before."

**Ellul's Critique: This is not a weapon forced upon a victim; it is a product created to meet a desperate need.** So Harari sees the individual as a passive target. Ellul argues that the modern individual *needs* propaganda more than the state needs to impose it. Having been uprooted from traditional communities, the individual in mass society is isolated, anxious, and powerless. The individual craves connection and justification. Ellul writes: "Cast out of the disintegrating microgroups of the past, such as family, church, or village, the individual is plunged into mass society... his isolation, his loneliness, his ineffectuality. Propaganda then hands him in veritable abundance what he needs: a raison d'Ãªtre, personal involvement and participation in important events, an outlet and excuse..." AI's "mass-produced intimacy" is not a weapon being aimed at us. It's more like this. As the air of technology becomes harder to breathe with human lungs, propaganda is the stuff we actively work to create so we can breathe the new air.

For Ellul, Harari's frightening future is simply a description of the project we've been working on since about the 1600's. It's reaching its logical conclusion.

But looking back over this, I see Harari using words like "consciousness," "feelings," and "intimacy." He worries AI, which has "zero consciousness," will mimic these things. This is all really familiar for my blog. It's the language of the [Romantic worldview](/post-9) I trying to circle back to. That's what I'll do in Part 2.
