In the [last post](/post-89), I laid out a principled defense of the "deep opt-out," drawing on David Oderberg's arguments for freedom of conscience and dissociation. Oderberg makes the case for the right of individuals and groups to withdraw from activities that violate their core beliefs. But there is a counter-argument. It insists on a kind of "deep opt-in" to the shared life of a pluralistic society. This view argues that some exposure to difference is not just permissible, but necessary for citizenship itself.

The stakes of this conflict are incredibly high. As Nomi Maya Stolzenberg has shown in her work on the famous [*Mozert v. Hawkins*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozert_v._Hawkins) case, for insular religious communities, the "mere exposure" to diverse viewpoints in public schools is not a neutral act of education. It is perceived as a form of assimilation and indoctrination, a direct threat to their cultural survival. This is why the debate isn't just about hurt feelings; it's about a fundamental clash between two different views of what a society owes its citizens and what its citizens owe in return.

Stephen Macedo, in his essay "Liberal Civic Education and Religious Fundamentalism," makes the case for the "deep opt-in" with direct force. He argues that in a liberal democracy, the right to opt out has its limits, especially when the education of future citizens is at stake.

> As a matter of basic principle at least, we have good reason to refuse the *Mozert* families' request to opt out. If intransigence here appears to be at odds with religious freedom, it must be remembered that rightful liberty is civil liberty, or liberty that can be guaranteed equally to all. All of us must accept limits on our liberty designed to sustain a system of equal liberty for all. Each of us can reasonably be asked to surrender some control over our own children for the sake of reasonable common efforts to insure that all future citizens learn the minimal prerequisites of citizenship. There is no right to be exempted from measures reasonably designed to help secure the freedom of all.

This is the core of the "deep opt-in" argument. Macedo is asserting that membership in a free society comes with a price. That price is the acceptance of "reasonable common efforts" to teach the "minimal prerequisites of citizenship," chief among them being tolerance for diversity. From this perspective, allowing a group to completely shield its children from different ways of life is not a protection of their liberty, but a threat to the liberty of all. It undermines the conditions that make a pluralistic society possible. For Macedo, the freedom of the individual conscience cannot be used as a veto against the shared project of creating citizens.
