title: "Sleep Well! The Unconscious Arrogance of Medieval Sermon Technology"

Imagine walking into a medieval bookstore and finding a sermon collection titled *Dormi secure* (literally, "Sleep Well!") This wasn't false advertising or wishful thinking. It was a frank acknowledgment of purpose: here was a book of ready-made sermons designed specifically so that "an overworked or under-trained priest" could "sleep without worry" on Saturday night. Sunday's sermon was handled. No struggle required.

I mentioned this detail in passing in my [earlier post](/post-27) about medieval postils, but it deserves its own meditation. The title "Sleep Well!" reveals something startling about medieval attitudes toward sermon production and something pretty revealing about our modern ones. Medieval Christians were comfortable with a technology that explicitly promised to eliminate pastoral anxiety about preaching. We are not.

The unconscious arrogance of *Dormi secure* is breathtaking when you think about it. The Church was frankly admitting that many of its priests were either too busy or too incompetent to prepare their own sermons. The solution wasn't better training or lighter workloads. It was a book that would let them sleep soundly while still delivering quality Sunday content. The message to the struggling priest was clear: your personal contribution to this week's sermon is not essential. What matters is that the Word gets preached, not who authored the words.

This is precisely the argument that AI sermon proponents make today, yet it feels like sacrilege to us in a way it apparently did not to our medieval predecessors. Why? The difference isn't theological. It's cultural. Somewhere between the medieval period and now, we absorbed the Romantic idea that authentic work must emerge from authentic personal struggle. We inherited the notion that a sermon's value depends not just on its content but on the [pastor's sincere wrestling](/post-26) with the text. The medieval Church clearly operated under different assumptions.

Consider what the "Sleep Well!" title tells us about medieval expectations. The priest's Saturday night rest was not seen as laziness but as practical wisdom. Why should every village priest reinvent the theological wheel when master theologians had already done the work? Why should the faithful suffer through amateur hour when professional-grade sermons were available in print? The postil system prioritized the congregation's need for solid teaching over the pastor's need for creative expression.

This utilitarian approach to preaching feels almost alien to modern sensibilities. We expect our pastors to be Romantic authors, pouring their souls onto the page each week. We want to feel their personal investment, their individual struggle with the text. A pastor who simply read a medieval "Sleep Well!" sermon would feel like a fraud to us, even if the sermon was superior to anything he could have written himself. We have convinced ourselves that authenticity requires personal authorship.

But the medieval Church's comfort with "Sleep Well!" sermons suggests that this equation of authenticity with individual authorship is not a theological necessity. It's a cultural preference we've absorbed from Romanticism. The unconscious arrogance of *Dormi secure* was not in its disregard for the pastor's soul but in its frank admission of what the system already knew: not everyone is called to be an original theologian, and that's perfectly fine.

Perhaps our modern anxiety about AI sermons reveals something about us rather than about the technology. We may be more invested in the drama of pastoral struggle than in the effectiveness of pastoral teaching. The medieval Church was willing to let priests "sleep well" if it meant the flock was fed well. We seem to prefer our shepherds sleep-deprived and stressed, as long as their exhaustion proves their authenticity.
