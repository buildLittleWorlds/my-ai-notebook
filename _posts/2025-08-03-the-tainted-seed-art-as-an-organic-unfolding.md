If an artist's inner state (*Gefühl*) is the true source of art, how does it become an actual poem, painting, or film? The Romantics needed a model of creation that could preserve the sacred link between the creator's soul and the finished work. They found it in nature. Their answer was the theory of [organic form](/romantic-kit-organic-form), a counter-metaphor to the soulless logic of [the machine](/romantic-kit-technology-machine).

The theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher provided one of the most rigorous concepts for this process: the [*Keimentschluß*](/romantic-kit-glossary), or "seminal decision." This is not a mere plan or outline. It is the originating, unifying impulse of a work, the catalytic moment where the artist's foundational *Gefühl* fuses with a specific, guiding intention. It is the "seed" from which the entire work is destined to grow.

This model recasts the entire creative act. An artist is not a builder assembling pre-fabricated parts according to an external blueprint. An artist is more like a gardener cultivating a unique form of life. The artwork is not constructed; it unfolds organically from its generative seed. Every word, every brushstroke of the work is intrinsically connected to the whole because it is a necessary expression of that singular, originating impulse. Authenticity from this point of view is a measure of the unbroken connection between the seed and the fruit.

This polemical opposition between the organic and the mechanical was a core part of the Romantic project. We see it in our own time when we demand that a pastor's sermon be the product of a sincere, personal struggle, as I discussed in [Post 26](/post-26). We expect it to be the organic unfolding of their wrestling with the text, not a mechanical assembly of theological talking points.

The concept of the *Keimentschluß* gives this instinct a philosophical backbone. And it provides the crucial logic for the idea of aesthetic contamination. If a work of art is the living incarnation of its creator's seminal decision, then an artist in a state of moral corruption (hate or abuse) cannot produce a pure work. The originating impulse, the *Keimentschluß*, is poisoned. The artwork that unfolds from this tainted seed will necessarily be a vector for that same spiritual malaise. To engage with it, and especially to financially support it, is to become complicit. It is to water a poisoned seed.
