I watched ["A Bit of a Rant About Generative AI for Writing and Learning."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOrVyuH8mMs&t=613s) The guy starts with an analogy. If I tell a baker how to make a cake, I'm not the baker. The baker is. So if I tell an AI to write a story, the AI writes the story. I'm not the writer. And if you fix the output, you're editing. "Editing is not writing."
            
It's a clean image. And it's another example of defending the Romantic ideal of the author as a solitary creator. The whole rant depends on it.

### Who's the author?

The main argument is "it is doing the writing, not us." He treats writing as the physical act of putting the first draft on the page. By this logic, a person with a ghostwritten book isn't the author. A director in a writers' room isn't the author of the play. Obviously not how authorship works. It's about conceptual control, not who types.
            
The real problem is the rant needs a singular source. It's the same worldview as Whitman's in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," where an author has to be a single presence who "pours my meaning into you." A distributed process breaks this model. The guy's defending the author's soul, not their work.

### Editing as writing

The other claim: "editing is not writing." This only works if you think a text has to spring fully formed from one vision. Literary history disagrees. [Ezra Pound's work on *The Waste Land*](https://lithub.com/read-ezra-pounds-extensive-revisions-to-t-s-eliots-the-waste-land/) was composition. He changed its whole architecture. Dismissing this protects the myth of the solitary genius.
            
AI-assisted work is mostly rewriting. You throw out huge chunks of the first output, add your own stuff, rearrange everything. The AI supplies raw material. The human shapes it into something coherent. Saying this isn't writing comes from that Romantic defense of sincerity as the thing that matters. The work isn't authentic because the author didn't suffer for every word of the first draft.

### The struggle thing

The rant warns using AI is "cognitive offloading" and "we're not developing" our skills. This is the same argument as the pastor in Post 26: "We learn from the struggle." Bypassing the painful process is a moral failure, not a technical shortcut. The product's inauthentic because it wasn't born of suffering.
            
But this is a choice about method. Not a law. Using AI to get past the blank page isn't necessarily "outsourcing thought." It depends on how the rest of the work goes.

### A different analogy

The baker analogy doesn't work. Try the musician and the synthesizer. A synth generates sound on its own. We don't call it a song until a musician shapes it into a composition. No one says the synthesizer is the composer. The musician is. The AI is an instrument. Its output is noise until a writer gives it form.
            
The Youtuber's defending a particular model of the writer. It's one kind of writing that will keep on happening. But writing has never been something that always happens the same way (or with the same number of people). Writing has always been more than generating sentences. The Youtuber sounds afraid the-writer-as-baker will get replaced. I don't see why we need to close down the options. The Romantics can keep believing in their (simplified) picture of authorship. Kids just getting born will grow up doing their thing. It'll all happen and it'll be fine.
