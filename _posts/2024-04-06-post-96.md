In the last two posts, we explored two readings of Melville's scrivener. Žižek's analysis of Bartleby as a figure of pure, negative subtraction seems to align most easily with the story's more obvious details. A man refuses the world, is imprisoned, and dies. It's a bleak story, and Žižek's reading honors that bleakness. Deleuze's interpretation, which I framed as a "Deep Opt-In," feels much harder to justify. How can this story of isolation and death be about the creation of a new, affirmative way of life? Yet Deleuze insists it is. The purpose of this post is to take on that harder task: to show how Deleuze's creative, world-building reading finds its grounding in the concrete details of Melville's text.

First, Deleuze points out that Bartleby's formula is "contagious". This isn't just a clever observation; it's a key piece of textual evidence for his argument. The lawyer himself notices, with alarm, that he and his other clerks have started to "involuntarily" use the word "prefer" on "all sorts of not exactly suitable occasions". Turkey asks the lawyer if he would "prefer that I should" withdraw, and Nippers asks if he would "prefer to have a certain paper copied on blue paper or white". For Deleuze, this is the beginning of the new community taking shape. Bartleby's formula acts as a linguistic virus, breaking down the old language of command and reason. It forces the other characters onto a new, shared, and uncertain linguistic ground. It is the creation of a "society of brothers" united not by law or reason, but by a shared, irrational formula.

Second, Deleuze argues that Bartleby's presence "abolishes any paternal function". The story shows this happening in real time. The lawyer begins as the perfect benevolent father, a man of "prudence" and "method" who feels a charitable duty to his strange employee. But Bartleby's calm refusal completely "disarmed" and "unmanned" him, leaving him "bewildered, stunned, thunderstruck". The lawyer's paternal authority collapses. He is forced into a "zone of indetermination or indiscernibility" where the roles of boss and clerk, master and dependant, become blurred. He flees his own office while Bartleby remains immobile, becoming a "double" to the scrivener. This is the concrete "dissolution of the paternal function" that Deleuze argues is necessary before a new, non-hierarchical community can emerge.

Finally, there is the matter of Bartleby as the "man without references". When the lawyer asks Bartleby directly about his past (where he was born, anything about himself) the response is always the same: "I would prefer not to". The narrator himself states that "no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man". For Deleuze, this is not a sign of emptiness but of pure potentiality. Lacking a past, Bartleby is free. He is the "Original Man" Deleuze identifies with the American project: a "son of all nations" who is "without father or mother". His refusal to be defined by a personal history is what makes him a figure of the future. He is not opting out of life; he is opting in to a new form of it, one based not on who you were, but on the community you might create.

This is a difficult reading, but it is grounded in the story itself. The contagious formula, the lawyer's psychic breakdown, and Bartleby's radical lack of a past are all textual facts. For Deleuze, these are not signs of a story about nihilism and despair. They are the concrete steps in a revolutionary program.

So. Would the deep opt-in of Hegel want to sit down for supper with the Deleuzian form?
