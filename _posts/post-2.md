This is near the top of the list of things I can't understand. I know why journalists and historians don't like AI hallucinations and misinformation. Their job is to get the facts straight. But creative writing? It's hallucations all the way down. So I don't understand why fiction writers and poets worry about AI making stuff up. It's what we do.
