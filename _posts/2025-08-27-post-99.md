In [Post 98](/post-98), we arrived at a challenging conclusion: Hegel's and Deleuze's philosophies represent two "enemy opt-ins." But this raises a sharp and necessary question about the Deleuzian path. If his project is to create "new systems on the outside," as I put it, how can that be a "deep opt-in"? Doesn't creating something "outside" the system mean you've opted out? It's a fair question that gets to the heart of what makes Deleuze's form of engagement so different.

To clarify this, we first have to be very clear about what the "Deep Opt-Out" actually is. As this blog has defined it, the deep opt-out is a defensive posture. It's the path of the "beautiful soul" from the boycott series, a consciousness that, fearing moral contamination, chooses "principled withdrawal" from a corrupt world to preserve its own purity. Its primary goal is the *preservation* of a self that is imagined to pre-exist its engagement with the world. It is a retreat.

Deleuze's "outside" is not a fortress; it's a workshop. It is a space of profound and messy engagement with the materials of the world. The philosopher Joe Hughes provides a key insight here, arguing that Deleuze intentionally rejects the "postulate of goodwill." He is not a friendly guide but a "surly interlocutor" whose purpose is to break our unthinking habits. His method is an example of working "on the outside" while being deeply engaged. He practices a kind of "ventriloquism," getting so close to an author like Kant or Spinoza that he can make them produce a "monstrous offspring," a new idea that is both theirs and alien to them. This is not a retreat from the history of philosophy; it is an intense, transformative intervention within it. Bartleby himself performs this. He doesn't flee the office; he stays and creates a new reality *inside* the old one, operating "outside" its rules to transform it from within.

This reveals the fundamental difference between the two forms of opting in. The Hegelian "deep opt-in" is an opt-in to a system. The goal is for the Citizen to find their place and realize their freedom within the rational whole of "ethical life". It is an opt-in to a destination. The Deleuzian "deep opt-in," by contrast, is an opt-in to a process. It is a commitment to the perpetual, creative work of the Nomad, who actively engages with the world's materials to build new pathways and "lines of flight." As Hughes suggests, Deleuze's difficult prose is an "aesthetic education" designed to "engineer the basic failure of our reading habits" and force us into this creative process. To opt-in to Deleuze is to agree to this dangerous and open-ended project of thought itself.

The confusion comes from a spatial metaphor. The "outside" for Deleuze is not "away from the world" (the opt-out). It is "outside the world's established rules." The Deleuzian deep opt-in is therefore a commitment to the most engaged form of life possible: the constant work of creation at the edge of what already exists. It rejects the defensive purity of the beautiful soul and the stabilizing reconciliation of the Hegelian citizen in favor of the inventive path of the nomad.
