This post lists where the three non‑Romantic definitions of evil echo the Romantic definition in [Post 9](/post-9). I'm only noting agreement. Not differences.

### Romantic Evil in Philosophy Tube's "Systemic Harm"
- **Instrumentalization of persons:** Romantic "instrumentalism" (treating others and language as means) aligns with systemic harm's reduction of people and labor into data and resources (extraction, deskilling).
- **Flattening of the singular:** Romantic "levelling" (turning irreducible persons into interchangeable roles) parallels systemic projection and categorization that impose labels and erase particularity.
- **Opacity vs. living speech:** Romantic "living speech vs. empty forms" resonates with black‑box opacity that blocks answerability and genuine dialogue.
- **Kitsch communion and ideology:** Romantic "profaned communion" (faceless togetherness) tracks with hype/ideology that manufactures consensus without authentic encounter.
- **Mechanical repetition and deskilling:** Romantic "mechanical repetition" mirrors systems that routinize work and thin meaningful agency.

### Romantic Evil in New Polity's "Frustrated Ends"
- **Conversation and communion:** Romantic profaned communion (togetherness without persons) matches New Polity's simulacrum of dialogue that elicits vulnerability while withholding a someone who answers.
- **Truthful speech:** Romantic concern for "living speech" aligns with New Polity's emphasis on speech ordered to truth and promise‑keeping (against misalignment and the analogy to lying).
- **Integrity/vocation:** Romantic "betrayal of vocation and sincerity" fits the idea that acts divorced from their *telos* deform the agent (character "deformation").
- **Persons as ends:** Romantic rejection of instrumentalism converges with New Polity's ordering of acts to communion, not use. Treating persons as answerable centers, not means.
- **Habit and character:** Romantic fear of the "anti‑sublime" (no ultimate stakes) overlaps with habituation that deadens courage and love through repeated frustrated acts.

### Romantic Evil in Mac Loftin's "Imitative Negation"
- **Simulation vs. presence:** Romantic "inauthenticity" and "living speech vs. empty forms" converge with simulation without a subject. Outputs that look like works yet lack a maker's presence.
- **Photocopy decay and mechanical repetition:** Romantic "mechanical repetition" and the erosion of meaning match the photocopy‑of‑a‑photocopy thinning of the cultural commons.
- **Profaned communion and sacrilege:** Romantic "profaned communion" aligns with sacrilege, substituting imitation for presence in communal and sacred acts.
- **Instrumental cruelty:** Romantic warning against treating others as means connects with excited cruelty and memetic derision that instrumentalize attention and affection.
- **Integrity of making:** Romantic commitment to one's call and vowed seriousness harmonize with Loftin's defense of personed creativity (love's attentive labor) against hollow imitation.
