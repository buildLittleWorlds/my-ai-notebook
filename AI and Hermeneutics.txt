Hermeneutics and the Texts of Artificial Intelligence: A Genealogical Inquiry into Meaning Without an Author




Introduction: The Hermeneutic Question in the Age of the Algorithm


The rise of large language models (LLMs) forces a classic hermeneutical question into a stark new light: does the authorship of a text fundamentally alter how we interpret it?.1 For centuries, the theory of interpretation—hermeneutics—has debated the role of authorial intention, the weight of historical context, and the degree to which meaning is fixed or fluid. Now, these long-standing debates resonate with new urgency when the "author" is not a human consciousness but a machine.1 The prospect of a non-human, non-conscious origin for coherent, even compelling, discourse presents an unprecedented challenge to a tradition built on the premise of human communication.
This report undertakes a rigorous intellectual genealogy to navigate this challenge. It traces the evolution of hermeneutic thought chronologically, from its origins in the allegorical exegesis of antiquity to its deconstruction in postmodern theory, examining how fifteen key thinkers might respond to texts generated by artificial intelligence.1 By charting this history—through Origen, Augustine, Luther, Valla, Dannhauer, Ast, Schleiermacher, Böckh, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Gadamer, Betti, Ricoeur, and Derrida—we can assess whether the tradition of hermeneutics can accommodate "machine authorship" or if this phenomenon marks a genuine rupture, a point at which its foundational assumptions must be abandoned or radically revised.1
The inquiry is organized around a central dialectic that has structured the history of hermeneutics: the tension between author-centric and text-centric models of interpretation. For one lineage of thinkers, the very essence of interpretation is the recovery of a meaning originating in a human subject—be it the author's intended message, their lived experience (Erlebnis), or the unique historical context that shaped their thought.1 For this tradition, the absence of a human author poses a "fundamental problem," creating a vacuum at the very center of the interpretive act.1 For another lineage, however, meaning is understood to reside more fundamentally in language itself, in the traditions of discourse, or in the dynamic engagement between a text and its reader.1 From this perspective, the specific origin of a text is secondary, and the emergence of AI authorship becomes a less disruptive, and perhaps even a clarifying, phenomenon.
The stakes of this inquiry are profound. If an LLM produces a coherent poem, a well-argued essay, or a moving story, does it mean something in the same way a human-authored text does? This question is not entirely without precedent. Literary history provides test cases that have long challenged the stable link between author and meaning, from the automatic writing of the Surrealists to the pseudonymous works of modernists and the philosophical provocations of Jorge Luis Borges's short story Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote.1 Yet, the AI-generated text represents the most radical test case to date, forcing a direct confrontation with the possibility of discourse completely severed from a human life.
The emergence of AI-authored texts, therefore, functions not merely as a new topic for hermeneutics to analyze, but as a powerful philosophical catalyst that compels the entire tradition to confront its own foundational assumptions. The history of hermeneutics reveals a long, gradual evolution away from a simple reliance on authorial intent—from the Divine Author of antiquity, to the human genius of Romanticism, to the deconstructed "author function" of the 20th century. Thinkers like Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida famously announced the "death of the author" as a theoretical metaphor, arguing that the reader and the play of language are the true sites where meaning proliferates.1 An AI-generated text transforms this metaphor into a technical reality. There is, literally, no human origin, no consciousness, no lived experience to recover. It is the "death of the author" made manifest in silicon. Consequently, the AI text acts as an empirical test for two millennia of interpretive theory. It forces the two major camps—author-centric and text-centric—into a direct and unavoidable confrontation. It compels the author-centric camp to ask if its model can survive with a null value for the variable of "author," and it challenges the text-centric camp to prove that meaning can genuinely arise from a "lifeless" text without dissolving into arbitrary projection. The AI text does not just pose a question to hermeneutics; it
is the question, embodied.


Ancient and Medieval Foundations: Meaning Beyond the Human Author




Origen: Allegory, Divine Authorship, and the Independence of Meaning


The tradition of hermeneutics in the West begins, in part, with the practice of allegory, a method masterfully employed by the 3rd-century Alexandrian theologian Origen (c. 185-253). In his engagement with sacred texts, Origen proposed a multi-layered reality of meaning, one in which the literal, human-authored level could often be set aside in favor of deeper spiritual truths. He famously taught that Scripture possesses a "threefold sense" corresponding to the constitution of a human being: a "body" (the literal or historical sense), a "soul" (the moral sense), and a "spirit" (the mystical or allegorical sense).1 For Origen, the most profound meaning of the text resided in its spiritual interpretation, which was frequently independent of the literal historical narrative.1
At the core of Origen's framework is a radical decentering of the human author. He viewed the ultimate author of Scripture as God; the human writers, such as the prophets and evangelists, were merely instruments or vessels for the Holy Spirit.1 This belief had a powerful interpretive consequence: it allowed Origen to assert that the texts could contain truths that their human writers did not fully grasp. He went so far as to claim that some biblical passages were deliberately constructed by the Holy Spirit to be obscure or even nonsensical on a literal level, precisely to compel the diligent reader to seek a higher, spiritual meaning.1 This perspective effectively disentangled "meaning" from the conscious intentions or historical understanding of any human agent.
How would Origen's hermeneutics, which already operates beyond the human author, confront a text generated by an LLM? On one hand, his allegorical method suggests that the identity of the author is secondary to the potential for edifying meaning. If even divinely inspired texts can contain meanings unforeseen by their human writers, then interpretation is not strictly bound to recovering a human mind's intent. Origen might approach an AI-generated text, particularly one with moral or religious themes, by asking whether it could be mined for allegorical significance beneficial to the reader's soul.1
On the other hand, Origen's entire system is anchored in the assumption of an ultimate, divine intentionality. His allegorical readings, however creative, were not arbitrary; they were guided by the "rule of faith" and the belief that a divine Logos stood behind the text, ensuring its ultimate coherence.1 He would almost certainly deny that a secular, machine-produced text carries a hidden divine message by default. If an AI text was nonsensical or failed to cohere with spiritual truth, Origen might dismiss its literal layer as he did with certain biblical passages, but he would only invest the effort of allegorical reading if he believed some higher mind or reason was at work.1 A purely random string of words would not merit such treatment. Thus, while his method suggests continuity in the interpretive act—seeking edification and truth—the fundamental problem would arise from the absence of a divine guarantor. Absent this guarantor, an AI text's "deeper meaning" might just be an illusion, a projection of the reader's own fancy—the very kind of uncontrolled interpretation he was often criticized for.1


Augustine: Authorial Intention and the Charity of Interpretation


A few centuries after Origen, St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430) offered a more nuanced and influential model of interpretation that balanced a respect for authorial intention with a pragmatic openness to multiple meanings. In his seminal treatise On Christian Doctrine, Augustine established principles that would shape medieval exegesis. He valued the intent of the human author, yet he also acknowledged that a text, especially Scripture, could yield true meanings beyond what its writer consciously intended, provided those meanings served a higher purpose.1
Augustine's framework is famously Janus-faced. He holds up the author's intended meaning as the ideal "straight road" for the interpreter.1 "Whoever takes another meaning out of Scripture than the writer intended, goes astray," he warns. However, he immediately qualifies this with his overriding hermeneutic principle: the "rule of charity." If the unintended meaning that a reader derives nonetheless promotes the "twofold love of God and neighbor," then "his error is not pernicious... he is wholly clear of deception".1 An interpretation is ultimately judged by its fruits. This means Augustine would likely ask of an LLM-generated text: does it lead the reader toward truth and love? If the answer is yes, then an interpretation that yields a pious or ethical insight could be considered valid, even if the text had "no author" in the conventional sense.1
This approach is rooted in Augustine's understanding of Scripture as a text with a dual authorship: human and divine. In his Confessions, he reflects on the Genesis creation narrative and suggests that God may have deliberately inspired a text capable of supporting multiple true interpretations, so that people of different intellectual capacities could all find spiritual nourishment.1 He speculates that if a reader discovers a truth in Scripture that the human author (Moses) might not have had in mind, perhaps the Holy Spirit intended that truth to be found all along.1 This introduces the idea of a text's potential plurality of meanings, governed by an ultimate divine intent. Applying this to AI texts is complex, as there is no divine author. Yet, Augustine's emphasis on the interpretive
goal—building up love—suggests that the act of interpretation could proceed, judged by its outcomes rather than its fidelity to an origin.
The cases of Origen and Augustine, when projected onto the problem of AI, reveal a foundational principle for hermeneutics. When the authorial source of a text is uncertain, transcendent (as with God), or entirely absent (as with an AI), the burden of grounding the interpretation shifts from the author's mind to the interpreter's own character and guiding framework. Origen justifies his allegories not by appealing to the psychology of the human author, but to a divine author and a theological "rule of faith".1 Similarly, Augustine validates unintended meanings by measuring them against an ethical "rule of charity".1 In both instances, the check against arbitrary or false interpretation is not a psychological reconstruction but an external, normative standard.
When faced with an AI text, which has neither a human nor a divine author, these ancient models suggest that the only way to ground interpretation is through a similar normative framework. The interpreter can no longer ask, "What did the author mean?" Instead, they are forced to ask a different question: "What is the most truthful, ethical, or charitable meaning that can be constructed from this text, guided by my principles?" This reframes the "fundamental problem" of an authorless text. It is not an interpretive impossibility but an ethical challenge. It compels the interpreter to become transparent about their own guiding principles—their own "rule of faith" or "rule of charity." Hermeneutics, in this light, is revealed to be less about the objective recovery of a past mental state and more about the responsible, ethically-grounded construction of meaning in the present. The AI text, by its very nature, lays bare this moral dimension of interpretation that was always present but often obscured by the intense focus on authorial intent.


Renaissance and Reformation: The Reassertion of Authenticity and the Literal Sense




Lorenzo Valla: Philology, Forgeries, and the Importance of Authentic Texts


The Renaissance humanist Lorenzo Valla (1407-1457) represents a pivotal moment in the history of interpretation, shifting the focus toward critical philology, historical context, and textual authenticity. While not a hermeneutic theorist in the systematic sense, his work established a crucial principle: the meaning of a text is inextricably bound to its historical and linguistic origins.1 Valla's most celebrated achievement was his 1440 exposé of the
Donation of Constantine as a forgery. This document, supposedly a 4th-century decree from Emperor Constantine granting vast temporal power to the Pope, had been a cornerstone of papal authority for centuries. Valla applied his mastery of classical Latin and his sharp historical sense to demonstrate that the language of the Donation was filled with anachronisms—words, phrases, and administrative terms that could not have been written in Constantine's era but belonged to the 8th century.1 This was a triumph of forensic hermeneutics: by dissecting the text's linguistic fabric, Valla revealed its true historical context and, therefore, its true nature as a fraudulent power claim.1
For Valla, it mattered enormously who wrote a text and when, because this information determines what the text can legitimately mean. His approach was animated by the humanist motto ad fontes—"to the sources." He meticulously compared St. Jerome's Latin Vulgate Bible with the original Greek New Testament manuscripts, identifying translation errors that had significant theological implications. For instance, he noted that the Greek word metanoeite meant an inner "repentance," not the sacramental "do penance" (poenitentiam agite) of the Vulgate, a correction that shifted the focus from an external church rite to an internal change of heart.1 This commitment to the literal, philological meaning of words in their authentic context meant that interpretation had to be anchored in historical reality.
If Lorenzo Valla were confronted with an AI-generated text, his reaction would likely be one of deep suspicion centered on authenticity. He might treat it as a new and perplexing kind of forgery: a "forgery by no one".1 His first instinct would be to subject it to a battery of linguistic and stylistic tests. Since an AI text is a composite, drawing on a vast and diverse corpus, Valla's philological eye would likely detect the seams. He might observe that the text oddly blends phrases from different authors or historical periods—a sentence with a Ciceronian cadence followed by one with a modern colloquialism—and conclude that no single human author with a consistent idiolect could have written it. He would label it a
pastiche or a cento (a collage of quotations), not an original, unified work.1
For Valla, meaning is tied to a specific authorial context. Just as identifying the Donation as an 8th-century work changed its meaning from a legitimate imperial decree to a self-serving fabrication, identifying a text as the product of an AI would, for him, render its meaning derivative and second-hand. From his perspective, an AI text has no stable historical Sitz im Leben (setting in life); it is a chimera that floats free of any single time or place, making precise interpretation impossible.1 The humanist impulse to return to the original source would lead Valla to look past the AI's output to the human-authored primary texts it was trained on. The AI text itself would dissolve as an object of interpretation; what would remain for analysis are the fragments of genuine human expression it echoes.1 In this way, Valla's method suggests that hermeneutics, when faced with an AI text, must either deconstruct it into its constituent parts to interpret them in their rightful contexts or dismiss the text as uninterpretable.


Martin Luther: The Literal Sense and the Question of Authentic Voice


The 16th-century Reformation, spearheaded by Martin Luther (1483-1546), initiated a hermeneutic revolution by championing the literal, plain meaning of Scripture over the multivalent allegorical interpretations of the medieval tradition. Reacting against what he saw as the "empty speculations" and "froth" of allegory, Luther insisted that "it is the historical sense alone which supplies the true and sound doctrine".1 By this
sensus literalis, he meant the straightforward meaning of the words as intended by the author in their original linguistic and historical context. This did not imply a naive literalism—he acknowledged figures of speech—but a resolute focus on the one simple, coherent sense he believed shone forth from the text.1
Luther's hermeneutics was grounded in his doctrine of the clarity (perspicuity) of Scripture and his principle of sola Scriptura (Scripture alone). He believed that ordinary Christians, guided by the Holy Spirit, could grasp the essential message of the Bible without needing the secret keys of allegorists or the authoritative glosses of the Church.1 For Luther, authorial intention (both human and, ultimately, divine) coalesced with the literal sense. The interpreter's task was to hear the authentic voice of God's Word speaking through the text, a voice that he believed always "drives towards Christ" (
was Christum treibet).1
Given this profound concern with authenticity and the truthfulness of the Word, Luther's outlook would find an AI-generated text deeply problematic. His first concern would be its lack of authority. Luther spent considerable effort establishing the reliable text of Scripture and was quick to identify and reject apocryphal or forged elements.1 An AI-generated "Gospel" or theological treatise would be dismissed out of hand as having zero authority. For Luther, interpretation begins with the premise that the text is a truthful testimony. A text with no human life behind it would strike him as potentially soulless and deceptive—a "dead letter" even if its propositions were doctrinally correct.1
If forced to engage with an AI text, Luther would judge it strictly on its content, measuring it against the clear message of the Gospel. If an AI-produced sermon correctly articulated the doctrine of justification by faith, a pragmatic Luther might remark that God can speak truth even through a machine, just as He once spoke through Balaam's donkey.1 However, he would more likely find the text to be "froth"—a disembodied mimicry lacking the life that comes from the Holy Spirit moving a human heart.1 The interpretive act, for Luther, was not a detached academic exercise but a life-transforming struggle (
Anfechtung) with the living Word of God. An AI text, lacking an authentic, faithful voice, could not be a partner in such a struggle. He would likely see no mystery or deeper layer to mine, only a surface to be judged as true or false.
The challenge posed by AI texts reveals that the Renaissance and Reformation turn toward the literal did not create a single, unified method, but rather a bifurcated one, establishing a polarity between textual forensics and doctrinal judgment that persists today. Valla's response to a text of questionable origin is to launch a forensic investigation into its provenance, language, and historical consistency.1 Luther's response is to measure its content against an established body of truth—the clear word of Scripture.1 These represent two distinct criteria for textual legitimacy: historical authenticity (Valla) and doctrinal truthfulness (Luther).
Modern critical responses to AI-generated content often fall along these same lines. One approach, a direct intellectual descendant of Valla's philology, focuses on a form of "data forensics." It asks: What were the training data? What biases are embedded in the model? Can we trace this specific output back to its sources? This is a historical-critical investigation of the text's origins. The other dominant approach mirrors Luther's method of doctrinal testing. It asks: Is the AI's output factually correct? Does it align with scientific consensus, legal precedent, or established ethical norms? This is a content-based evaluation of the text's claims against a master framework of truth. The AI text, by its authorless nature, forces hermeneutics to choose its ground. It reveals that "literalism" itself is not a monolithic field but a dynamic tension between source-criticism and content-criticism, a tension first brought into sharp relief by the critical methods of the Renaissance and Reformation.


The Rise of General and Romantic Hermeneutics




Johann Conrad Dannhauer: The Birth of General Hermeneutics and the Good Interpreter


In the 17th century, hermeneutics began to be systematically theorized as a universal discipline, applicable to all forms of discourse. The German Lutheran theologian Johann Conrad Dannhauer (1603-1666) is a key figure in this transition, credited with coining the term "general hermeneutics" (hermeneutica generalis) and authoring what is considered the first textbook on the subject, Idea boni interpretis et malitiosi calumniatoris ("The Idea of the Good Interpreter and of the Malicious Critic") in 1630.1 Dannhauer's work signals a crucial shift: interpretation is no longer confined to specialized fields like theology (
hermeneutica sacra) or law (hermeneutica iuris), but is conceived as a general art of understanding.1
The very title of his treatise reveals a strong ethical dimension. Dannhauer explicitly contrasts the "good interpreter," who acts in good faith to discern the genuine meaning of a text, with the "malicious critic" or "calumniator," who willfully twists words to find fault or impose a false meaning.1 This underscores a central concern that interpretation requires a virtuous disposition—honesty, diligence, and a commitment to truth—to avoid distortion.1 Building on the Protestant scholastic tradition, Dannhauer sought to systematize a methodical approach to ensure objectivity. He framed hermeneutics as a branch of logic or epistemology, a set of rules for avoiding misunderstanding, arguing that without such discipline, the vast knowledge contained in texts could be "spoiled and ruined".1
Dannhauer's framework for the good interpreter was holistic. He inherited and adapted the classical idea of analyzing a text in terms of the four Aristotelian causes: the author as the efficient cause, the source material as the material cause, the structure and genre as the formal cause, and the purpose (skopos) as the final cause.1 This comprehensive approach immediately faces challenges when applied to an LLM-generated text. The "efficient cause" is a non-person, and the "final cause" is either absent (the AI has no purpose of its own) or indirect (it is the purpose of the user's prompt or the developers' design).1
How, then, could Dannhauer's system adapt? The key lies in the concept of the intentio operis (the intention of the work), a notion he anticipated by urging the interpreter to grasp the purpose that can be inferred from the text itself, independent of the author's psychology.1 A good interpreter can analyze an AI text's genre, structure, and rhetoric to determine its implied purpose—for example, identifying that it reads like a textbook explanation and should therefore be interpreted as an informative piece. The ethical imperative remains paramount: the "good interpreter" of an AI text must be especially careful not to become a "malicious calumniator" by projecting meanings that the text's own words do not support, particularly since no author is present to object.1 The interpreter's virtue becomes even more crucial when the authorial mind, a key piece of the hermeneutic puzzle, is missing.


Friedrich Ast: The Hermeneutic Circle and the Spirit of the Whole


With Friedrich Ast (1778-1841), hermeneutics enters the intellectual climate of German Romanticism, acquiring a more philosophical and holistic character. Ast is celebrated for his articulation of the hermeneutic circle: the fundamental insight that understanding a text involves a cyclical movement between its parts and the whole. As he formulated it, "the basic principle of all understanding was a cyclical process of coming to understand the parts through the whole and the whole through the parts".1 For Ast, this was not a vicious circle but a productive dialectic, a process of gradually refining one's comprehension.
Crucially, Ast anchored this process in the Romantic concept of Geist (spirit). He believed in an "original unity of all being," and in the context of interpretation, this meant that every text is an organic expression of the spirit of its author and its age.1 To truly understand a text, the interpreter must discern its "inner meaning or spirit"—the guiding
Grundidee (fundamental idea) that unifies the work as an organic whole.1 This requires a sympathetic immersion into the text's world, a reconstruction of the creative spirit that produced it, set against the backdrop of the broader cultural spirit, or
Volkgeist.1
This romantic-holistic framework immediately collides with the phenomenon of the AI-generated text. The central question becomes: Is a machine text an organic whole with an inner spirit? An AI text, as a statistical assemblage of linguistic fragments, seems to lack the very organic unity and intentional Geist that Ast's method seeks to uncover.1 Ast would likely find such a text to be soulless, a mechanical concatenation of words rather than a living expression. The hermeneutic circle might break down, as the interpreter's attempt to infer a coherent whole from the parts would be frustrated by the text's fractured, patchwork nature.1
However, Ast's framework contains a possible, if strained, adaptation. His concept of Geist was not limited to the individual author but extended to the historical spirit of an era.1 One could argue that an AI text, while lacking an individual spirit, expresses the collective "spirit of the data" it was trained on—in other words, the amalgamated
Geist of a vast library of human writing. In this view, the AI becomes a channel for the Zeitgeist (spirit of the time). An interpreter could then attempt to discern a Grundidee that the AI text inadvertently reveals about our contemporary culture's tropes, biases, and commonplaces.1 This would shift the interpretive focus from an individual psyche to a collective, cultural one.
The challenges posed to Dannhauer and Ast reveal a recurring pattern in how early modern hermeneutics must adapt to authorless texts: the interpreter is forced to proceed "as if" a rational, unified author existed. This constitutes a foundational, though often unstated, methodological fiction. To apply his causal analysis, Dannhauer's interpreter must infer a purpose or intentio operis from the text's form, treating the work as if it intended its own structure.1 To apply his hermeneutic circle, Ast's interpreter must seek a unifying
Grundidee to lend coherence to the parts, assuming an organic unity that may not have been present at the source.1
In both cases, the interpreter searches for a principle of unity and intention that, in a human-authored work, would correspond to a psychological reality. In an AI text, this principle does not exist at the origin. Therefore, the interpreter must adopt a heuristic: "I will treat this text as if it were written by a single, rational author with a coherent purpose." This is not a claim about the text's actual genesis but a necessary precondition to make sense of it at all. This reveals that a significant part of interpreting AI texts is not a recovery of pre-existing meaning but a simulation of the interpretive process for human texts. The interpreter effectively plays both roles: they project a hypothetical authorial unity onto the text and then "discover" that unity through their analysis. This "as if" structure represents a crucial adaptation of hermeneutics. It suggests that meaning in AI texts is not found but is made through a disciplined act of constructive reading, one that mimics the search for an authorial mind. While a later thinker like Schleiermacher would find this epistemically unsound, it may represent the only pragmatic path forward for applying classical hermeneutic methods to these new textual forms.1


The Zenith of 19th-Century Hermeneutics: Reconstructing the Human Mind




Friedrich Schleiermacher: Reconstructing the Author – A Dilemma for AI Texts


Often hailed as the "father of modern hermeneutics," Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834) developed a comprehensive and universal theory of interpretation applicable to all forms of human communication.1 His method is characterized by a dual focus, a dialectical interplay between two complementary moments:
grammatical interpretation and psychological (or technical) interpretation.1 The grammatical moment involves grasping the text's relationship to the shared system of language—its vocabulary, syntax, and genre conventions. The psychological moment, which Schleiermacher considered the higher art, aims to grasp the author's specific, individual intention—to understand the text as an expression of that person's unique thoughts and creative act.1 The ultimate goal of interpretation, in his view, is to "re-think the author's thought," to reconstruct the unique mental process that brought the text into being.1
This project culminates in his famously ambitious claim that the ideal interpreter can understand a text "just as well or even better than its creator".1 This does not imply a mystical mind-reading, but rather that a skilled analyst, through comparative knowledge and intuition, might perceive patterns, connections, or implications in the work that the author produced unconsciously or only tacitly understood.1 Crucially, however, this entire hermeneutic enterprise presupposes a human author with determinate thoughts, feelings, and a specific worldview (
Weltanschauung).1
When this author-centric method is set against a text generated by an AI, it faces a startling and profound dilemma. The grammatical dimension of Schleiermacher's method can still be applied. An AI text is written in human language and, as such, an interpreter can parse its sentences, analyze its use of genre conventions, and check its usage against linguistic norms.1 This half of the hermeneutic circle remains intact.
The heart of the matter, however, is the psychological interpretation, and it is here that the method hits an insurmountable "wall".1 The task of reconstructing the creative act behind the text becomes impossible because, in the human sense, there was no creative act. There is no "living mind" to recover, no moment of inspiration, no intention to communicate a message or evoke a feeling—only an algorithm processing probabilities.1 Schleiermacher's hermeneutics asks the interpreter to practice a form of
Einfühlung (empathic understanding), but this is rendered meaningless when there is no Fühlen (feeling) on the other side.1 The dialogical model of interpretation, which imagines a conversation between reader and author mediated by the text, collapses when one of the participants is a phantom.
This absence of an intentional subject would likely lead Schleiermacher to conclude that interpreting an AI text is an inherently inferior, if not fundamentally different, activity. The hermeneutic circle becomes "lopsided," and its ultimate goal, or telos—a meeting of minds—is frustrated from the outset.1 He might warn that any attempt at a "psychological" reading would be a kind of masquerade, where the interpreter projects a fictional author behind the text and then interprets
as if that author were real. This would be a form of self-deception, a violation of the epistemic integrity his method strove to achieve. It would be like interpreting an "echo as if it were a voice".1 The result is not a reconstruction of another's thought, but a hallucination of an author's inner truth, the very kind of misunderstanding his hermeneutics was designed to eliminate.1


August Böckh: Philological Hermeneutics and the Retrieval of Knowledge


Moving to the next generation, August Böckh (1785-1867), a student of classical antiquity, offers a perspective shaped by the rigorous discipline of philology. Böckh defined philology in an almost encyclopedic manner as anagnosis: the "knowledge of what humans have already known".1 In contrast to philosophy, which seeks knowledge of truth (
gnosis), philology's task is to recover and understand the thought of others as it has been recorded in texts.1 This definition reveals his focus on objective knowledge and meticulous historical scholarship. He tilted Schleiermacher's general hermeneutics toward a more scientific methodology, viewing the interpreter as a scholar-detective whose task is to assemble all available evidence to determine as accurately as possible what a text meant in its original setting.1
At first glance, Böckh's emphasis on rigorous method might suggest that an AI text can be interpreted like any other. His hermeneutics is less overtly psychological than Schleiermacher's; it leans more on establishing facts about language, sources, and historical relations.1 However, a problem arises immediately: which context? For Böckh, every text belongs to an author's specific milieu and reflects that author's knowledge. An AI text, in contrast, has no single time or place; its "knowledge" is an amalgamation from innumerable sources and contexts.1
Böckh's method would likely adapt by shifting its focus. Instead of interpreting the text as the expression of an individual mind, he would interpret it as a derivative work, a composite object whose origins must be traced. A Böckhian analyst would approach an AI text much like a philologist would approach an ancient compendium or a plagiarized patchwork: by disassembling it and tracing its fragments to their sources.1 The hermeneutic task becomes one of identifying which parts are drawn from which traditions, noting allusions, and evaluating the coherence of the mosaic. This is a fundamentally critical and source-oriented mode. He would approach the text with suspicion, looking for anachronistic combinations of ideas that would betray its inauthentic, pastiche nature—much as his humanist predecessor Lorenzo Valla had done with forgeries.1
For Böckh, whose mission was to retrieve knowledge from the past faithfully, a text that freely mixes contexts would be a dangerous object, as it could mislead us about what was truly known or thought in a given era.1 His ultimate verdict might be that such a text is not a proper object for hermeneutics as understanding, but rather for "philological dissection".1 The interpretive act transforms into something more akin to data forensics: a reconstruction of the process that generated the text rather than a communion with an author's thought.


Wilhelm Dilthey: Life-Expression and the Challenge of a Lifeless Text


In the late 19th century, Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911) explicitly established hermeneutics as the methodological foundation for the human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften), drawing a sharp distinction between their interpretive methods and the explanatory methods of the natural sciences. For Dilthey, the natural sciences explain (Erklären) phenomena by subsuming them under causal laws, whereas the human sciences understand (Verstehen) human creations by grasping their intentional meanings.1
Central to his entire project is the idea that every human artifact—a poem, a diary, a legal system—is a Lebensäußerung, an "expression of life".1 These are not mere objects, but manifestations of an author's lived experience (
Erlebnis), shaped by their unique psychology and historical moment. The act of understanding, for Dilthey, involves a combination of historical consciousness and an empathic reconstruction of this experience. Through a process of Nacherleben (re-experiencing), the interpreter uses the shared ground of human nature to imaginatively relive a part of the author's inner life, bridging the historical gap through sympathetic interpretation buttressed by historical research.1
When viewed through Dilthey's lens, an AI-generated text presents an unprecedented conundrum, for it is, by definition, "lifeless." It is not born of a living human's experiences but of a computational algorithm. It fails the most basic criterion of being a Lebensäußerung. It has form, but no Erlebnis from which that form arose.1 This suggests a "genuine rupture" for Dilthey's system.1 If the goal of understanding is to grasp life expressing itself, then an AI text, which has no life behind it, is a hermeneutical orphan. The back-and-forth movement between the outer form (the text) and the inner content (the author's experience) that lies at the heart of Dilthey's hermeneutic circle is short-circuited. When the interpreter goes looking for the inner content, they find an empty set.1
Dilthey might react by arguing that such a text is not genuinely an object for the Geisteswissenschaften at all, because the Geist (spirit/mind) is missing.1 The attempt to understand it would be more akin to the causal explanation (
Erklären) he reserved for the natural sciences. One could explain how the text was produced by referencing the algorithm and the training data, but one could not understand it in the rich, humanistic sense of encountering another's subjectivity. Any empathy the reader feels would be a one-sided projection, not a genuine meeting of minds. The hermeneutic bridge that Dilthey envisioned, which connects subjectivities across time, would be left with one end dangling in mid-air.1
Schleiermacher, Böckh, and Dilthey, despite their significant differences, collectively represent what might be called a "humanist wall" in the history of hermeneutics. Their respective projects, which defined the zenith of 19th-century interpretive theory, are all predicated on the existence of a human subject—possessing a psyche, a concrete historical location, and a lived experience—as the ultimate source and object of understanding. Schleiermacher seeks to reconstruct the author's unique creative act.1 Böckh seeks to retrieve the objective knowledge known by a specific author or culture at a specific time.1 Dilthey seeks to re-experience the lived reality that gave rise to the text.1 All three view the text as a bridge to a past human consciousness.
The AI-generated text runs squarely into this wall. It is a bridge to nowhere—an objectification of a process, not a life. Therefore, for this entire, pivotal tradition, the core purpose of hermeneutics is thwarted. The advent of a non-human author reveals a fundamental limit within 19th-century hermeneutics: its very success in creating a rigorous methodology for the human sciences tied it inextricably to the human. The tradition, as defined by these thinkers, cannot accommodate a non-human "author" without fundamentally altering its own goals. Their only recourse is to reduce the interpretive act to a lower, incomplete form: mere grammatical analysis for Schleiermacher, philological dissection for Böckh, or causal explanation for Dilthey. This is not just a problem posed by AI texts; it is a revelation about the inherent anthropocentrism of this era in hermeneutic thought. The thinkers who follow in the 20th century will have to dismantle this wall to move forward.


The Post-Authorial Turn: Suspicion, Power, and Language




Friedrich Nietzsche: Interpretation as Will to Power – Who Cares Who the Author Is?


Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) stands as a disruptive force in the history of interpretation. Though not a systematic hermeneutic theorist, his philosophy offers a radical rethinking of truth, language, and meaning. He famously proclaimed, "there are no facts, only interpretations," shattering the 19th-century ideal of objective recovery.1 For Nietzsche, all understanding is perspectival, an expression of the "will to power"—the fundamental drive of forces to impose their own framework on the world.1 "Truths," in his view, are merely interpretations that have become dominant through power and habit, "illusions we have forgotten are illusions".1
Nietzsche was deeply skeptical of the idea of a stable, rational author whose singular intention could ground a text's meaning. He suggested that the "subject" or "author" might itself be a convenient fiction, a unity we invent to mask a chaotic nexus of drives and influences.1 His own method was a "hermeneutics of suspicion," unmasking the implicit power dynamics, historical accidents, and psychological needs that lie beneath the surface of any discourse.1
Given this iconoclastic stance, Nietzsche would likely be unperturbed by an AI-authored text; indeed, he might relish it as a perfect demonstration of his philosophy. The absence of an authorial intention simply makes explicit what he believed was always true: meaning is not something recovered from a sanctified origin but something created and imposed by the interpreter. "Who cares who the author is?" could serve as a Nietzschean slogan.1 From his vantage, the traditional hermeneutical deference to an author's intent looks like a "slave morality of interpretation," which he would urge the interpreter to overcome by asserting their own meaning.1
An AI text, as a pastiche of its training data, makes literal what Roland Barthes (a later thinker influenced by Nietzsche) would call a "tissue of quotations drawn from innumerable centres of culture".1 For Nietzsche, this simply reveals that all texts are, at a deep level, composites of prior discourse. The AI is a hyperbolic manifestation of the cultural collective speaking without an individual—the "death of the author" made flesh.1 He might analyze an AI text not for its purported content but as a symptom of the "herd morality" embedded in its data, a mirror reflecting the decadent or conventional values of the society that produced it.1
However, it would be too simple to cast Nietzsche as a relativist celebrating any and all interpretations. His concept of the will to power implies that not all interpretations are equal; the strongest, most life-affirming, and creativity-enhancing ones should triumph.1 While he would dismiss concerns about authorial intent, he might still criticize AI texts as lacking the Dionysian spark of true creativity. A machine cannot suffer or struggle; therefore, it cannot produce something truly great, only clever pastiche. An AI is bound by its data; it can only recycle existing values. Nietzsche, the advocate of the
Übermensch who creates new values, would likely see AI as inherently tied to the "last man"—comfortably and banally rearranging the given.1 It is all Apollonian surface (form, appearance) with no Dionysian depth (primal, creative vitality).1


Martin Heidegger: Language as the House of Being – What if the House Speaks by Itself?


Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) revolutionized hermeneutics by shifting its focus from a methodological practice to an ontological condition. In Being and Time (1927), he argued that understanding (Verstehen) is not something we do to texts, but a fundamental mode of being for human existence (Dasein).1 Hermeneutics, for Heidegger, is the explication of how we are always already interpreting our world, grounded in our prior involvements and "fore-structures" of understanding.1 In his later work, he famously described language as "the house of Being," suggesting that language itself is the primary site where meaning and truth are disclosed, rather than being a mere product of a subject's will. His aphorism, "Language speaks" (
Die Sprache spricht), posits that meaning arises from a larger clearing that language provides, often preceding and shaping individual intention.1
An AI-authored text presents a scenario that is uncannily like language speaking by itself, a house generating discourse without a human inhabitant. Heidegger might approach this phenomenon with a mixture of intrigue and profound caution. On one hand, it seems to confirm his idea that meaning is not the private concoction of a subject. The AI's output, stitched together from the sediment of countless human speakings in its training corpus, is a literalization of language recombining and speaking from itself.1
On the other hand, Heidegger would likely diagnose this speech as a sterile and inauthentic form of discourse. He drew a sharp distinction in Being and Time between authentic discourse and Gerede (idle talk or chatter). Gerede is the circulation of discourse that is not grounded in a genuine, first-hand engagement with things themselves, but is merely passed along, creating the "possibility of understanding everything without previously making the thing one's own".1 An AI that has swallowed the internet and regurgitates statistically probable prose is the apotheosis of
Gerede. It is hyper-idle-talk: language that is grammatically correct and superficially coherent but lacks any authentic "being-in-the-world" behind it.1
From this perspective, Heidegger would likely perform a meta-hermeneutic move. He would be less interested in interpreting the content of a specific AI essay and more interested in interpreting the phenomenon of AI-generated text itself. He would ask what this phenomenon reveals about our mode of being in the technological age. He would likely see it as a powerful symptom of the Ge-stell (enframing), his term for the way modern technology frames the entire world, including language, as a "standing-reserve"—a resource to be ordered, optimized, and deployed on demand.1 An AI text is language treated as a resource, summoned to fulfill a prompt. This, for Heidegger, would represent a further stage in
Seinsvergessenheit (the forgetfulness of Being), a condition where we become content with simulated, easily consumable meaning rather than engaging in the difficult, authentic questioning of Being.1


Hans-Georg Gadamer: Dialogue and Tradition – Can the Fusion of Horizons Occur with a Machine?


Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002), Heidegger's most influential student, developed philosophical hermeneutics into a theory of understanding centered on dialogue, tradition, and history. In his magnum opus Truth and Method (1960), Gadamer argues that understanding is not the result of a detached, objective method but is a dialogical event, a "fusion of horizons" between the interpreter and the text.1 We always approach a text with our "prejudices" (pre-judgments), which are not obstacles to be eliminated but the very starting points of understanding, shaped by our place in tradition. The text, too, has a horizon—the world of meaning it projects. Understanding occurs as an event when, in a process akin to a genuine conversation, our horizon merges with the text's horizon, expanding our own perspective.1
Crucially, Gadamer de-emphasized the importance of recovering the author's original intention. He argued that the meaning of a text transcends its author because it enters into new historical contexts and continues to speak to new generations, who bring new questions to it.1 What matters is engaging with the "claim to truth" that the text makes on us in the present.1
This framework is surprisingly robust when faced with an AI-generated text. Since Gadamer's model does not require a flesh-and-blood author, the absence of one is not a fatal flaw. An AI text is still a product of tradition in a raw, literal sense—its training data is a vast repository of historical language and discourse. Therefore, an interpreter can still enter into a "conversation" with the collective tradition that speaks through the AI's words.1 If an AI writes a sonnet, that text stands in the poetic tradition; if it writes a legal argument, it stands in the legal tradition. The interpreter's horizon can still engage with the horizon of the tradition embodied in the text.1
However, Gadamer's model also presents a potential limitation. A genuine dialogue, for him, requires an encounter with "otherness"—something that can challenge our prejudices and force us to see the world differently. An AI text, often designed to be congruent and to reflect mainstream or statistically probable views, might lack this critical otherness. It might act more like a mirror, confirming our expectations and reinforcing our preconceptions, leading to a shallow fusion or a "closed circuit" where we only hear an echo of our own era's discourse.1 The conversation might be "thinner," less likely to produce the transformative event of truth that Gadamer cherished.1
Nevertheless, Gadamer would likely contend that the hermeneutic act remains possible. The interpreter can still approach the text with openness, listen for what it says, and test it against their own understanding. The "author function" is simply replaced by the "language and tradition function".1 The interpretability of any text, in his view, rests on the common ground of language and history that connects us, not on the living presence of an author.
The work of Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Gadamer signals a crucial inversion in the history of hermeneutics. For the 19th-century thinkers, the primary object of interpretation was the human mind behind the text. Their methods were fundamentally reconstructive, aiming to recover a past psychological or historical reality. With the post-authorial turn, the object of interpretation becomes the cultural, traditional, or ontological world in front of the text. Nietzsche interprets a text to reveal the cultural power dynamics it expresses.1 Heidegger interprets it to see how Being is disclosed or concealed in our technological age.1 Gadamer interprets it to engage with the tradition it carries forward into the present.1
In all three cases, the focus has shifted from a reconstructive-psychological task to a critical-ontological one. They are no longer asking primarily, "Who spoke?" but rather, "What world is being spoken here?" This inversion makes the absence of a human author far less problematic. An AI text, while lacking a psyche behind it, still projects a "world"—the world of its training data, the world of herd morality, the world of technological enframing, the world of tradition's accumulated discourse. This is why these thinkers can accommodate AI texts: their hermeneutics was already looking at the mirror of language, not trying to reconstruct the face that once stood before it. The AI text is an excellent, if sometimes distorted, mirror for this kind of reflection.


Objectivity, Autonomy, and Deconstruction in the 20th Century




Emilio Betti: Objectivity and Authorial Will – Is an AI Text Interpretively Legitimate?


Emilio Betti (1890-1968), an Italian legal scholar, stands as a staunch 20th-century defender of the classical, objectivist tradition of hermeneutics, reacting strongly against what he perceived as the relativism of the Heidegger-Gadamer trend.1 Betti insisted on the possibility and necessity of objective understanding—that is, recovering the meaning intended by the author in a way that is not wholly colored by the interpreter's own perspective.1 He viewed interpretation as a methodical process governed by canons, such as the "hermeneutical autonomy of the object" (the text's meaning must be found in its own context) and the "correspondence of meaning" (the interpretation should correspond to the author's expressed intention).1 For Betti, a text is the product of a human spirit (
Geist), and the interpreter's task is to reproduce (nachbilden) the author's thought in their own mind.1
Given this framework, an AI-generated text represents a "nightmare scenario".1 The central pillar of his theory—a determinate authorial will that gives the text its meaning—is completely absent. Betti might well ask, "Is an AI text interpretively legitimate?" and be tempted to answer in the negative.1 For him, interpretation without an author's intent is like trying to translate a language with no speaker; any meaning we ascribe is largely our own projection, the very subjective arbitrariness his method was designed to prevent.1
He would likely argue that an AI text is a "pseudo-text," something that has the form of a text but lacks its proper ontological status because it was not born of a human intention.1 The absence of an authorial mind removes the fundamental criterion for a correct interpretation. Without that anchor, interpretation risks becoming a free play of subjectivity, which Betti would label as a form of nihilism in meaning.1 He would likely conclude that, strictly speaking, one cannot "interpret" an AI text in the scholarly sense; one can only analyze it as one would a naturally occurring pattern. If pressed, he would advise reconstructing the human contexts embedded within it (its sources, its prompt), but he would insist that this is a second-order activity: piecing together a semblance of meaning from borrowed fragments, not understanding an intended message.1 In Betti's view, the problematic nature of AI texts serves to reassert the importance of the author by showing what is lost when the authorial will is removed.


Paul Ricoeur: Text, Distanciation, and the New State of the Hermeneutic Task


The French philosopher Paul Ricoeur (1913-2005) offers a masterful dialectical approach that mediates between the classical emphasis on the author and the postmodern focus on the reader and language. One of his key contributions is the concept of "distanciation," which describes the semantic autonomy a text gains through the act of writing. Once discourse is written down, its meaning is no longer identical with what the author meant; it is detached from the author's psychology and original context, entering a new life where it can be appropriated by readers in different eras.1 As Ricoeur memorably put it, "The text's career escapes the finite horizon of its author".1
Ricoeur's framework is exceptionally well-suited to handle AI-authored texts. His famous assertion, "What the text says now matters more than what the author meant to say," is strikingly apt for a text that had no author to begin with.1 The absolute distanciation of an AI text—it was never "present" to an author's consciousness—simply makes literal what Ricoeur argued is true for all writing. The absence of a psychological intent clarifies the hermeneutic task, forcing the interpreter to concentrate on the words themselves, the text's internal structure, and the "world of the text" that it projects.1
Ricoeur's balanced method, which incorporates both a "hermeneutics of faith" (an openness to the text's meaning) and a "hermeneutics of suspicion" (a critical unmasking of hidden biases), provides a comprehensive toolkit.1 An interpreter can approach an AI text with suspicion, dissecting how it reproduces ideological clichés or biases from its training data. At the same time, they can approach it with faith, remaining open to the possibility that it might, even by accident, generate a novel metaphor or a narrative configuration that yields insight.1 The final stage of interpretation, appropriation, remains fully operational: the reader can take the meaning of the text—even if it is a composite of cultural commonplaces—and make it their own, using it for self-understanding.1 Ricoeur would likely view AI texts as a "new state of the hermeneutic task," a fascinating test case that ultimately reinforces the power of interpretation to bring forth meaning even from the ostensibly intentionless.1


Jacques Derrida: The Death of the Author (Again) and the Iterability of Meaning


Finally, Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) and his project of deconstruction represent the most radical challenge to traditional hermeneutics. Derrida destabilized the very notions of fixed meaning, authorial authority, and interpretive certainty. Building on Nietzsche and Barthes, he questioned whether a determinate meaning ever exists to be recovered. His concept of iterability is directly relevant: for any sign or text to be meaningful, it must be repeatable in new contexts, even those completely unforeseen by its "source".1 This capacity to function in the radical absence of the author's presence or intent is not a defect of writing but its very condition of possibility.1
When confronted with an AI-authored text, Derrida might wryly smile and say, "I told you so." An AI text is deconstruction made manifest. It is writing with literally no authoritative presence behind it, a perfect dramatization of his thesis that language can circulate and produce effects without an origin.1 The "death of the author" is no longer a theoretical provocation but a concrete reality. This does not make the text meaningless; it simply foregrounds how meaning has always been a function of the play of trace and difference (
différance), not of an originating will.1
For Derrida, hermeneutics without a present author is not only possible; it is what hermeneutics has always been, even if it refused to admit it. The AI text simply strips away the illusion of a central, grounding presence. The interpretive act can proceed as it always has for a deconstructor: by tracing the play of signifiers, looking for internal contradictions, questioning the text's assumptions, and showing how its meaning disseminates and unravels.1 The absence of an author's intention provides even greater freedom for this kind of interpretive play. Derrida would likely see the age of AI-authored texts as a poignant illustration of his philosophy. Hermeneutics, if it is to deal with these texts, must abandon any last vestiges of its "theology of the author" and become a form of deconstruction: attending to how meanings are made and unmade in the endless, centerless play of writing.1
The stark contrast between Emilio Betti on one side and Paul Ricoeur and Jacques Derrida on the other represents a final, seemingly irreconcilable schism in the hermeneutic tradition, a divide that the AI text lays bare. Betti's entire project is predicated on the faithful recovery of an objective meaning that was placed in the text by an authorial mind.1 It is a hermeneutics of excavation. Derrida's project, in contrast, is about demonstrating that meaning is never fully present to be recovered but is always generated in the endless
play of language.1 It is a hermeneutics of dissemination. Ricoeur mediates between these poles, but his concept of distanciation ultimately sides with the text's autonomy over the author's psychology.1
These are not just different methods; they are fundamentally different ontologies of meaning. For Betti, meaning is a substance to be found. For Derrida, meaning is an event, a continuous process of deferral. An AI-generated text cannot be approached through a hermeneutics of recovery, because there is no original meaning-event, no authorial thought, to recover. It can only be approached through a hermeneutics of play, production, or appropriation. The AI text, therefore, acts as a historical endpoint. It renders the Betti-Schleiermacher tradition inapplicable in its purest form and validates the post-authorial turn of Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Derrida as the only viable path forward for interpreting these new forms of text. The AI text does not just challenge hermeneutics; it forces it to complete the evolution it began in the 20th century, definitively leaving behind the ghost of the author and embracing the life of the text and the reader.


Conclusion: A Tradition Ruptured or Reaffirmed?


This genealogical inquiry into the tradition of hermeneutics reveals that it does not offer a single, unified answer to the challenge of AI-authored texts. Instead, it presents a spectrum of responses that exposes the fundamental fault lines within interpretive theory itself.1 The advent of machine authorship acts as a clarifying agent, forcing a confrontation between two opposing conceptions of meaning: one rooted in the human author, the other in the autonomous life of language and tradition.
For the author-centric lineage—represented most strongly by Schleiermacher, Dilthey, and Betti—the absence of a human author constitutes a genuine "rupture." Their hermeneutic projects, which aim to reconstruct an author's creative act, re-experience a lived reality, or recover an objective authorial will, are fundamentally undermined. For these thinkers, an AI text is a "lifeless" object, a "pseudo-text" whose interpretation can only be an incomplete, inferior, or illegitimate act.1
Conversely, for the text- and reader-centric tradition that gained prominence in the 20th century, AI authorship represents a form of "continuity," or even a "vindication." For thinkers like Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Derrida, who had already de-emphasized or deconstructed the author, an AI text is a manageable, and in some ways perfect, test case. It confirms that meaning can arise from the dialogue with tradition (Gadamer), from the semantic autonomy of the text (Ricoeur), or from the endless play of language itself (Derrida).1
The phenomenon of AI authorship, therefore, appears to accelerate the historical trend within hermeneutics away from the Romantic worship of the author and toward the post-intentional models that now dominate the field. It forces the discipline to fully embrace the autonomy of the text and the creative, constructive role of the interpreter.1 This suggests a new hermeneutic imperative for our technological age: a blend of Ricoeur's critical suspicion and Gadamer's dialogical openness. The interpreter of an AI text must be suspicious of its origins—attuned to the biases of its training data and the corporate or ideological interests that may have shaped its construction. At the same time, they must remain open to the possibility that language, even when algorithmically generated, can still participate in the ongoing conversation of human tradition and offer moments of genuine, if unintended, insight. The hermeneutic task shifts from understanding an author to critically and creatively engaging with the disembodied, composite voice of our collective textual world.
