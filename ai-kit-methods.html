    <h1>Methods for Reading AI Texts</h1>

    <p>Traditional hermeneutics faces a crisis with AI-generated texts: there's no human author to reconstruct, no lived experience to recover. But this doesn't make AI texts uninterpretable—it forces us to develop new methods that focus on the text itself and the systems that produced it.</p>

    <h2>The Three Core Problems</h2>
    <p>AI texts present three fundamental interpretive challenges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Author Problem:</strong> No human consciousness lies behind the text</li>
      <li><strong>The Intention Problem:</strong> No deliberate meaning was intended</li>
      <li><strong>The Experience Problem:</strong> No lived reality is being expressed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method 1: Algorithmic Grammatical Analysis</h2>
    <p>Adapt Schleiermacher's "grammatical rail" to focus on the system rather than the language.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Model Architecture:</strong> What type of AI produced this? (GPT, BERT, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Training Data Signatures:</strong> What textual patterns suggest the corpus it learned from?</li>
      <li><strong>Genre Mimicry:</strong> What human text types is it attempting to replicate?</li>
      <li><strong>Prompt Engineering:</strong> How did the input shape the output?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example in Practice</h3>
    <p>When analyzing an AI-generated poem, ask: Does this follow the statistical patterns of 19th-century verse? Are there anachronistic combinations of diction? Does it blend multiple poetic traditions in ways a human poet wouldn't?</p>

    <h2>Method 2: Pattern Psychology (Without the Psyche)</h2>
    <p>Replace Schleiermacher's "psychological rail" with algorithmic signature analysis.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recurring Tics:</strong> What stylistic habits does this model consistently exhibit?</li>
      <li><strong>Deviation Detection:</strong> Where does it break from template responses?</li>
      <li><strong>Compositional Logic:</strong> What organizational principles govern its structure?</li>
      <li><strong>Bias Archaeology:</strong> What cultural assumptions are embedded in its patterns?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method 3: The Hermeneutic Circle for Systems</h2>
    <p>The interpretive circle works differently when the "whole" is an algorithm, not a human mind.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hypothesis Formation:</strong> What kind of system logic could have produced this output?</li>
      <li><strong>Part Analysis:</strong> How do specific phrases or arguments support or challenge that hypothesis?</li>
      <li><strong>Systemic Refinement:</strong> Revise your understanding of the model's patterns</li>
      <li><strong>Iterative Testing:</strong> Apply your refined model to new AI outputs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method 4: Trace Logic and Iterability</h2>
    <p>Following Derrida, focus on how meaning emerges from repetition and context-switching.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Source Tracing:</strong> Can you identify the human texts this output echoes?</li>
      <li><strong>Context Transplantation:</strong> How does moving phrases between contexts change meaning?</li>
      <li><strong>Iterative Stability:</strong> What happens when you prompt the same input multiple times?</li>
      <li><strong>Combinatorial Analysis:</strong> How does the AI recombine existing discourse patterns?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The "As If" Framework</h2>
    <p>When applying traditional methods to AI texts, operate under the methodological fiction of treating the text "as if" it had an author, while remaining conscious that this is a heuristic tool, not a metaphysical claim.</p>

    <h3>How This Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Project a hypothetical unity onto the text for analysis purposes</li>
      <li>Search for organizing principles that could explain its coherence</li>
      <li>Remain alert to where the "author fiction" breaks down</li>
      <li>Use breakdowns as evidence of the text's algorithmic nature</li>
    </ul>
