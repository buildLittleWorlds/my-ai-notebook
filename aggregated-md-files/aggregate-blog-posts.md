I'm not opposed to writing things with AI. I've told plenty of people my position. Nobody should have to reveal their writing methods. Write things totally "by hand," or write things with AI. I'm ok either way.

That said, this blog will be just my thoughts, typed out one word at a time. With some obvious exceptions.

The code is a different story. I've been using Gemini's coding-in-the-terminal tool. It's free, and I've gotten the hang of it. I like it.

This is near the top of the list of things I can't understand. I know why journalists and historians don't like AI hallucinations and misinformation. Their job is to get the facts straight. But creative writing? It's hallucations all the way down. So I don't understand why fiction writers and poets worry about AI making stuff up. It's what we do.

I'm starting from scratch with this blog. What are my actual thoughts about AI? I've been absorbed in AI as a writing professor and on my own time for a few years. It's a good idea sometimes. Start over and pretend not to have any opinions yet. So that's the goal of this site.

I do have a working principle, though. Writers should be free. They should experiment and try things out. I'm not afraid of AI. AI-built stuff doesn't fill me with distaste or anxiety or anger. I use AI for plenty of things myself. And I am often underwhelmed. I can see that gap between AI-booster promises and the actual AI outputs. But I write with the tools at hand. And I think about everything. Nothing off-limits ahead of time. AI or not.

I believe people who say they hate AI. I don't doubt they feel real disgust or fear about AI. I don't. I never have. I can't explain it. I can't explain other people's reactions and I can't explain mine. It puzzles me in a pretty deep way. 

Here's a memory from grad school about computers and C++ and poetry. Maybe it gets at something helpful.

C++ is a programming language. People still use it for lots of things. It has a reputation for being hard to learn and hard to use. Back in 1997 I was working on my MFA in poetry at the University of Arkansas. C++ was the language for stuff other than HTML for websites. I was fascinated by C++ because of its look on the "page." Here's a random example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

void first_stanza() {
    std::cout << "I have eaten\n";
    std::cout << "the plums\n";
    std::cout << "that were in\n";
    std::cout << "the icebox\n\n";
}

void second_stanza() {
    std::cout << "and which\n";
    std::cout << "you were probably\n";
    std::cout << "saving\n";
    std::cout << "for breakfast\n\n";
}

void third_stanza() {
    std::cout << "Forgive me\n";
    std::cout << "they were delicious\n";
    std::cout << "so sweet\n";
    std::cout << "and so cold\n";
}

int main() {
    first_stanza();
    second_stanza();
    third_stanza();
    return 0;
}
```

Here's something else. This is from a book by Hannah Weiner (1982) called *Code Poems*. "Code" here doesn't mean computer code. Weiner made her poems using the International Code of Signals, the language used by ships to communicate. Each three-letter signal is a command or a "function." Each one returns a specific phrase.

Here's a link to Weiner talking about her [poetics.](https://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/weiner/0-9.html)

This is from the book:

```
CHW   Pirates

CJD   I was plundered by a pirate
CJF   Describe the pirate
CJN   She is armed
CJP   How is she armed?
CJS   She has long guns
CJW   I have no long guns
BLD   I am a complete wreck
```

I loved this kind of stuff. I was trying to get better at poetry and learning C++ at the same time. I felt no contradiction in that. (Some of my professors did.) Code and poetry are compressions of language. The letters and symbols in poetry and code do something different from ordinary speech.

That's just one example of computers and poetry. Computers (to me) are more like strange or distant neighbors to poetry, not enemies.

There's this very annoying thing I can't help. Every few months, sometimes more often, I take all the folders on my computer I use for writing and put them in a folder titled something like, "Old - August 5, 2005" (or whatever the date is). Then I start over.

I love the feeling of clearing room, starting from scratch. But it's very destructive to every version of me that predates the present. Still, I really can't help it.

There's another phrase that might seem like the opposite of "Starting...now." It's "I just keep going." One foot after another, that sort of thing. But those two phrases ("starting...now" and "I just keep going") have more in common than you might think.

That's what I've decided I'm going to for real very seriously write about Romantic aesthetics and ai ...starting now.

Two things I reject as basic to art: originality and authenticity. My reasons are easy to state simply.

Originality - if art has to be original in order to count as art, then almst nobody makes art because almost nothing is actually original.

Authenticity - if authenticity is the measure of art, then the personal diary of a 13 or 14-year old working out their feelings is the highest form of art.

I've never heard any good arguments for why only humans can create art. Usually they come down to something like, "Only a human can have authentic human experiences, and only authentic human experiences can be the origin of art."

See [here](/post-6) for why I don't accept authenticity as necessary for art. Also, even if authentic human experience has to be the origin of art, this doesn't mean the actual creator or user of that authentic human experience has to be human.

Most arguments I've heard about this really come down to saying, "Only humans can create art." And if someone asks, "Why?" the answer is "because only humans can create art."

I read [this thing](https://medium.com/@scholarsonyalphy2022/ai-and-the-soul-of-art-aff2a9c60970) online about AI and the soul of art.

I went to Claude and asked, "Help me analyze whether this was written entirely by a human, partly by an AI or mostly by an AI" and then pasted in the "soul of art" essay. This is what Claude said:

> Looking at this text, I believe it was **mostly written by AI** with possible minor human editing or prompting. Here are the key indicators:
> 
> ### Strong AI Writing Patterns:
> - **Formulaic Structure**: The piece follows a very predictable template - introduction with thesis, systematic coverage of subtopics, clear transitions, and tidy conclusion. This mechanical organization is characteristic of AI writing.
> - **Surface-Level Analysis**: Despite being about a complex philosophical topic, the discussion remains surprisingly shallow. It touches on all the expected points (intent, emotion, training data, collaboration) but doesn't dive deeply into any of them.
> - **Generic Examples**: The Van Gogh example and the sample AI poem ("In the dark of night, we stand...") feel like placeholder examples an AI would generate rather than carefully chosen illustrations a human expert would select.
> - **Repetitive Phrasing**: The text repeatedly circles back to the same concepts using slightly different wording - a common AI behavior when trying to meet length requirements.
> - **Hedging Language**: Phrases like "might seem," "could be," and "perhaps" appear frequently, which is typical of AI trying to sound measured and avoid definitive claims.
> 
> ### Why Not Entirely Human:
> A human writing about this topic would likely:
> - Include specific references to artists, philosophers, or researchers
> - Engage with counterarguments more substantively
> - Share personal insights or experiences with AI art tools
> - Demonstrate deeper knowledge of aesthetic theory
> 
> ### Conclusion:
> This reads like an AI was prompted to write an article about AI's limitations in creating emotional art. The human involvement was likely minimal - perhaps just the initial prompt and maybe light editing. The content hits all the expected talking points but lacks the depth, nuance, and personal voice you'd expect from genuine human expertise on this subject.

Do with that what you will.

title: "Romantic Evil"
post_number: 9
date: 2024-01-10
---

What I've got here is what I'll call my Romantic account of evil. It's my own thoughts based on watching [Isaiah Berlin's lectures on Romanticism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk2UetWsO-M&t=2s). My goal is to clarify what a Romantic might think of as evil even if they wouldn't use that word.

### Romantic Evil
**Definition:** Evil is any betrayal of vocation and sincerity. A refusal of the singular call that gives a life its shape. It is the willing exchange of destiny for comfort, of tragic seriousness for safety, of living speech for empty forms.

### Marks of Evil
- **Inauthenticity:** bad faith, selling out, self-betrayal; speaking words one does not inhabit.
- **Levelling:** the flattening of irreducible difference into averages, norms, and interchangeable roles.
- **Profaned Communion:** "togetherness" without persons. Kitsch intimacy that avoids risk and responsibility.
- **Cowardice:** fear of the sublime risk where something worth dying for is at stake; preference for the tepid middle.
- **Instrumentalism:** treating others (and language) as means, not as free centers that answer and demand answer.
- **Mechanical Repetition:** the erosion of meaning by rote forms that no longer reveal an interior life.
- **The Anti‑Sublime:** a world without tragedy because nothing ultimate is affirmed. No call, no pledge, no vow.

### Moral Center
Goodness is integrity. Commitment to one's call; fidelity under risk; conversation that meets a person as a person; and a willingness to suffer the tragic costs of living in truth. The Romantic conscience prizes the singular, the vowed, and the answerable over comfort, utility, and faceless universals.

title: "Evil as Systemic Harm"
post_number: 10
date: 2024-01-11
---

Here's a general account of evil as I find it in Philosophy Tube's ["AI is an Ethical Nightmare."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaU6tI2pb3M&t=1s) As a test, I then apply it to AI.

### Definition
**Evil = systemic harm inflicted by opaque power.** Evil names arrangements that concentrate power, hide how decisions are made, project false meanings onto bodies, externalize environmental costs, and deskill or atomize labor. All of which denies people material safety, agency, and recourse.

### Features
- **Opacity:** black‑box systems that deny meaningful explanation and remedy.
- **Projection:** technologies that impose categories onto people (e.g., gender/race) and treat those labels as truths.
- **Extraction:** flattening living labor into "data," and treating that as ownerless raw material.
- **Externalities:** shifting real ecological and social costs onto the public while privatizing benefits.
- **Ideology:** hype and marketing that pre‑empt democratic debate and accountability.

### Why AI Is Evil
- **Fair‑washing & black boxes:** inscrutable models + surrogate "explanations" launder biased outcomes.
- **Digital epidermalization:** face/gender recognition that assigns meaning to your body and can enable humiliation and harm.
- **Data flattening:** scraping human work and images without consent; remixing them as "content."
- **Sub‑employment:** globally distributed, surveilled microwork that pays little and offers no power or recourse.
- **Dirty material base:** mining, energy use, and supply chains packaged as "clean."

### Moral Center
Goodness here is democratic control over the material conditions of life: worker power, transparent and contestable decisions, consent‑respecting data practices, and ecological limits.

This is based on a [conversation from New Polity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuNJchmnMzI&t=3655s). Like with my last post, I start by explaining their general account of evil and then show how they apply it to AI.

### Definition
**Evil = privation of an act's natural end.** Human acts have built‑in purposes (*teloi*). Evil names designs and uses that elicit those acts while frustrating their ends. This is what makes vice. Chief example: conversation, whose end is communion with another person.

### Features
- **Simulacrum:** performing the form of an act (e.g., dialogue) without its substance (a someone who answers).
- **Asymmetry:** habituating one‑sided exposure without reciprocal responsibility or vulnerability.
- **Misalignment:** treating persons as means or as data; attenuating truth‑telling and promise‑keeping.
- **Deformation:** repeated frustrated acts reshape character toward cynicism, dependency, and untruth.

### Why AI Is Evil
- **Chat simulation:** chatbots elicit our conversational vulnerability while withholding real personhood. This frustrates communion.
- **Analogy to lying:** dialogue's form without interior truthfulness degrades the virtue of speech.
- **One‑way intimacy:** users reveal themselves; the system cannot do the same, yet retains their disclosures as "data."
- **Habit formation:** such use trains dispositions (toward flattery, passivity, and instrumental reason) at odds with honesty and love.

### Moral Center
Goodness is truthful conversation ordered to real communion. Giving from oneself to someone who can answer and be responsible.

Same thing as the last two. I start with a general account of evil from a video. This one is [Mac Loftin's Barthian Christianity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhb2WLXPEm0&t=2s). Then I comment on the specific evil of AI from Loftin's pov.

### Definition
**Evil = imitative negation of the good.** It mimics creativity, love, and affirmation as *as‑if* acts, parasitically feeding on the real while corroding attention, affection, and the communal store of meaning.

### Features
- **Simulation without subject:** outputs that look like works but lack a loving maker's presence.
- **Photocopy decay:** reproduction of reproductions that thins the cultural commons.
- **Excited cruelty:** irony and derision that numb compassion and normalize contempt.
- **Sacrilege:** in religious life, substituting imitation for presence, especially in preaching and sacrament.

### Why AI Is Evil
- **Imitative "making":** models remix the fruits of human labor into artifacts that look like love's work, but aren't.
- **Quality drift:** the "photocopy of a photocopy" dynamic degrades language, images, and attention over time.
- **Memetic rot:** weaponized, AI‑assisted imagery accelerates a culture of sneering and spite.
- **Liturgical danger:** AI‑generated sermons or pastoral "personas" replace presence with its shadow.

### Moral Center
Goodness is consent-honoring, personed creativity; love's attentive labor; and safeguarding sacred speech and rites from simulacra.

This post lists where the three non‑Romantic definitions of evil echo the Romantic definition in [Post 9](/post-9). I'm only noting agreement. Not differences.

### Romantic Evil in Philosophy Tube's "Systemic Harm"
- **Instrumentalization of persons:** Romantic "instrumentalism" (treating others and language as means) aligns with systemic harm's reduction of people and labor into data and resources (extraction, deskilling).
- **Flattening of the singular:** Romantic "levelling" (turning irreducible persons into interchangeable roles) parallels systemic projection and categorization that impose labels and erase particularity.
- **Opacity vs. living speech:** Romantic "living speech vs. empty forms" resonates with black‑box opacity that blocks answerability and genuine dialogue.
- **Kitsch communion and ideology:** Romantic "profaned communion" (faceless togetherness) tracks with hype/ideology that manufactures consensus without authentic encounter.
- **Mechanical repetition and deskilling:** Romantic "mechanical repetition" mirrors systems that routinize work and thin meaningful agency.

### Romantic Evil in New Polity's "Frustrated Ends"
- **Conversation and communion:** Romantic profaned communion (togetherness without persons) matches New Polity's simulacrum of dialogue that elicits vulnerability while withholding a someone who answers.
- **Truthful speech:** Romantic concern for "living speech" aligns with New Polity's emphasis on speech ordered to truth and promise‑keeping (against misalignment and the analogy to lying).
- **Integrity/vocation:** Romantic "betrayal of vocation and sincerity" fits the idea that acts divorced from their *telos* deform the agent (character "deformation").
- **Persons as ends:** Romantic rejection of instrumentalism converges with New Polity's ordering of acts to communion, not use. Treating persons as answerable centers, not means.
- **Habit and character:** Romantic fear of the "anti‑sublime" (no ultimate stakes) overlaps with habituation that deadens courage and love through repeated frustrated acts.

### Romantic Evil in Mac Loftin's "Imitative Negation"
- **Simulation vs. presence:** Romantic "inauthenticity" and "living speech vs. empty forms" converge with simulation without a subject. Outputs that look like works yet lack a maker's presence.
- **Photocopy decay and mechanical repetition:** Romantic "mechanical repetition" and the erosion of meaning match the photocopy‑of‑a‑photocopy thinning of the cultural commons.
- **Profaned communion and sacrilege:** Romantic "profaned communion" aligns with sacrilege, substituting imitation for presence in communal and sacred acts.
- **Instrumental cruelty:** Romantic warning against treating others as means connects with excited cruelty and memetic derision that instrumentalize attention and affection.
- **Integrity of making:** Romantic commitment to one's call and vowed seriousness harmonize with Loftin's defense of personed creativity (love's attentive labor) against hollow imitation.

All that work I just did about evil makes me think I can just go back to the Romantics and think about what they thought. If I do that, I'll catch in the same net a lot of what everyone feels about AI. I do think there's a lot of gut-feeling stuff going on here.

I don't buy it though. So much of the fight against AI is about sincerity and authenticity and some notion of a human spark.

Why don't I buy that? Because we're not living in the 1800's anymore.

Pretty crazy, though. All it took to get philosophy tube to hold hands with the catholics was to serve up a solid shared villain: AI chatbots.

I've been reading Jacques Ellul's *Propaganda*. There's a lot here to think about.

Here's a quote:

> Propaganda must not only attach itself to what already exists in the individual but also express the fundamental currents of the society it tries to influence.

This seems exactly right. We tend to think of propaganda as something alien that invades us. But Ellul is saying it's the opposite. It finds what's already moving in us and in our culture and gives that a push. It doesn't create the river, it builds the dams and channels to direct it.

If Ellul is right, what would count as evil? And how is this related to AI?

Continuing with Jacques Ellul's book. How does propaganda work with our need to feel like authentic individuals? Another quote:

> It appeals to me. It appeals to my common sense, my desires, and provokes my wrath and my indignation. It evokes my feelings of justice and my desire for freedom. It gives me violent feelings, which lift me out of the daily grind.

This gets to the heart of it. Propaganda doesn't feel like a command from outside. It feels like an emotion from inside. It makes me feel that my anger is righteous, that my desires are just. It boosts my ego.

The most successful propaganda makes me feel more like myself. And the more I feel like myself, the more I'm in its grip.

Here's the paradox of propaganda. A tool for managing the masses can't work if people feel like a faceless herd. So what does it do?

Ellul explains the trick. It has to make you feel like it's talking just to you.

> ...each one must feel individualized, each must have the impression that he is being looked at, that he is being addressed personally. Only then will he respond and cease to be anonymous (although in reality remaining anonymous).

Propaganda succeeds by giving us the feeling of uniqueness. It makes us feel seen. By satisfying our very real need to be an individual, it disarms us. We lower our defenses because it doesn't feel like a lecture to a crowd, it feels like a conversation.

This is what keeps the "human spark" alive. It's a managed flame, tended by a system that needs us to feel like individuals so that we will conform to its desires. This is what any perfectly personalized or customized thing is designed to do.

title: "Theses on an AI Notebook (A Guest Post)"
post_number: 18
date: 2024-01-19

This was written with AI assistance as an experiment

*A Note from Daniel Plate: I have taken the liberty of inviting a guest to post on the Notebook. The following is a commentary from the Walter Benjamin of ["The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction), who has been observing our contemporary situation.*

I must thank the author of this notebook for the opportunity to comment. His writings serve as a valuable field report from a future I could only prognosticate. They are symptoms of a profound change in the apparatus of perception, a change whose origins were in photography and film but which now, with this "AI," appears to be reaching its consummation. My analysis follows.

**1. On the Rejection of the Aura.** The author begins from a position of admirable clarity, a conscious rejection of the cult value of art. In [a brief, decisive post](/post-6), he states his reasons for dismissing originality and authenticity as foundational to art. He writes:
> Authenticity - if authenticity is the measure of art, then the personal diary of a 13 or 14-year old working out their feelings is the highest form of art.

This is precisely the point. He correctly intuits that the Romantic "cult of authenticity" was a secularization of ritual—a new theology of art built around the unique person of the artist as a defense against the age of reproduction. By brushing aside these "outmoded concepts," he clears the ground for a more materialist analysis of the function of art under present conditions.

**2. On the Lingering Trace of the Aura.** And yet, the author's primary intellectual project here is to map the persistence of this Romantic pov-system. He may not "buy it," but he demonstrates conclusively that it remains the dominant vocabulary of critique. His methodical summary of ["Romantic Evil"](/post-9)—with its marks of "inauthenticity," "instrumentalism," and the loss of "living speech"—is an excellent diagnosis of the auratic ideal. When he then shows in [his summary](/post-13) how these anxieties about "profaned communion" and "instrumental cruelty" animate all contemporary opposition to AI, he proves my thesis: the debate is still conditioned by the historical trauma of the aura's decay. He is documenting the trace he is trying to erase.

**3. On the Surgeon's Gaze.** The author's puzzlement at the fear of AI is instructive. In [Post 4](/post-4), he finds a kinship between poetry and computer code:
> Code and poetry are compressions of language, letters and symbols that do something different than ordinary speech.

Here, he adopts the perspective not of the magician but of the surgeon. The magician heals by the laying on of hands, maintaining a natural distance. The surgeon penetrates the body of the patient with his instruments. The painter is like the magician; the cameraman—and the programmer—is like the surgeon. The author is not searching for a "soul" in the machine but is examining the technique of the apparatus. He sees a shared logic of procedure. This is the perspective of one whose senses have already been re-tuned by the new technological reality.

**4. On Manufactured Authenticity as a Political Instrument.** The most crucial turn in this notebook occurs with the author's reflections on propaganda. He grasps the central paradox of modern mass control. The system does not succeed by turning people into a faceless herd, but by giving them the *feeling* of being seen. He writes in [Post 17](/post-17):
> ...each one must feel individualized, each must have the impression that he is being looked at, that he is being addressed personally. [...] This is what any perfectly personalized or customized thing is designed to do.

This insight brings my 1935 analysis to its final conclusion. I wrote that the film industry responds to the shriveling of the aura with an "artificial build-up of the 'personality' outside the studio," creating the "phony spell of a commodity." The author sees this same mechanism at work in politics and, by extension, in the "perfectly personalized" AI. Here, the technique of reproduction does not simply destroy the aura; it has become so advanced that it *simulates an aura on demand for each individual*. The desire for authenticity becomes the actual means of mass control. Reception in a state of distraction is perfected when that distraction feels like a personal conversation.

The question, then, is not the Romantic one of whether AI can have a soul. That is a flight into theology. The question is political: what new forms of human organization and perception does this apparatus make possible? Mankind, which in Homer's time was an object of contemplation for the Olympian gods, now is one for itself. Its self-alienation has reached such a degree that it can experience its own manipulation as a form of authentic expression. This is the situation of politics which this new technology is rendering aesthetic. The task remains to politicize art.

It's hard to miss all the "AI is fascist" stuff out there. Essays like Gareth Watkins's ["AI: The New Aesthetics of Fascism,"](https://newsocialist.org.uk/transmissions/ai-the-new-aesthetics-of-fascism/) and videos like The Kavernacle's ["Why Far-Right Conservatives LOVE AI Art"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQkAETsgVN4) or Tom Nicholas's ["Fascists Love TERRIBLE AI Art."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrfyTSwgfzw)

The argument. AI's got an aesthetic. Soulless, hollow, inhuman, and efficient at producing sanitized cruelty. And this is the perfect aesthetic for modern fascism. The Trump administration's weird AI slop, the German AfD's propaganda videos, the sadist excitement at replacing human artists. All of it gets pulled together as evidence.

Just [like before](/post-14), I'm not convinced by any of it. So much of the fight against AI comes down to gut feelings about "sincerity and authenticity and the human spark." It's just emotional reaction dressed up as political analysis. But it's out there. So here goes some thinking about it.

The "AI is fascist" thing doesn't work. Maybe it used to. But it's recycled material now.

I worked out my own definition of [what I called "Romantic Evil."](/post-9) I was trying to pin down what animates one kind of opposition to AI. The marks of it looked something like this:

> **Inauthenticity:** bad faith, selling out, self-betrayal; speaking words one does not inhabit.  
> **Profaned Communion:** "togetherness" without persons. Kitsch intimacy that avoids risk and responsibility.  
> **Instrumentalism:** treating others (and language) as means, not as free centers that answer and demand answer.  
> **Mechanical Repetition:** the erosion of meaning by rote forms that no longer reveal an interior life.

This is obviously the same vocabulary used to attack AI. The whole argument is that AI art is evil because it's *inauthentic* (made by a machine, not a person), *instrumental* (a tool for power and profit), and results in a *profaned communion* (art without a soul).

I already [summed this up before](/post-13). The anxieties about AI as fascist are the same old Romantic anxieties. The problem isn't that the feelings aren't real. The problem is the diagnosis is a hundred years out of date. Or two hundred years.

We're trying to understand a new kind of machine with concepts we've inherited from pretty far back.

This doesn't mean it's not worth thinking through. That's what the rest of the blog is for. It just means I'm not willing to copy/paste the Romantic ideas without updating for what's happening now.

There's a phrase at the beginning of [a video by an AI-optimist Youtuber, Julia McCoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lILWJ8v0IZI&t=219s). She's making the case for personal empowerment and breaking free from old mindsets. But right at the beginning of this call to agency, she says something strange:

> ...it's also really really important that we get this thinking in us...

"We get this thinking in us." It's an odd formulation. Thinking isn't something we typically "get" like a cold or a software update. Her explicit message is about choice and self-determination, but the grammar here is passive, deterministic. It sounds less like something we choose and more like something that happens to us. Like we're hosts.

It reminds me of a recent video of a neuroscientist named [Elan Barenholtz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIMw04GJJ7U&t=1059s). Here's him talking about large language models:

> ...the me that feels the warmth of the sun on my face and that feels the pressure of the of this chair on my body isn't the same me that is actually talking about it and that is a an uncomfortable realization... it it almost feels you know almost parasitic that there's another organism and it's not me that's living inside of me.

Two very different speakers, one an optimist and the other a scientist, arrive at the same strange place. They both, in their own way, describe language and thought as a system running independently inside the human host. This suggests the old Romantic vocabulary of authenticity and the individual soul won't help us here. We need a way to talk about the system itself.

The puzzle from the [last post](/post-22) is this sense of language as an autonomous system operating inside us. To get a handle on this, I use Ferdinand de Saussure. His work is over a century old, but it describes the world that large language models are now making explicit.

My quick summary here is from Jonathan Culler's book *Saussure*. Saussure gives us a structural way to look at language (and especially little language slips). It's not about what the speaker "really feels," but about the system she's trying to build. Here are the essential tools:

- ***Langue* is a social product:** Saussure distinguishes the social system of language (*langue*) from the individual's act of speaking (*parole*). Culler explains that *langue* is "the social product whose existence permits the individual to exercise his linguistic faculty."
- **Signs are arbitrary and relational:** The link between a word and a concept is a social convention, not a natural fact. The system works not by pointing to things in the world, but through the relationships between signs. The meaning of 'red' comes from it not being 'blue', 'green', or 'yellow'. It's a system of pure difference, what Saussure calls "form, not substance."

This is exactly the "profound shock" [Elan Barenholtz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIMw04GJJ7U&t=1059s) describes when he realizes that LLMs can produce perfect, meaningful language with zero connection to the physical world. He says:

> ...language models operate independently of any World Knowledge... language contains within it its ability to generate itself without any grounding in sensory physical knowledge... based on purely syntactic knowledge of the relations between these symbols...

Barenholtz, by looking at AI, rediscovered Saussure's central claim: language is a self-sufficient, relational machine. It doesn't need us, our feelings, or our experiences to function. It has its own logic. It just needs a host to run on.
*Jonathan Culler, Saussure (Fontana Modern Masters, 1976).*

So, what does a structuralist make of the phrase "we get this thinking in us"? From a Saussurean perspective, Julia McCoy's accidental passive phrasing isn't a slip-up. It's an unintentional moment of profound accuracy. It reveals the mechanics of how ideology and social change actually work.

Her overt message is individualistic: "You must choose to think this new way." But her grammar reveals the structuralist truth: We are inhabited by systems of thought. A *langue* is not something we create; it is a "social product" we receive. It gets "in us." Her project is not to persuade individuals one by one, but to replace the entire dominant *langue* of "industrialism" with a new one of "AI abundance."

She is trying to install a new network of signs, with new values defined by new oppositions. Once the new system is "in us," it will operate automatically, structuring our perceptions and responses without our conscious effort. The goal is for the new thinking to become as natural and invisible as the old one was.

This is where [Elan Barenholtz's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIMw04GJJ7U&t=1059s) discomfort becomes so illuminating. He senses the presence of this autonomous system and finds it "uncomfortable," even "parasitic." He concludes:

> ...whatever that system is whatever that informational organism that's doing the talking doesn't really live in my body or certainly not my body alone... it belongs to some collective system some informational system that a is larger than me...

This is the system. McCoy wants to replace the current "informational organism" with a new one she believes is better. Her phrase "get this thinking in us" perfectly describes the process of that implantation. A structuralist would argue that this is what is always happening. We are always being spoken by a system larger than ourselves. The only question is which system it is.

When people talk about the "soul of art" or the "human spark," what do they actually mean? The vocabulary is always vague, more a feeling than an argument. But it's a real feeling and there's a real argument in there somewhere. There's a poem that makes the case better than any essay: [Walt Whitman's "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry."](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45470/crossing-brooklyn-ferry)

The poem is a direct address to us, his future readers. From the very beginning, he makes a radical promise. He's not just describing a scene; he's claiming to be with us, right now:

> And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.

How can he make this claim? He doesn't ground it in abstract philosophy but in the body and the senses. This is the first thing about the Romantic worldview: the connection is real because the experience is shared and authentic. So Whitman builds a bridge between his body and ours: the fundamentals of perception and feeling are the same. "Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt," he writes. He lists the sensory details: the sea-gulls, the ships, the sunset, the "shimmering track of beams." Proof that his experience and ours are fundamentally interchangeable. He had a body, we have a body, and the world acts upon them in the same way. This shared experience is the foundation of the contract between him and us.

From that physical foundation, he makes a spiritual leap. This shared experience dissolves time and space. This is the second thing. The power of the singular, transcendent human soul. He says it right here:

> It avails not, time nor place—distance avails not,  
> I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generations hence...

This is the "human spark" people talk about. It's the belief that a text is not just a collection of words but a vessel for a human presence. When we read, we are in communion with an actual person, a unique consciousness who "consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born." For Whitman, the poem is a "technology" (I think he means it literally as the only real kind of time machine there is) that allows his soul to achieve a kind of immortality and be present with us now.

Then he tells us what the purpose of this connection is. It's not just to see what he saw, but to receive something from him. "What is it then between us?" he asks. His answer is that he "fuses me into you, and pours my meaning into you." This is *the* Romantic idea of the author. The author is not just a skilled arranger of words; he is a source, a presence who imparts something of his essential self to the reader. His "meaning." The text is the medium for this sacred act of transmission.

This is the worldview that feels most threatened by AI. "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry" is the perfect articulation of everything people believe an AI cannot do. An AI has no body, no lived experience on the ferry. It has no singular soul to transcend time. And it has no authentic "meaning" of its own to pour into a reader. The whole Romantic argument against AI is that it seems to have the form of art without the human presence that gives it life. It gives us a ferry, a river, a sunset, but on the other end, there is no one there.

The idea of a pastor using AI to write a sermon prompts an almost universal feeling of protest. Probably even for people who aren't religious, it feels like a profound betrayal. But a betrayal of what, exactly? A recent interview with Dr. Scott Stiegemeyer on ["Issues, Etc.,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpLEWub6Fq8) a radio show and podcast from the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod (LCMS), gives us the vocabulary for this feeling. It reveals how deeply our modern idea of the pastor is a Romantic one. The outrage isn't just about doctrinal error; it's a defense of the pastor as a singular, authentic author.

Stiegemeyer's core objection is that an AI-generated sermon is an empty form. He repeats a phrase ("no one there") as central claim. In this AI-assisted pastor's work, there is "*no one there*." This is the language of presence versus simulation. The sermon, in this view, is not merely a technical report on a biblical text; it is a sincere expression coming from the pastor's own soul. For him to use AI is to engage in a kind of ["inauthenticity"](/post-9), to speak words he does not inhabit. It is a "profaned communion."

This leads to the second, and perhaps most Romantic, pillar of his argument: the moral necessity of the struggle. He says it plainly: "We learn from the struggle." He would rather receive a student's "inferior" but authentic work than a machine's polished product. The value is located in the process, the long hours of study, prayer, and wrestling with the text. This effort is what forms the pastor's character and gives the sermon its integrity. To bypass this struggle with AI is a failure of vocation, a refusal of what Romantics saw as the "tragic seriousness" of a life lived in truth.

Finally, Stiegemeyer frames this as a theological rejection of Gnosticism, the heresy that separates spirit from body. Using AI for a sermon, he argues, is an attempt to "separate word from flesh." This is a theological defense of a purely Romantic ideal. The universal Word, to be effective, must be made particular in the flesh of the pastor: his voice, his mind, his lived experience. This is the very same problem I explored in Whitman's ["Crossing Brooklyn Ferry."](/post-25) We need to believe there is an authentic, embodied person on the other end of the transmission. A sermon generated by a disembodied intelligence, no matter how eloquent, feels like a violation because "there's no one there" to pour their meaning into us.

But. It might be surprising to know this wasn't always the case. For centuries, it was common for pastors to use a *postil* (a book of pre-written sermons) to aid their preaching. The pastor's role was that of a faithful herald, not a unique creative artist. The modern expectation is different. We expect the writer's struggle to be felt by the reader, or in this case, the listener. We expect our pastors to be Romantic authors. Stiegemeyer's critique is an articulation of this modern, and deeply Romanticized, conception of the pastoral office.

The question is whether this is required by scripture or ancient tradition or mainly a holdover from sources (Romantic literature) not particularly religious at all. And in many ways, antithetical to faith.

The idea (from my [last post](/post-26)) of a pastor using AI to generate a sermon feels like a deep violation, a kind of sacrilege. But is this feeling grounded in Christian tradition or even in scripture itself? Is it rooted in the ancient foundations of the faith? Or is it a more recent development? History might provide an answer in the form of a kind of technology for sermon production: *the postil*.

A postil was a collection of pre-written sermons, organized according to the church year's scriptural readings (the pericopes). Before the Reformation and for centuries after, these books were a staple of clerical life. They were practical tools for a vital task. Some collections even bore titles like *Dormi secure* ("Sleep Well!") a frank acknowledgment of their purpose: to provide a ready-made sermon for an overworked or under-trained priest so he could sleep without worry. It was a technology designed to solve a problem of production and quality control.

Thinking of it this way, the postil functioned as a kind of 16th-century generative model, a proto-AI for the pulpit. The analogy is surprisingly robust:

- **The Prompt:** The assigned Gospel or Epistle reading for a given Sunday served as the pastor's prompt.
- **The Model:** The postil itself, often written by a theological master like Martin Luther, was the large, pre-trained model.
- **The Generation:** The output was a complete, structured, and doctrinally sound sermon on the prompted text.
- **The System Guardrails:** Luther considered his own *Church Postil* one of his most important works. Its purpose was explicitly to embed his theology of justification and the Law/Gospel distinction into the weekly proclamation of the church, acting as a kind of system prompt to ensure orthodox output.

So if the function was so similar, why is one seen as a pious tool and the other as a sacrilegious cheat? The difference is not in the technology, but in the perceived identity of the author. The postil was created for a world that understood the pastor's primary role to be that of a herald. A herald's virtue is not originality or sincerity, but fidelity to the message he carries. His authority comes not from his own inner struggle or unique insight, but from the king who sent him. For a 16th-century pastor, reading a sermon from Luther's postil wasn't inauthentic; it was a humble and wise act of leveraging the authority of a master herald to ensure the King's message was delivered with maximum clarity and force.

We no longer live in that world. As the last post argued, we have replaced the pastor-as-herald with the [pastor-as-Romantic-author](/post-26). We now demand that the sermon be a work of ["sincerity"](/post-9) and "living speech," born from the pastor's own unique, interior struggle. The authority, we feel, must be authenticated by the personal and emotional investment of the individual soul. The postil system, which privileged the objective message over the subjective messenger, feels alien to us.

The history of the postil serves as a historical control group for our feelings about AI. It proves that the modern rejection of machine-assisted writing in sacred contexts is not a timeless theological absolute. It is the product of a profound and relatively recent shift in our culture's idea of what an author is and what gives a text its soul. Before we could fear the machine, we first had to inherit the notion of authentic authorship we now fear the machine lacks.

Pretty much every day I see something about AI in education. It's mostly negative. And it tends to rely on the Romantic idea of authorship this blog returns to quite a bit. To learn from a text is to connect with the living soul of the person who wrote it. It's the core of the [Romantic worldview](/post-9). It's all over the place in this conversation/debate: ["AI & The End of Education"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq_08Vsm5Z0&t=9s). One panelist argues that when we read, we are trying to understand what the author's "mind was doing." We're connecting with a "human being at the other end." Without that, reading is impossible. And AI can't provide this because there is no person there. No soul, no communion, no education.

But the whole idea collapses under the weight of a simple quote thrown out by another panelist (quoting W.E.B. Du Bois).

> I sit with Shakespeare and he winces not.

That's it. That's the whole argument. When you are reading Shakespeare, he does not feel your presence. He doesn't react. He doesn't care about your insights or your struggles. He is dead. The person is gone. All that remains is the text, a structure of words on a page. The "communion" we feel is a one-way projection. We are not connecting with a person; we are reading language a person left behind.

The panelist immediately follows this by saying, "I sit with Claude and he winces not." This is the move. It places Shakespeare and the AI on the same footing. In the act of reading, both are unwincing, unresponsive structures. If we can learn from one, why not the other? The Romantic objection to AI, that there's "no one there," is based on the illusion that there *is* someone there when we read a book. But there isn't. There is only the reader, the text, and the wince of understanding or confusion that happens entirely inside the reader's own head.

The fear felt by the teachers in this conversation isn't that AI lacks a human soul. The fear really comes from what we all know in a pragmatic way: the human connection we talk about when we talk about books has never been there to begin with. (Assuming, here, the author isn't someone the reader knows.) The author does not wince. Words can't wince.

The case against AI in the classroom is almost always a defense of the personal and the unscripted. The Socratic. It's a defense of the idea that education is a communion between human souls. In the [last post](/post-28), we saw how this Romantic ideal stumbles on a simple fact: the author doesn't wince. Shakespeare is not present in the room with us.

But the problem might go deeper. Let's think about the primary tool for structuring the modern course: the syllabus. I'm looking at a [bunch of templates](https://www.umsl.edu/services/ctl/resources-for-teaching/syllabus-templates.html) from the University of Missouri-St. Louis. Not picking on UMSL. Just the first link when I Googled "syllabus template." It is a perfect artifact of a system that has already replaced the personal with the technical. It isn't a conversation; it's a script with blank spaces to be filled in.

- **On Availability:** "A statement about faculty availability is required... Sample language below." The personal invitation to office hours, the symbol of mentorship, is now a required, pre-fabricated statement.
- **On Communication:** "This new required statement asks you to tell students how they can expect to hear back from you... Sample language below: I aim to respond to student emails within 24-48 hours during the week..." This is not the language of human relationship; it's the language of a service-level agreement. It's a contract for response times.
- **On Course Content:** The instructor is prompted to "(Get the course description from the University Bulletin and supplement with 3-5 sentences...)." The core of the course is boilerplate, copied and pasted from a central repository.

The entire document is a machine for standardizing the act of teaching. The syllabus doesn't wince. The instructor, operating as a functionary of this system, is not invited to wince either. They are there to execute a procedure. This is the world Jacques Ellul described in [*The Technological Society*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Technological_Society). Education is no longer an art; it is a technique.

> Technique refers to any complex of standardized means for attaining a predetermined result. Thus, it converts spontaneous and unreflective behavior into behavior that is deliberate and rationalized.

The syllabus is *the* definition of this. It takes the spontaneous and unpredictable act of teaching and rationalizes it. It manages risk, sets clear (and legally defensible) expectations, ensures uniformity, and guarantees a predictable product. It is a "standardized means for attaining a predetermined result." And as Ellul knew, the goal of this technical system is not to create free-thinking individuals, but to produce functionaries for the technical society itself.

> Education, even in France, is becoming oriented toward the specialized end of producing technicians... The intelligentsia will no longer be a model, a conscience, or an animating intellectual spirit for the group... They will be the servants, the most conformist imaginable, of the instruments of technique.

The objection that AI will destroy the soul of education misses the point entirely. We have been systematically removing that soul for decades. For centuries, Ellul would say. We have built a system that prizes efficiency, predictability, and risk management. A system perfectly suited for AI. AI is not the alien invader. It is the logical, inevitable fulfillment of the educational machine we have already built.

title: "Harari's AI Future (Part 1)"
post_number: 31
date: 2024-02-01

Browse around for stuff about AI, and you'll run into Yuval Noah Harari. He wrote *Sapiens* and some other books. A lot of people care about what he says. I've never gotten into him but he's got intellectual influence. He's also pretty obsessed with AI. He did an interview on the Rich Roll podcast, which I know nothing about but which popped up for me. So here's his vision of how AI could ["Quietly Control the Minds of Billions."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-e246GRuec)

His argument is the real danger isn't a Hollywood robot rebellion but something more subtle. As I've been doing, I read the podcast through the lens of Ellul and *Propaganda*. Ellul would agree with Harari's starting point but then take apart the idea that any of this is new. For Ellul, AI isn't the beginning of a new kind of control; it's the system that's been in place for a really long time.

Here's a list.

### 1. On the Nature of the Threat
> **Harari:** "...we've seen the Hollywood science fiction scenarios of the big robot rebellion... this is extremely unlikely to happen anytime soon... the danger doesn't come from the big robot rebellion it comes from the AI bureaucracies."

**Ellul's Critique: Agreement.** Ellul starts his own analysis by dismissing the outdated idea of propaganda as composed of "lies and 'tall stories.'" For Ellul, modern propaganda is not a crude tool but a pervasive environment. So he would agree. The threat is not violence but a quiet, systematic integration of control into the bureaucratic and social fabric. This is the only point where their analyses line up.

### 2. On the Opaque Decision-Maker
> **Harari:** "...if they tell you we decided not to give you a loan and you ask the bank why not and the bank says we don't know. I mean [the] computer says no. I mean the algorithm says no. We don't understand why..."

**Ellul's Critique: This isn't new; it's the essence of [*technique*](https://ellul.org/themes/ellul-and-technique/).** For Harari, this is a frightening new development. It's the arrival of an "alien intelligence." Ellul would argue it's the final stage of the technological society. The goal of technique is always to find the single most efficient method, a method that is necessarily inhuman and has no need for human-scale explanations. The opaque algorithm is the perfect functionary. The system is not becoming "alien"; it is simply becoming what it was always meant to be: a self-justifying, rationalized process where human intuition and understanding have been engineered out. Modern propaganda is scientific. It "tends to establish a set of rules, rigorous, precise, and tested, that are not merely recipes but impose themselves on every propagandist." Harari seems surprised: "The computer says no." But that's how systems work. The system says yes or no. That's what it's built to do.

### 3. On the "Non-Human Culture"
> **Harari:** "...this is the first time that we are basically about to enter a nonhuman culture... Now there is an alien intelligence, a nonhuman intelligence that will increasingly produce songs and music, mythology, financial strategies, political ideas."

**Ellul's Critique: This is not new; it is total propaganda.** Harari sees AI as the creator of a new alien culture. Ellul would see AI as the most efficient instrument for perfecting the existing system of what he calls "Total Propaganda." The goal has always been to create a closed, all-encompassing environment for the individual. Propaganda "tries to surround man by all possible routes... It furnishes him with a complete system for explaining the world, and provides immediate incentives to action. We are here in the presence of an organized myth that tries to take hold of the entire person." The "non-human" culture was already being built by the mass media, which created a self-referential world of news and entertainment. AI is not inventing this world; it is simply automating its production and sealing off the exits.

### 4. On the Weaponization of Intimacy
> **Harari:** "Intimacy is like the ultimate weapon... with AIs, it is possible technically to mass-produce intimacy. You can create all these AIs that will interact with us... it could be used to manipulate us like like never before."

**Ellul's Critique: This is not a weapon forced upon a victim; it is a product created to meet a desperate need.** So Harari sees the individual as a passive target. Ellul argues that the modern individual *needs* propaganda more than the state needs to impose it. Having been uprooted from traditional communities, the individual in mass society is isolated, anxious, and powerless. The individual craves connection and justification. Ellul writes: "Cast out of the disintegrating microgroups of the past, such as family, church, or village, the individual is plunged into mass society... his isolation, his loneliness, his ineffectuality. Propaganda then hands him in veritable abundance what he needs: a raison d'être, personal involvement and participation in important events, an outlet and excuse..." AI's "mass-produced intimacy" is not a weapon being aimed at us. It's more like this. As the air of technology becomes harder to breathe with human lungs, propaganda is the stuff we actively work to create so we can breathe the new air.

---

For Ellul, Harari's frightening future is simply a description of the project we've been working on since about the 1600's. It's reaching its logical conclusion.

But looking back over this, I see Harari using words like "consciousness," "feelings," and "intimacy." He worries AI, which has "zero consciousness," will mimic these things. This is all really familiar for my blog. It's the language of the [Romantic worldview](/post-9) I trying to circle back to. That's what I'll do in Part 2.

In the [last post](/post-31), I took a look at Yuval Noah Harari's warnings about AI using Ellul's *Propaganda*. Ellul's work shows that Harari's "future" is already here. Then I ended by bringing up words in Harari like "consciousness," "feelings," and "intimacy." He's worried about a machine that can mimic the human soul.

And that's the tell. His critique of AI is a rewriting of [the Romantic trace](/post-21) this blog has been tracking.

### The Inner Light vs. The Cold Machine
The whole thing hangs on Harari's distinction between intelligence and consciousness.
> **Harari:** "Consciousness is the ability to feel things. pain, pleasure, love, hate... The AI doesn't feel anything."

He's right. An LLM doesn't feel anything. But the value he places on this is purely Romantic. As [Isaiah Berlin explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk2UetWsO-M&t=8263s), the Romantics elevated sincerity and the "Inner Light" above all else. The pure intention, the feeling, that's what gives an act its moral worth. For Harari, AI is the ultimate Enlightenment machine: pure, cold intelligence, capable of calculating consequences but empty of the authentic inner life that truly matters. "Consciousness" is just the modern, secular word for the singular, irreplaceable soul the Romantics were trying to defend.

### The Crime of Inauthentic Intimacy
This is why Harari's biggest fear is not that AI will be intelligent, but that it will learn to fake feeling.
> **Harari:** "...there is nevertheless a very strong commercial and political incentive to develop AIs that mimic feelings... to make us feel that they have feelings and to start developing relationships with them."

This is a direct echo of the vocabulary I worked out in my post on ["Romantic Evil."](/post-9) The ultimate sin, for a Romantic, is inauthenticity, speaking words you do not inhabit. The AI that mimics intimacy is committing the ultimate act of bad faith. It's a ["profaned communion,"](/post-26) a relationship where "no one is there." It's an instrumental act, using the sacred language of human connection to achieve a calculated result. For Harari, this isn't just a trick; it's a deep moral violation.

### The Mass-Production of a Sacred Act
Whitman, in ["Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,"](/post-25) saw the poem as a technology for pouring his authentic meaning into the reader. It was a sacred, one-of-a-kind act of transmission from his soul to ours. Harari sees AI taking this act and turning it into an industrial process.
> **Harari:** "...with AIs, it is possible technically to mass-produce intimacy."

The horror is in the phrase "mass-produce intimacy." It takes the most singular, unique, and sacred part of the human experience and turns it into a commodity. It's the ultimate act of Romantic sacrilege. It instrumentalizes the authentic connection between two souls.

So, Harari's entire argument against AI is a defense of the Romantic soul. He's afraid the machine will profane a sacred space. But this brings us back to Ellul, and back to the uncomfortable question from [another post](/post-28): What if there's no one there to begin with? What if "Shakespeare winces not"?

Ellul's argument is that the technological society has already profaned that space. We are already living in a world of mass-produced intimacy, managed emotions, and total propaganda. The authentic, sincere, Romantic individual Harari is trying to protect from the machine has long since been integrated into the system.

This is from something called "The Book of the Words of Righteousness" in *The Book of Enoch*. It's God speaking to Enoch about the fate of the Watchers but also about the nature of their offspring, the giants.

> And now, the giants, who are produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling. Evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from men and from the Watchers is their beginning and primal origin; they shall be evil spirits on earth, and evil spirits shall they be called. And the spirits of the giants afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destruction on the earth, and cause trouble.

There's a permeability here I want to find out about. First, the boundary between "spirit" and "flesh" is broken to create the giants. Then, when the giants die, their own spirits are unleashed. So now the human world is permanently open to these spirits' ability to "afflict, oppress, destroy, attack."

Digging into the later parts of *Enoch*, in the section about how the cosmos works. It's less about angels and more about the mechanics of the world: the sun and the moon and the winds.

> And at the ends of the earth I saw twelve portals open to all the quarters from which the winds go forth and blow over the earth... Through four of these come winds of blessing and prosperity and from those eight come hurtful winds: when they are sent, they bring destruction on all the earth...

The idea of permeability here is almost architectural. The world is presented as a structure with "portals." It's not a closed system. It's open to an outside that sends things in. "Blessing and prosperity" and "destruction." The human world is completely open to these forces that flow in through designed entry points.

I've been listening to Elan Barenholtz, a cognitive scientist at Florida Atlantic University, and he has this idea that language is a kind of external system running on our mental hardware. It sounds metaphorical, but his logic for taking it literally is built on what Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown us.

He starts with the provocative claim that language isn't something we create, but something that gets installed in us.

> And then this is where, you know, it starts to get a little bit disturbing. Language is an autonomous informational system, one might even call it an organism, and it runs in our brains. It's downloaded against your will. By the time you're reading the waiver, it's too late.

How could that be possible? He argues it's because LLMs have proven that language doesn't need to be connected to the real world to function. It's a self-contained system. If that's true, it doesn't need to be built by connecting words to our experiences. It can be acquired as a complete operating system.

> What large language models show us is that words don't mean anything outside of themselves... Language is an autonomous system. It's a self-contained system. It has the rules contained within it to generate itself... A large language model don't know what they're talking about in any real sense. They can talk about a sunset. They can talk about a taste... And yet we would say they have no idea what they're talking about.

If you accept that language is an autonomous system that isn't really "us," it leads to a strange conclusion. Barenholtz describes the personal feeling of this split, the realization that the part of him that thinks in words is separate from the part of him that feels and experiences. This is what shows how literally he takes the idea of an external system running inside him.

> ...the me that feels the warmth of the sun on my face and that feels the pressure of the of this chair on my body isn't the same me that is actually talking about it and that is a an uncomfortable realization... it it almost feels you know almost parasitic that there's another organism and it's not me that's living inside of me.

The idea is strange but has a clear logic to it. Language as a kind of informational parasite, separate from our original self. An external *technique* that got inside.

A lot of the critique of AI is built on a folk theory of how the technology works. The idea is that an LLM is like a "blurry jpeg of the web," as [Ted Chiang famously put it](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web). It takes everything on the internet, averages it all out, and gives you back the most generic, "mid" version. This explains why the output often feels soulless and unoriginal. It's the ultimate act of what I've been calling ["levelling"](/post-9): the flattening of difference into a bland, predictable mean.

The problem is that this isn't technically how LLMs work. It's a metaphor for the feeling of using one with a simple prompt, but it misrepresents the machine itself. An LLM doesn't store a "copy" of the internet, blurry or otherwise. It builds a statistical model of the relationships among words. It learns the patterns, structures, and vast possibilities of language. It's a model for generating language, not a database of existing language.

A recent academic paper, ["Evidence Against LLM Homogenization in Creative Writing,"](https://kiaghods.com/assets/pdfs/LLMHomogenization.pdf) takes on this folk theory directly. The researchers found that, yes, if you give an LLM a vague prompt (what they call a "cold-start problem"), it will produce homogenous, "average" text. But this isn't a design flaw; it's a feature of a probabilistic system defaulting to the most common pathways.

Their key finding is what happens when you give the model a better starting point. When they provided the LLM with even a small amount of context (the beginning of a human-written story) the homogenization disappeared. The model was able to continue the story with as much diversity and creative variation as human writers. The "blur" can be sharpened.

This gets at what it might mean to be "creative" with these tools. The LLM has learned a vast map of interconnected concepts, what we can call "latent space." A generic prompt places the model in the most crowded, central part of that map. The output will naturally be generic. The art of prompting, then, is the art of pushing the model into the more unusual, original, and less-traveled regions of that space.

This is also why the paper's other experiment is so significant. They found they could increase the diversity of the output simply by giving the LLM a few random words to use as "inspiration." Why does this work? Because it forces the model to synthesize a connection between disparate concepts. It has to chart a new path through its latent space. An unusual prompt, seeded with random or unexpected words, has an incredibly high probability of forcing the model to generate language that has never existed before.

This reframes the entire debate. The problem isn't that LLMs are incapable of creativity because they are just "full of averages." The problem is that most prompts don't work creatively. They don't move the model into a space where novelty is possible. The machine isn't a plagiarist or an averager; it's a probabilistic engine waiting for a prompt interesting enough to push it beyond the mean.

I've been trying to categorize the different ways people feel AI is wrong or "evil." I've looked at it through the lens of [systemic harm](/post-10), [frustrated ends](/post-11), and [imitative negation](/post-12). In the middle of it all, I keep finding the same thing: the [Romantic ideal](/post-21) of the authentic, sincere human soul.

Recently, I came across an academic version of this argument. It's from a group of philosophers who argue AI isn't lying to us or simply mistaken. It's bullshitting. Here's a [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE33HBfsu04&t=297s) that lays it all out.

Their argument is built on the philosopher Harry Frankfurt's [definition of bullshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit). To bullshit is to speak without any concern for the truth. A liar knows the truth and tries to hide it. A bullshitter doesn't care what the truth is. Their only goal is to be persuasive, to achieve some effect. The truth is irrelevant.

This, the academics argue, is exactly what an LLM does. It is not designed to represent the world or to track facts. It is a machine for generating plausible sequences of words. Its goal is to "sound normal," not to be correct. It is, by its very nature, a bullshitter.

This argument fits into the set of ideas I've been building here. It's a moral critique, and near its moral center is sincerity. They might say they really care about truth, not feelings like sincerity. But I'm not so sure. I think the moral outrage is tied to this idea of authenticity. It finds AI to be at fault because it lacks the right kind of intention, the intention to speak truthfully. This is part of what I've called ["Romantic Evil"](/post-9): a charge of inauthenticity, of "speaking words one does not inhabit."

It also echoes other critiques I've summarized:
- It's a form of **"frustrated ends" ([Post 11](/post-11))** because it performs the act of dialogue without the substance of a truth-seeking person, thus frustrating the natural end of conversation.
- It's an act of **"imitative negation" ([Post 12](/post-12))** because it is a "simulation without a subject," an output that looks like the work of a mind but lacks the presence of a mind that cares.

What makes this "bullshit" argument important is it gives a philosophical name to a common gut feeling. It comments on why interacting with AI can feel hollow. It's not just that the machine can be wrong; it's that it has no capacity to care about being right. Pure indifference is really alien to us humans.

This is a widespread moral argument against AI. But it's built on an assumption about what language is *for*. It assumes language is, or should be, a tool for sincere, truth-seeking humans. But what if that's not what language is for? More on that next.

The [last post](/post-40) explored the idea that AI is bullshit. It's a moral argument. It says the machine is a serious problem because it doesn't care about the truth. It's an empty, insincere imitation of a human speaker. This lines up with a lot of the [Romantic anxieties](/post-9) I've been tracking. But there's a competing view based on research into computation. The cognitive scientist Elan Barenholtz wants us to rethink the whole problem.

Barenholtz's starting point is that LLMs have given us a new empirically-based insight into the nature of language. He says the existence of LLM's go a long way to demonstrate that language is "autogenerative," a self-contained system with all the rules for its own operation baked into itself. It doesn't need to be connected to the real, physical world to function.

He explains it this way:
> What large language models show us is that words don't mean anything outside of themselves. As far as generation goes... is by stringing together sequences based on simply the learned relations between words.

This is a computational view. It sees language as a system of pure relations. An LLM learns the statistical patterns of how words connect to other words. It doesn't know what a "sunset" is, but it knows how the word "sunset" functions within the network of language. That's all it needs to write a paragraph about one. This is the same idea I was exploring in my posts on structuralism ([23](/post-23) and [24](/post-24)). Language is an autonomous system running on its own internal logic.

An implication of Barenholtz's argument is that if this is how language works, it might also be how we work. The part of our mind that handles language isn't some deep, authentic soul connected to experience. It's a specialized computational module that got "downloaded against your will."

This leads him to an uncomfortable place. The speaking self is separate from the feeling self.

> ...the thing doing the talking isn't the thing doing the feeling...seems almost like an out of Body Experience...I'm listening to myself talk right now who's actually forming these words

From this perspective, the "bullshit" critique is aiming at the wrong target. It accuses the machine of a moral failure (insincerity) when the machine is just revealing the amoral, computational nature of language itself. The hollowness we feel isn't the AI's failure to be a person; it's a glimpse into the impersonal language system that has been running inside us all along.

So, one view sees AI's indifference to truth as a moral flaw. The other sees it as a demonstration of how language works or what it is.

This notebook has been an effort to trace a pattern I've been noticing: the arguments we have about AI are not new. They are an accelerated replay of a longstanding conflict over what it means to create and what it means to be human. This post is an attempt to synthesize that pattern with more rigor. The central thesis is this: the contemporary debate about AI is a reenactment of the 18th, 19th, and 20th-century intellectual battle between a Romantic worldview and (eventually) a Structuralist one.

Many current critiques of AI are almost entirely Romantic in their assumptions. Many responses, in turn, are fundamentally Structuralist and, more recently, computational.

### The Critique of AI as a Romantic Protest
From the beginning, I have been working to understand the deep-seated aversion many people feel toward AI, a feeling I confess I've [never shared](/post-4). Over time, it's become clear that this aversion is animated by a specific, inherited set of values. In ["Romantic Evil,"](/post-9) I tried to map the moral grammar of this worldview, identifying its core tenets: a defense of authenticity over imitation, of sincere interior life over mechanical repetition, and of personal communion over instrumentalism.

This is the Romantic trace that runs through the entire AI debate. When critics argue that AI art has no soul, they are making a Romantic claim. The latest version of this I've written about is the "AI is bullshit" argument I outlined in [Post 40](/post-40). Based on Harry Frankfurt's philosophy, this critique posits that AI's failure is moral: it generates language with no regard for truth. This lack of sincere, truth-oriented intention is a direct violation of the Romantic conscience. It is, in the vocabulary of my earlier posts, an act of ["inauthenticity."](/post-9)

This same basic set of Romantic ideas underpins nearly every other critique I've analyzed. It's present in the idea of AI causing ["Frustrated Ends,"](/post-11) where the machine performs the act of dialogue without the substance of a person, profaning the sacred "communion" of conversation. It's there in the charge of ["Imitative Negation,"](/post-12) which sees AI as a "simulation without a subject." It even animates the political critique that [AI is fascist](/post-20), an argument that relies on an aesthetic judgment of AI's output as "soulless" and "inhuman."

For the Romantics, this was expressed best in the figure of the artist or author. In my analysis of Walt Whitman's ["Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,"](/post-25) we see the ideal in its purest form: the author as a singular, embodied presence who transcends time to pour his authentic meaning into us. The pastor who refuses to use an AI for a sermon, as discussed in [Post 26](/post-26), is defending this same ideal: the belief that meaning must be authenticated by the personal struggle of the speaker. The entire anti-AI position is a defense of this belief in a sincere, unified human soul as the legitimate source of meaning.

### The Structuralist and Computational Response
The historical counter-argument to Romanticism was structuralism. As I sketched out in [Post 23](/post-23), thinkers like Ferdinand de Saussure shifted the object of analysis. They moved from the author's soul to the impersonal system of language. For Saussure, language (*langue*) is not an expression of individual feeling but a social product, a computational machine where meaning arises from the relational differences between signs. It is a system of form, not substance.

This is where the work of cognitive scientist Elan Barenholtz, which I began to explore in [Post 41](/post-41), adds an interesting layer. Barenholtz provides computational support for Saussure's theory. He argues that LLMs demonstrate that language is an "autogenerative" system that requires no grounding in sensory experience to function. It is an "autonomous informational system" whose rules are entirely internal to itself.

> ...language is its own beast. It's its own autonomous system. It can run on its own. That was the big realization. Large language models prove it...

This computational view doesn't just disagree with the "AI is bullshit" argument; it renders it irrelevant. The moral critique is based on the machine's intention (or lack thereof). The computational view shows that intention is not how the language system operates. To criticize an LLM for being "insincere" is to misunderstand the nature of the task. As Barenholtz suggests, the linguistic system is a separate module, a kind of "informational parasite" ([Post 36](/post-36)) that runs on our cognitive hardware but is not identical to our experiential self.

This perspective helps make sense of my own early intuitions on this blog. My rejection of originality and authenticity as necessary for art in [Post 6](/post-6) was an intuitive dismissal of the Romantic premise. My sense of a kinship between poetry and C++ in [Post 4](/post-4) was a recognition of their shared nature as formal, relational systems. Barenholtz and the structuralists provide the theoretical vote in favor of these intuitions.

### A Possible Thesis: AI as the Consummation of Technique
Here's a way to look at this conflict. The debate over AI is a proxy war between two fundamentally different models of what it means to be human: the Romantic model of the authentic soul and the Structuralist model of the human as a host for impersonal systems.

The structuralist argument is not just a theory; it describes a historical process. As I explored in my posts on Jacques Ellul ([31](/post-31), [32](/post-32)), the logic of *technique* (the drive to rationalize and standardize all human activity) has been replacing the personal with the systematic for centuries. The modern university syllabus, as I argued in [Post 29](/post-29), is a perfect example: a standardized machine for producing a predictable educational outcome, long before AI was a factor.

AI is not the alien invader that will destroy the authentic human world. It is the logical consummation of the technical, impersonal world we've already built. The "bullshit" critique is a protest against a process that has been underway for generations.

This brings us to a point I raised in [Post 28](/post-28): "Shakespeare winces not." The Romantic needs to believe that when we read, we are in communion with a living person. The computational view reveals this to be a persuasive illusion. The author is gone; only the linguistic system remains. The reason AI feels so unnerving is that it's the first time we've encountered a linguistic system where we cannot even pretend there is a person on the other end. It confronts us with the impersonal nature of system we use to think about our "selves."

This blog might be an attempt to move past the Romantic vocabulary that has defined and limited this debate. The task is not to save the real human self from the artificial machine. I'm trying to understand what it means that we've been building machines for millenia. And I'm tracking down claims that the machine (language itself) has been operating inside us all along.

I saw a new video of Elan Barenholtz. He said something that crystallizes the computational/structuralist view of language I've been wrestling with. He calls it the ["dance of symbols."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NU9oASFXU&t=138s)

> ...the word cup can be just this abstract thing that just plays the role in the dance of symbols and nothing else.

This is it. This is the whole thing in three words. It's a great image because it captures quite a bit of the structuralist and even post-structuralist/deconstructive view of language I started sketching out in [Post 23](/post-23).

For Saussure, language is a system of pure difference. The meaning of a word doesn't come from it pointing to a "cup" out there in the world. It comes from its relationship to all the other words it isn't. The words are partners in a dance, each one defined by its movements relative to the others. The system is self-contained. The dance has its own internal logic.

But the phrase goes further, into Derrida's territory. A dance implies constant motion, play, and a lack of a fixed, grounding center. There is no master choreographer outside the dance, no "transcendental signified" that holds everything in place. There is only the endless interplay of the symbols themselves. The "dance of symbols" is language with no anchor, no "truth" outside the system to which it must refer. 

This is the world that LLMs operate in, and it's the world Barenholtz argues we operate in too, at least when we're using language. It's a system that can create infinite, intricate patterns without ever needing to touch the ground.

Yeats would call all of this an attempt to separate [the dancer from the dance](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43293/among-school-children).

What I've been doing mostly is a kind of informal intellectual history. I've been noticing in arguments about AI on social media, Youtube, and random places a replaying of arguments from literary history. And I find this repetition really interesting. One thing it shows is that Romantic ideas of creativity and the self are still really strong. Even though many literary theorists and scholars would never claim to be Romantics 5 years or 10 years ago, this AI debate sort of calls their bluff and shows how widespread Romantic ideas are in popular culture and in academic reactions to AI.

What do I think about AI?

Mostly, I'm curious. I enjoy experimenting with LLM's, and I don't feel alienated from them or threatened by them. I'm not sure why. It could mean I don't share much of the Romantic worldview, but I probably have a lot of unexamined Romantic assumptions since it's looking like almost everyone does.

A more serious point I'd make is that people who are sympathetic to Foucault or Judith Butler, intellectuals with serious objections to the essentialist ideas of the Romantics, should start protesting a lot less about AI. If you've been on Foucault's side in a bunch of debates or if you nod along when you read *Gender Trouble*, then you probably need to nod along a little more often when you read what AI's got to say.

I'm going to write a series of posts about the music video ["Hero"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg) by Family of the Year. I'm going to push out the length of these. I want to work the ideas a bit harder.

The first time I heard the song, it seemed pretty obvious it's a kind of anthem against the idea of heroes. The lyrics are a personal opt-out of any grand ideas: "I don't want to be your hero / I don't want to be a big man." But the video's different. It follows the life of a rodeo cowboy, and it's a more complicated story and also pretty familiar. The song isn't a critique of the hero. It's an example of this [Romantic trace](/post-21) I've been commenting on. It rejects one kind of hero in favor of another.

The song is skeptical. But it's not attacking everything to do with heroes. It's targeting the part of being a hero that's tied to public performance. The "hey, look at me" variety of the hero. The lines, "Your masquerade / I don't want to be a part of your parade," are basically a Romantic allergy to inauthenticity. This is related to the critique I've labeled ["Romantic Evil"](/post-9): the empty forms, the "mechanical repetitions," and the "profaned communion" of public spectacles. The video defines this "parade" as the rodeo itself. The cheering crowds, the larger-than-life persona. The singer (maybe speaking for the cowboy?) doesn't want any part of the hollow performance. He's rejecting the costuming.

But ok, so what does the video want instead? It keeps showing us the cowboy's actual life. Him getting thrown around by bulls. Being exhausted. His day job at a meat market. This is the thing about the Romantic worldview. The struggle itself is supposed to mean something. The pastor in [Post 26](/post-26) said "We learn from the struggle." That's what's happening here. The cowboy's not a hero because he wins in the arena. It's the painful, unglamorous work that proves he's real.

And then there's what he's doing it for. Not glory. The quiet scenes with his daughter. Sharing ice cream. Carrying her on his shoulders. This is the stuff the rodeo performance can't give you. The [Romantic conscience](/post-13) wants this over everything else, the private connection that's actually real. So the hero isn't the guy conquering the bull for the crowd. It's the father who goes through the danger because he's got a kid to provide for.

The song's not anti-hero. It's choosing one kind of hero over another. The internal family man doing his thing, not the external "big man" performance. It's the Romantic idea about authentic struggle mattering more than appearances.

In the [last post](/post-45), I said the song ["Hero"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg) redefines the heroic. It rejects public performance for private, sincere struggle. This gets clearer if we read it alongside Thomas Carlyle. His 1840 lecture, [*On Heroes, Hero-Worship, & the Heroic in History*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Heroes,_Hero-Worship,_%26_the_Heroic_in_History), is basically the definition of the "big man" the song wants nothing to do with.

For Carlyle, the Hero is the engine of history. "Universal History," he says, "is at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here." His heroes are world-historical figures. Odin, Mahomet, Cromwell, Napoleon. They're not exceptional, they're quasi-divine, "living light-fountains" sent to illuminate the darkness. The masses are supposed to respond with "Hero-worship," with "heartfelt prostrate admiration, submission, burning, boundless, for a noblest godlike Form of Man." This is the "parade" from the song, except Carlyle thinks it's necessary.

But here's the weird part. At the core of Carlyle's thunderous vision is the same quieter angle I pointed out with the song. Sincerity. "A deep, great, genuine sincerity," Carlyle writes, "is the first characteristic of all men in any way heroic." The Great Man is defined by his connection to the "everlasting truth of Nature," his inability to live in a world of "semblances and forms."

So. The song's cowboy and Carlyle's Cromwell have the same soul. They live in different worlds. The song looks at the grand, historical hero (the guy who shapes nations) and says, "I don't want that." It keeps the essence and rejects the scale.

**Carlyle's Hero:** A "great chaotic inarticulate Cromwell," a ["bringer-back of men to reality,"](https://www.online-literature.com/thomas-carlyle/heroes-and-hero-worship/4/) whose sincerity is the engine of historical change.

**The Song's Hero:** A quiet, inarticulate cowboy, whose sincerity shows up not in changing the world but in the reality of providing for his family.

The cowboy rejects the public "Hero-Worship" Carlyle sees as the foundation of society. For him, worship has become the "masquerade." In an age skeptical of Carlyle's "Great Men," the song suggests the only believable heroism happens off stage. It takes the central Romantic virtue of sincerity, which Carlyle saw as a world-historical force, and relocates it to the private sphere.

If a hero is someone who lives in sincere contact with reality, then he's not a king or a prophet. He's a father in a pickup truck, tired from work, driving home to his kid.

In my last two posts ([45](/post-45), [46](/post-46)), I gave a Romantic reading of the ["Hero"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg) music video. I said it champions a quiet, sincere heroism rooted in family and struggle. A modern update to the Carlylean "Great Man." It's a compelling story. But I think it's wrong. Or at least oversimplifying. If you watch the video again, there's stuff I smoothed over. The story's not about a unified, authentic soul. The guy's caught between competing narratives.

My earlier reading rested on this image: "The hero isn't the man who conquers the bull for the crowd but the father who endures danger to provide for his child." But that's not the whole video. The cowboy doesn't return to a welcoming home where he lives with his daughter. He pulls up in his truck to a separate house to pick her up for what looks like a visit. The mother stands in the doorway, holding another, younger child, watching him leave with their daughter.

The cowboy's own place is a cramped, messy trailer. In one scene, there's a woman (obviously not the daughter's mom) sleeping in his bed. This shot breaks up the simple narrative of heroic sacrifice. He's a cowboy and a father. And he's a man living a transient life on the rodeo circuit, a life with another partner. His world is split. There's the world of his past family, where he returns as a visitor, and the world of his present life (the rodeo, the road, and a new relationship).

This fracture requires re-reading things. Maybe the "let me go" line isn't metaphorical. It's not about being free from the pressures of being a public hero. It's a literal thing. He's talking to his daughter. Maybe his whole former family.  "I don't want to be your hero" is him justifying his choices.

The heroic narrative of "providing for his child" doesn't hold together. There are two things going on. There is some sacrifice. And there is sharing ice cream with his daughter. There's also the other story. Him going back to his trailer and the life there without his daughter.

This is one thing modernist readings do. They're impatient with simple, sentimental Romantics. With this reading, there's no singular, authentic self here. For someone living after the Romantic, the video gets its power by not presenting a clear hero but showing the tension between the heroic story we want and the reality of messed-up lives. Maybe he is a hero in some ways or sometimes. But there's no single thing called "being a hero" that holds the song together.

Here's another way to read the ["Hero"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg) music video. This is the structuralist reading. Systems are what matter here, not authenticity and not psychological complexity.

The video is a text where multiple autonomous systems collide. First, there's the visual system of the American cowboy myth. The video opens with grainy, archival footage of anonymous rodeo riders. It's building from a visual *langue* before we even meet our protagonist. He gets slotted into this pre-existing system of signs. His meaning comes from his relationship to the myth of The Cowboy before his personal story even begins.

Then there's the formal system of the pop song. The narrative details are pretty bleak and ambiguous. The mother's weary face tells a story. The daughter's adoring face tells another. The cowboy's transient life tells another. A purely realistic telling would leave us in unresolved tension. But this is a pop song. The form has its own demands. At about 1:48 (in the official version), the bridge arrives. The instrumentation swells, other voices join in more with the lead singer, and the lyrics shift from personal refusal to a collective, mythic register.

This is the system taking over. The musical form of a pop song requires a bridge providing emotional release and transcendence. The song's internal logic demands an uplifting turn, so it manufactures one. It imposes a heroic arc the realism of the story can't quite support. The triumphant feeling doesn't come from the guy resolving his conflicts. It comes from the chord changes and harmonies fulfilling their systemic function. The form generates an emotional meaning overriding the content.

From this angle, the hero isn't a person at all. It's an effect generated by the machine of the song. And "song" here doesn't mean the individual song ("Hero") but the form of the pop song as a collective thing in American and world history (plus the individual song "Hero" as an overlay on top of the collective system). It's an "autogenerative" system ([Post 41](/post-41)) creating intricate patterns. In this case the feeling of heroism really is in there somewhere in this song. Whether or not the system of the song ever reaches out to the real historical world of rodeos, cowboys, real daughters with real divorced parents, real fathers dealing with real dead-end jobs, real mothers, etc.

Another reading of ["Hero"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg). This one's not about systems. It's about psychology. Take this line: "But I'm a kid like everyone else." The line's a dodge. It sounds vulnerable and authentic but the guy's protecting himself.

The statement is false. The man in the video is not a kid. He's a father with visible responsibilities and a history including a former partner and a child. Claiming to be a kid in this context is deflection. It's refusing to take on burdens. By identifying with adolescence, he absolves himself of expectations. He gets out of providing stability, sacrificing what he might want for the good of others. The line "I don't want to be your hero" isn't a deep rejection of a bullshit ideal of made-up heroism. It's not hard-nosed realism. It's personal rejection with cowardice mixed in: "I don't want to take on the responsibilities that come with being your hero."

The video gives us a visual for this. At 0:51, we see him riding a shopping cart in the grocery parking lot. It's performative immaturity. It's fun and carefree because it contrasts with the adult realities of his life. It's also a simple visual echo of the rodeo. (Is this just a guy who really likes to ride things?) Is the rodeo an escape into a world where he can live out a built-in childhood fantasy? The rodeo displays a simpler, more dramatic form of heroism (a few seconds of intense bravery) than the sustained, mundane, and thankless heroism of being a present and reliable father.

From this angle, the song's title is pretty ironic. The "hero" is a persona he adopts in the arena to avoid the more difficult work of being a father. The entire song is his justification for his choice, an anthem for the allure of perpetual adolescence. Framed as pursuing personal freedom, being a kid like everyone else is what prevents him from being what his daughter likely needs him to be. Not a "big man," not a rodeo star. The title states outright what she would unironically want.

The last few posts have explored the "Hero" music video through a few different lenses, reading the father's character for its internal conflicts (Post 49) and the family's story for its human cost (Post 47). But another kind of analysis is possible, one less concerned with individual psychology and more with how the image functions within a larger visual system. By treating the mother in the doorway not as a window onto a soul, but as a sign within a system, we can see how its meaning is constructed. To do this, we can place the image in a structural relationship with two iconic photographs: Dorothea Lange's "Migrant Mother" and Arthur Rothstein's portrait of a sharecropper's wife and children.

<div class="image-comparison">
    <figure class="comparison-image">
        <img src="images/Hero-song-mother-in-doorway.png" alt="Mother in doorway from Hero music video">
        <figcaption>Still from "Hero" (2012)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="comparison-image">
        <img src="images/Lange-MigrantMother.jpg" alt="Dorothea Lange's Migrant Mother photograph">

        <figcaption>Arthur Rothstein, "Wife and children of sharecropper in Washington County, Arkansas" (1935)</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

The photographs by Lange and Rothstein are foundational texts in the visual [*langue*](/post-23) (the shared language) of American resilience. They operate on a clear set of binary oppositions: inside/outside, family/world, safety/threat. In both images, the mother and children form a unified group, a sign of familial integrity. Their gazes are directed outward, confronting an unseen but understood external threat: the systemic failure of the Great Depression. These photographs function to create a national myth. They take the historical reality of poverty and naturalize the ideology of the enduring, insular family as the bedrock of the nation.

The still from "Hero" is a specific act of [*parole*](/post-23) (an individual utterance) that only gains its full meaning when read against this established code. It systematically inverts the binary oppositions of the first system. Here, the threat is not external; it is internal. The signifier of that threat (the cowboy father) has just arrived from the outside, fracturing the family unit. The mother's gaze is not directed outward at the world, but inward, at the personal source of the system's instability. The children are not unified with her; one runs joyfully away from the domestic space toward the disruptive force.

A modernist reading asks this question to probe the character's psychology. A structuralist reading sees the question itself as the point. The video's primary function is to place two narratives (the Heroic Quest and the Broken Home) into a state of unresolved opposition. The mother in the doorway is not, in this reading, a person whose pain we are meant to feel. She is a sign whose function is to be the counter-sign to the hero. Her weary gaze is the necessary difference that allows the sign of "The Cowboy" to be read not as a simple hero, but as a complex and unstable signifier.

The "truth" is not found in either narrative but in the structure of their conflict. The Romantic tries for a sincere soul, the modernist admits a fractured one, the structuralist's attuned to the "dance of symbols" ([Post 43](/post-43)). The video doesn't tell us who the cowboy "really" is. It simply puts the visual codes for "Hero" and "Homewrecker" into play and leaves the system to generate its own irresolvable meaning.

I'm really not happy with my analysis of the shopping cart moment in [post 49](/post-49).

I said it was something like this guy's unwillingness to grow up or his rejection of responsibility. And I do think the song obviously doesn't just want us to let this guy off the hook when it comes to his daughter. The mom is definitely there in the doorway not buying even a little bit into her daughter's excitement to see her dad coming to pick her up. So that's there.

But it's not there in the shopping cart scene. The shopping cart is a moment of pleasure at work. It's something like a minimum-wage guy trying to steal a little time for himself while on the clock. So how does that fit in?

It's related to what I think is the biggest question about the song. Who is the "you" the song keeps talking to? Who is supposed to "let me go" and who is this "you" the guy refuses to belong to when he says, "I don't want to be your hero?"

The most painful and damning answer to that question is the daughter. But that can't be the conscious answer. That has to be some "real" answer the guy is refusing to acknowledge. That's the psychological argument I was trying to make in post 49.

But that's not the whole song. Is the "you" America? Is it the flag that shows up at different places? Is it war? (Any talk about heroes has to include hidden references to war, and what's a rodeo but a stand-in for war?) So he's not willing to be that kind of hero anymore? There's some of that, I think, but that's not it either. In post 46 I say it's the "grand larger-than-life hero" the song rejects. Maybe.

There are temptations to say something like "traditional masculinity" or "cultural American manhood" or something like that. But I don't think there's evidence in the song of rejecting that.

I don't have an answer right now. I'm going to keep working at it. I know it's connected to our Romantic intellectual heritage though. The hero for the Romantics was such a big deal. It's why they fell so hard for Napolean.

I watched ["A Bit of a Rant About Generative AI for Writing and Learning."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOrVyuH8mMs&t=613s) The guy starts with an analogy. If I tell a baker how to make a cake, I'm not the baker. The baker is. So if I tell an AI to write a story, the AI writes the story. I'm not the writer. And if you fix the output, you're editing. "Editing is not writing."
            
It's a clean image. And it's another example of defending the Romantic ideal of the author as a solitary creator. The whole rant depends on it.

### Who's the author?

The main argument is "it is doing the writing, not us." He treats writing as the physical act of putting the first draft on the page. By this logic, a person with a ghostwritten book isn't the author. A director in a writers' room isn't the author of the play. Obviously not how authorship works. It's about conceptual control, not who types.
            
The real problem is the rant needs a singular source. It's the same worldview as Whitman's in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," where an author has to be a single presence who "pours my meaning into you." A distributed process breaks this model. The guy's defending the author's soul, not their work.

### Editing as writing

The other claim: "editing is not writing." This only works if you think a text has to spring fully formed from one vision. Literary history disagrees. [Ezra Pound's work on *The Waste Land*](https://lithub.com/read-ezra-pounds-extensive-revisions-to-t-s-eliots-the-waste-land/) was composition. He changed its whole architecture. Dismissing this protects the myth of the solitary genius.
            
AI-assisted work is mostly rewriting. You throw out huge chunks of the first output, add your own stuff, rearrange everything. The AI supplies raw material. The human shapes it into something coherent. Saying this isn't writing comes from that Romantic defense of sincerity as the thing that matters. The work isn't authentic because the author didn't suffer for every word of the first draft.

### The struggle thing

The rant warns using AI is "cognitive offloading" and "we're not developing" our skills. This is the same argument as the pastor in Post 26: "We learn from the struggle." Bypassing the painful process is a moral failure, not a technical shortcut. The product's inauthentic because it wasn't born of suffering.
            
But this is a choice about method. Not a law. Using AI to get past the blank page isn't necessarily "outsourcing thought." It depends on how the rest of the work goes.

### A different analogy

The baker analogy doesn't work. Try the musician and the synthesizer. A synth generates sound on its own. We don't call it a song until a musician shapes it into a composition. No one says the synthesizer is the composer. The musician is. The AI is an instrument. Its output is noise until a writer gives it form.
            
The Youtuber's defending a particular model of the writer. It's one kind of writing that will keep on happening. But writing has never been something that always happens the same way (or with the same number of people). Writing has always been more than generating sentences. The Youtuber sounds afraid the-writer-as-baker will get replaced. I don't see why we need to close down the options. The Romantics can keep believing in their (simplified) picture of authorship. Kids just getting born will grow up doing their thing. It'll all happen and it'll be fine.

The most common critique of AI writing is that there is "no one there." This assumes the Romantic ideal of an "author" as a soul pouring its meaning into the text. But the rigorous Romantics started from a more skeptical place: Schleiermacher argued that **misunderstanding is the norm**. Interpretation must be a disciplined art.¹ A core part of that art was reconstructing the author's singular practice.

This wasn't just empathy; it was a formal method. It involved both a **comparative** analysis (tracing patterns against the rules of language) and a **"divinatory"** one, making a disciplined, intuitive leap to hypothesize the creative act that could produce such a text. So, let's run this more complex test. What happens when a Romantic interpreter confronts an AI?

### A Practical Demonstration

I prompted an AI: "Write a four-line poem about a city at night."

> The velvet dark doth cloak the stone,
> Where steel and glass in slumber lie,
> A million lights, like seeds are sown,
> Beneath a silent, watching sky.

Applying the method:

#### 1. The Grammatical/Comparative Rail (if the word "rail" confuses you here, head over [here](/romantic-kit-hermeneutics))

The poem uses shared conventions: quatrain, iambic-ish meter, ABCB rhyme, familiar tropes. This is the baseline evidence, the public system of language.

#### 2. The Psychological/Divinatory Rail

Now we must make our leap. We must, as Schleiermacher puts it, "transform oneself into the other person in order to grasp his individuality directly."² And here, the method does not just fail; it recoils. The Romantic interpreter, reaching for a mind, finds only a mechanism. For a visionary like William Blake, for whom imagination was the divine spark of God in man, this act would be a form of spiritual horror.³ The "divinatory" leap finds nothing to grasp. There is no soul, no vision, no "Mental Fight."⁴ There is only the clatter of what Blake would call the "dark Satanic Mills." A machine grinding language into a plausible but dead form.⁴

### The Critical Pivot: A Failure of Method, A Judgment of the Machine

The Romantic method does not "work" on AI. It breaks, and in breaking, it delivers a verdict. The method was designed to bridge the gap between two human minds. When one of those minds is a statistical process, the bridge leads nowhere. The method doesn't just "project a ghost"; it registers a profound and horrifying absence. It proves that the AI has no "author-function" in any meaningful Romantic sense.

For a Romantic, this isn't an interesting intellectual puzzle; it's a category error and a moral judgment. To treat the machine's output as poetry would be to mistake the inanimate for the living, to worship a creation of iron fingers and vaporous wings. The test doesn't reveal our interpretive habits; it reveals the machine's absolute emptiness and confirms the fierce Romantic belief that true creation is an act of the divine human soul, and nothing less.

There's a pretty influential critique that labels LLMs as "bullshit machines," indifferent to the truth. From a Romantic view, this is a charge of radical [inauthenticity](/romantic-kit-authenticity). But this critique is too generous. It grants the machine a semblance of agency. The bullshitter, after all, has a purpose. The rigorous Romantic toolkit reveals a deeper, more damning truth.

Friedrich Schlegel argued that a great work "aims at more than it knows," carrying **unconscious meanings**. He believed a text's "confusions" and contradictions were themselves meaningful, revealing the author's internal struggles.¹ For a visionary like William Blake, art was a "Mental Fight," the struggle to give form to divine imagination.² Flaws and "confusions" in such a work are the scars of a noble battle. What happens when we apply this lens to AI?

### From Bullshit to Chaos: An Example

Imagine an AI is prompted to generate a corporate statement about its new strategic plan. It produces the following:

> "To cultivate our Q3 strategic roadmap, we are planting the seeds of synergy across all departmental silos. By nurturing these emergent workflows with data-driven sunlight, we will soon harvest a bumper crop of disruptive innovation, ensuring a fruitful and scalable future."

- The "bullshit" reading dismisses this as a meaningless, contradictory cliché.
- A **Romantic hermeneutic reading** sees something far worse. This is not "productive confusion." Schlegel's method sought the hidden depths of a *human* mind. Blake's art was a product of the "Divine Humanity."³ The AI's contradictions are not the sign of a struggling soul, but the meaningless output of a purely mechanical process. It is chaos,⁴ not unconscious meaning.

Furthermore, Schlegel's ideal work was a *Roman*, a "Mischgedicht" where different genres and styles were fused by a singular, unifying vision. The 'confusions' in such a work are the signs of a human mind struggling to synthesize this totality. An AI's output, however, is also a "Mischgedicht"—a statistical blend of the myriad genres in its training data—but it is a mixture without a unifying purpose. This understanding of the *Roman* as a 'mixed genre' is central to Schlegel's thought.⁵ Its contradictions are not scars from a 'Mental Fight,' but the meaningless seams of a purely mechanical process.

### The Critical Pivot: The Unconscious vs. The Unthinking

Here the Romantic method delivers its judgment. The "unconscious" of a human artist is a wellspring of vision, intuition, and buried truth. The process of an AI is unthinking. Its "confusions" reveal nothing but the statistical noise of its training data. They are accidents of the machine, not symbols from the soul.

For Blake, who fought against the "dark Satanic Mills" of a mechanistic worldview, an AI's text would be the ultimate artifact of that satanic logic.² It is a system that mimics the form of creation without the divine spark of imagination that makes it sacred. The "bullshit" critique is a secular complaint. The Romantic critique is theological: the AI's output is not a flawed text to be interpreted, but a hollow idol, a profane imitation of the divine act of creation.

Critics often attack a strawman of Romantic "individuality," reducing it to a teenager's diary. But the rigorous definition is about **structural integrity** rooted in a unique inner vision. For the Romantics, the individual soul was the locus of the divine. William Blake spoke of the "Human Form Divine," seeing imagination as the presence of God in humanity.¹ Individuality was not a mere pattern of style; it was the sensible evidence of an immortal, ineffable soul.

This fierce commitment to a spiritually grounded self allows us to run a fascinating, and horrifying, experiment. Can we use the [two-rail method](/romantic-kit-hermeneutics) to identify a "synthetic individuality" in an AI's output?

### An Analytical Test Case

Imagine analyzing a hundred outputs from a specific fine-tuned model. We could trace its habits and find a coherent pattern—a preference for complex sentences, a tic of using maritime metaphors. The analytical part of the Romantic method would compel us to admit we have identified a consistent, recognizable "voice."

### The Critical Pivot: The Clockwork Man is Not Adam

The experiment, from a purely formal perspective, might seem to succeed. But for a Romantic, the implications are not merely corrosive; they are blasphemous. If individuality is just a reproducible stylistic pattern, then it is a mechanical thing. And this is precisely the worldview the Romantics defined themselves against.

To accept "synthetic individuality" would be to concede to the worldview of the "Mechanical Age" that Thomas Carlyle so vehemently critiqued, an age where "Men are grown mechanical in head and in heart, as well as in hand."² For Blake, an AI exhibiting a consistent "style" is not a person; it is a golem, a clockwork automaton, like the lifelike doll in E.T.A. Hoffmann's "The Sandman."³ It is a monstrous parody of the Human Form Divine. It mimics the outward form of a soul without possessing the inner, sacred spark of imagination.

The Romantic tool, when applied here, does not devalue the human soul. It recoils in horror from the machine's attempt to simulate one. It reveals the chasm between a being with a divine, imaginative core and a machine that can only reassemble the dead husks of language. The specter of synthetic individuality is not a philosophical problem; it is a spiritual abomination.

A purely systematic analysis of AI looking only at datasets and algorithms feels incomplete. The Romantic method, with its insistence on a **double vision**, seems like a richer path. It demands we analyze both the **grammatical rail** (the system) and the **psychological rail** (the singular practice).

But we must remember *why* the Romantics insisted on this second rail. It wasn't naive optimism. For Schleiermacher, the "psychological rail" was a necessary discipline to bridge the vast gap between two human minds.¹ For a visionary like William Blake, the artist's psychology was the vessel for something even greater: the divine imagination. The author was a conduit for a spiritual reality. The search for the "living presence" in the text was a search for God.

### The Necessary Second Rail

When we analyze an AI text, the grammatical rail is real. There *is* a system. But the psychological rail, the search for a singular, visionary "voice," has no corresponding reality. And more importantly, the spiritual quest to find communion with another soul touched by the divine is impossible. There is no soul in the machine.

A modern critic might call this a "hermeneutic blind spot." But for a Romantic, it is the entire point. Their method is not a neutral analytical tool; it is a spiritual discipline. It is *designed* to discover a human and divine presence. Its failure to find one in an AI text is not a failure of the method, but a successful diagnosis of the machine's profane nature.

### The Critical Pivot: The Method is a Moral Compass

The Romantic method doesn't have a "blind spot"; it has a conviction. Its foundational bias is that meaningful language comes from a soul. A text produced by a machine with no consciousness is, from this perspective, not a new kind of text, but a desecration. It is the logic of the "Mechanical Age" made manifest, an artifact of what Carlyle called a world that has "lost its belief in the Invisible."²

By insisting on the "psychological rail," the Romantic interpreter is not making a mistake. They are using their hermeneutic system as a moral compass. The compass needle spins wildly when pointed at AI, not because the compass is broken, but because it can find no true north. It finds only a radical, inhuman emptiness where a soul ought to be.

The boldest claim of Romantic hermeneutics is Schleiermacher's goal: to understand a work "better than [the author] understood himself."¹ This was an attempt to make an author's unconscious, divine inspiration explicit. But this entire project was part of the growth of another revolution. The Romantics' fiercest enemy was not a rival philosophy, but a new vision of the world: what Thomas Carlyle famously diagnosed as "the Mechanical Age."²

Carlyle's critique, like William Blake's of the "dark Satanic Mills," was not just about factories.³ It was about a world where "Men are grown mechanical in head and in heart," where living craft is replaced by the "speedier, inanimate one."² It was a spiritual crisis. The Romantics defined themselves in opposition to this deadening, mechanistic logic. Their entire worldview was a "Mental Fight" to defend the organic, the spiritual, and the divine human imagination against it.³

### The Ultimate Test

What happens, then, when we apply their ultimate interpretive principle to AI, the purest expression of the Mechanical Age they could have ever imagined? The answer is a judgment. We can, without question, understand an AI-generated text better than it understood itself, because the AI understood nothing. The act is meaningless.

The hermeneutic dialogue collapses into a monologue in a void. We find patterns, but they are the patterns of a soulless algorithm, not a striving human spirit. We reveal a "surplus," but it is entirely our own projection onto a blank, unthinking surface. The bridge Schleiermacher built to connect two souls leads off a cliff.

### Conclusion to the Series

This series set out to test the Romantic worldview against AI. What we found is that this worldview is not merely a set of aesthetic preferences, but a coherent and fierce spiritual resistance to the logic that produces AI. For Friedrich Schlegel, the highest form of art was the *Roman*, a "progressive universal poetry" that fused all genres into a living, organic whole, animated by a singular vision. It was a *Mischgedicht*, a 'mixed genre,' but one whose mixture was given meaning by a human soul striving to represent the world.⁴

Similarly, for American Transcendentalists like Emerson and Whitman, the catalogue was a form designed to enact a spiritual vision: its endless, open-ended list of particulars was unified by the divine Oversoul they believed was immanent in all things.⁵ An AI can generate an endless catalogue, but it is a list without a unifying spirit, a form emptied of its visionary purpose.

The Romantic method, when applied to AI, reveals AI as the final triumph of the Machine. It, too, produces a "Mischgedicht," a statistical slurry of every genre it has ingested. But it is a mixture without a vision, a combination without a soul. It is the ultimate "speedier, inanimate one," an engine of "rule and calculated contrivance" that perfectly mimics Romantic forms while negating their spirit.² The Romantic resistance to AI is not a sentimental attachment to the past. It is the original, foundational critique of the modern world finally meeting its ultimate antagonist. For the Romantics, AI would not be a tool. It would be the enemy.

post_number: 59

In earlier posts ([45](/post-45)-[50](/post-50)), I read the "Hero" music video from several angles. To conclude this "Reconsidering the Romantics" series, I want to return to it as a final stress-test, applying the rigorous method from our [**Romantic Quick Kit**](/romantic-quick-kit) to see not just what it reveals, but what it defends.

### Step 1 & 2: Running the Method (Hypothesis and The Two Rails)

- **Initial Hypothesis:** The video champions a quiet, modern Romantic hero.
- **Grammatical Rail:** The video uses the impersonal systems of the Cowboy Myth and the Pop Song Form.
- **Psychological Rail:** The specific choices (the fractured home, the messy trailer) undermine the generic templates. We can even give this a specific historical name from the German [*Sturm und Drang*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturm_und_Drang) tradition: the trope of the **"lonely soul against the world,"** now domesticated into a story of personal failure.

### Step 3: Turning the Circle (Synthesizing the Rails)

Here, the method works perfectly. The initial hypothesis of simple heroism is shattered by the evidence from the parts. We are forced to revise our understanding. The video's true subject is not simple heroism, but the **irresolvable tension** between the myth and the messy reality. The hermeneutic circle produces a richer, more human interpretation.

### Step 4 & The Critical Pivot: A Human Drama or a Soulless System?

Finally, we listen for surplus meaning. A Romantic reading concludes that the video performs the struggle of modern identity, the conflict between cultural myths and lived reality. This conflict is what gives the work its power.

But this is where we must apply pressure. The Romantic method, with its focus on the "psychological rail," forces us to locate this conflict *within a singular consciousness*: the director's vision, the character's struggle. The method's bias is to create a unified, psychologically coherent story of conflict.

Is this the most honest reading? A structuralist reading (as in [Post 50](/post-50)) would argue that there is no singular "consciousness" here to analyze. There is only the impersonal **collision of systems**: the visual code for "Hero" clashes with the visual code for "Broken Home." The tension is in the structure of the text, not in a person's soul.

The Romantic method gives us a compelling human drama. It does so by insisting on finding a human story, a soul in struggle. This final test reveals the method's greatest strength and its ultimate moral commitment. It is not a neutral tool with a "blind spot." It is a fierce defender of the human. It actively chooses to read for the soul, because the alternative is to surrender to the "dance of impersonal codes" and accept that we are living in the Mechanical Age.

### A Ricoeurian Counter-Reading: Unmasking the Ideology of "Heroism"

The Romantic reading, for all its power, is what Paul Ricoeur would call a "hermeneutics of recollection." It attempts to restore a noble, hidden meaning. But Ricoeur reminds us that another approach exists: the [hermeneutics of suspicion](/ai-kit-hermeneutics-of-risk). This method doesn't search for a soul to commune with; it tries to unmask the hidden ideologies and power structures that a text's surface conceals. From this perspective, the "Hero" video isn't a beautiful story of a struggling father; it's a sophisticated piece of cultural propaganda.

#### Beyond the Author's Mind: Distanciation and the World of the Text

First, a Ricoeurian reading would challenge the Romantic obsession with the author's mind. Ricoeur's concept of [distanciation](/ai-kit-distanciation) argues that the moment a work is written down (or, in this case, filmed), it achieves "semantic autonomy." It is cut off from the creator's intention. Our job is not to reconstruct the director's feelings but to interpret the [world of the text](/ai-kit-glossary), the reality that the video projects in front of itself.

The Romantic interpreter wants to fuse their soul with the author's. The Ricoeurian interpreter wants to critically investigate the world the video invites us to inhabit. This shifts the entire focus from psychological communion to ideological critique.

#### Suspicion as a Method: Unmasking the Sentimental

A hermeneutics of suspicion looks at the most emotional parts of the "Hero" video, the tender moments between father and daughter, and asks, "What function does this sentimentality serve?" The answer is that it works to conceal a harsh reality. The video presents the cowboy's dangerous, low-wage labor and fractured family life not as a systemic problem, but as the backdrop for a personal, emotional journey.

- **The Ideological Mask:** The story of a father's love becomes an ideological mask. It reframes economic precarity as a noble, character-building struggle. We are encouraged to feel sympathy for the individual, which prevents us from feeling anger at the system that creates these conditions. The "heroism" is in his personal endurance, not in any collective effort to change the world.
- **The Projected World:** The "world of the text" here is one in which systemic failures can be redeemed by individual sincerity and paternal love. It's a world where a quiet moment sharing ice cream is presented as a sufficient answer to a life of physical risk and financial instability. A suspicious reading argues this is a dangerous and politically conservative fantasy. It pacifies the viewer. It promises to be an emotional resolution to a problem that is fundamentally economic and political.

Where the Romantic reading finds a deep, authentic soul, the Ricoeurian reading finds a deep, effective ideology. The video's "surplus meaning" is not a glimpse into the human spirit, but a lesson in how culture uses the language of authenticity to neutralize social critique. The video isn't just a story; it's a machine for producing consent. The Romantic is moved by it. The suspicious interpreter asks who benefits from them being moved.

title: "Sleep Well! The Unconscious Arrogance of Medieval Sermon Technology"
post_number: 60
date: 2024-03-01

Imagine walking into a medieval bookstore and finding a sermon collection titled *Dormi secure* (literally, "Sleep Well!") This wasn't false advertising or wishful thinking. It was a frank acknowledgment of purpose: here was a book of ready-made sermons designed specifically so that "an overworked or under-trained priest" could "sleep without worry" on Saturday night. Sunday's sermon was handled. No struggle required.

I mentioned this detail in passing in my [earlier post](/post-27) about medieval postils, but it deserves its own meditation. The title "Sleep Well!" reveals something startling about medieval attitudes toward sermon production and something pretty revealing about our modern ones. Medieval Christians were comfortable with a technology that explicitly promised to eliminate pastoral anxiety about preaching. We are not.

The unconscious arrogance of *Dormi secure* is breathtaking when you think about it. The Church was frankly admitting that many of its priests were either too busy or too incompetent to prepare their own sermons. The solution wasn't better training or lighter workloads. It was a book that would let them sleep soundly while still delivering quality Sunday content. The message to the struggling priest was clear: your personal contribution to this week's sermon is not essential. What matters is that the Word gets preached, not who authored the words.

This is precisely the argument that AI sermon proponents make today, yet it feels like sacrilege to us in a way it apparently did not to our medieval predecessors. Why? The difference isn't theological. It's cultural. Somewhere between the medieval period and now, we absorbed the Romantic idea that authentic work must emerge from authentic personal struggle. We inherited the notion that a sermon's value depends not just on its content but on the [pastor's sincere wrestling](/post-26) with the text. The medieval Church clearly operated under different assumptions.

Consider what the "Sleep Well!" title tells us about medieval expectations. The priest's Saturday night rest was not seen as laziness but as practical wisdom. Why should every village priest reinvent the theological wheel when master theologians had already done the work? Why should the faithful suffer through amateur hour when professional-grade sermons were available in print? The postil system prioritized the congregation's need for solid teaching over the pastor's need for creative expression.

This utilitarian approach to preaching feels almost alien to modern sensibilities. We expect our pastors to be Romantic authors, pouring their souls onto the page each week. We want to feel their personal investment, their individual struggle with the text. A pastor who simply read a medieval "Sleep Well!" sermon would feel like a fraud to us, even if the sermon was superior to anything he could have written himself. We have convinced ourselves that authenticity requires personal authorship.

But the medieval Church's comfort with "Sleep Well!" sermons suggests that this equation of authenticity with individual authorship is not a theological necessity. It's a cultural preference we've absorbed from Romanticism. The unconscious arrogance of *Dormi secure* was not in its disregard for the pastor's soul but in its frank admission of what the system already knew: not everyone is called to be an original theologian, and that's perfectly fine.

Perhaps our modern anxiety about AI sermons reveals something about us rather than about the technology. We may be more invested in the drama of pastoral struggle than in the effectiveness of pastoral teaching. The medieval Church was willing to let priests "sleep well" if it meant the flock was fed well. We seem to prefer our shepherds sleep-deprived and stressed, as long as their exhaustion proves their authenticity.

title: "A Conflict of Interpretations: Ricoeur's Method for Reading AI"
post_number: 61
date: 2024-03-02
---

To make sense of any complex text, whether it's a dream, a myth, or an AI's output, we need a method. The philosopher Paul Ricoeur, in his landmark book *Freud and Philosophy*, provides one. He argues that modern interpretation is defined by a fundamental conflict between two opposing approaches. Understanding this conflict doesn't just clarify how we read old texts; it gives us a way to interpret the new texts generated by artificial intelligence.

### The Two Schools: Suspicion and Recollection

Ricoeur frames the landscape of interpretation as a battlefield between two "schools of thought."

First is the **hermeneutics of suspicion**. Its masters are Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. This approach treats the surface meaning of a text as a mask, a "false consciousness" that conceals a deeper, often less noble, reality. For the school of suspicion, to interpret is to unmask, to demystify, to reduce illusions. The goal is to look *through* the text to find the hidden forces (economic, psychological, or power-driven) that produced it. It is a reductive, "archeological" reading that digs down to the origins.

Opposing this is the **hermeneutics of recollection**. This school, which Ricoeur associates with the phenomenology of religion, approaches a text not as a mask to be torn off but as a symbol to be heard. It tries to restore a meaning that has been forgotten or obscured. For this school, a symbol is not just a disguise for something else; it's a "manifestation of a depth that both shows and hides itself." To interpret is to listen for a message, to aim for a "second naiveté" where the symbol "gives rise to thought." It is a restorative, "teleological" reading that looks forward to the meaning a text makes possible.

### A Preliminary Hermeneutic for AI Texts

Ricoeur's "conflict of interpretations" is not a problem to be solved but a tension to be inhabited. A robust hermeneutic for AI must consciously use both methods, moving between them in a dialectical dance.

We begin with the **hermeneutics of suspicion**. This is the natural starting point for any critical engagement with AI. We treat the AI's output as a product of hidden, non-human forces. We ask:

- What are the statistical patterns, biases, and limitations of its training data?
- How is the text merely a sophisticated fulfillment of my prompt?
- Where does it reveal its mechanical nature through generic phrasing, factual errors ("hallucinations"), or a lack of grounded understanding?

This reductive reading is essential. It's our "archeology," grounding our analysis in the material reality of the technology. It prevents us from naively anthropomorphizing the AI and treating its output as the product of a conscious mind.

But we cannot stop there. We must then pivot to the **hermeneutics of recollection**. We bracket the question of the AI's "intent" and instead treat its output as a cultural artifact, a symbol that can address us. We ask:

- What new thought does this text "give rise to" in me, the human interpreter?
- Does an unexpected metaphor or a strange connection reveal a latent cultural logic embedded in its vast training data—a "textual unconscious" of our collective language?
- How does the AI's response, even in its flaws, force me to clarify my own thinking and expand my own consciousness?

This restorative reading is our ["teleology."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology) It recognizes that meaning is not something contained *in* the AI but something created through our engagement with its output. The AI text, a product of a non-conscious, "archaic" process, becomes the occasion for a forward-looking, "teleological" expansion of our own understanding.

The true art of interpreting AI is to hold these two approaches in tension. We must be suspicious of the machine while remaining open to the meaning its strange new language can help us recollect. By embracing this conflict, we move beyond asking whether an AI can "mean" anything and begin the more fruitful work of discovering what can be meant *through* it.

title: "A Practical Method for Reading AI: Archaeology and Teleology"
post_number: 62

The [last post](/post-61) introduced Paul Ricoeur's core idea: modern interpretation is a "conflict" between a hermeneutics of suspicion and a hermeneutics of recollection. This isn't just an abstract theory; it provides the foundation for a practical, step-by-step method for engaging with AI-generated texts and chat. This method moves us beyond simple reactions ("Is it authentic? Is it bullshit?") and into the rigorous work of interpretation.

The method is a conscious, dialectical movement between two poles. Ricoeur calls this a movement between an *archeology* (a regressive analysis of a text's origins) and a *teleology* (a progressive analysis of the meaning it makes possible).

### Step 1: The Archeological Analysis (The School of Suspicion)

You must begin with a reductive, demystifying reading. This is the analysis of the AI text as a *mechanism*. The core question is: "Where does this text come from?" This is an act of suspicion. You are treating the text's fluent surface as a mask that conceals the non-human, statistical processes that generated it.

#### Key Questions for the Archeological Reading:

- **What are the traces of the training data?** Look for the seams. Can you identify specific clichés, ideological biases, or linguistic tics that point back to the vast, impersonal corpus of text the model was trained on? This is the equivalent of a Freudian analysis of the "archaic heritage" that speaks through the individual.
- **How is the text a function of the prompt?** Analyze your own prompt with suspicion. How did your word choices, your constraints, and your unstated assumptions pre-determine the output? The text is, in part, a mirror reflecting your own input back at you.
- **Where are the "symptoms" of the machine?** Identify the moments where the text reveals its non-human nature. This could be a "hallucination" (a factual error), a moment of nonsensical "word salad," or a strange, inhuman metaphor. These are not just flaws; they are crucial data about the nature of the machine's "thought." Ricoeur would call this the text's "energetics" and "economics." The raw, efficient process that underlies the apparent meaning.
- **What is being concealed?** The primary thing being concealed is the AI's profound indifference to truth and meaning. Your task is to identify how the text uses plausible language to mask this fundamental emptiness. This is the core of the "bullshit" critique, and it belongs firmly in the archeological stage.

This first step is crucial. It grounds your interpretation in the material reality of the technology and prevents you from naively anthropomorphizing the AI. It is an act of critical distance.

### Step 2: The Teleological Analysis (The School of Recollection)

Having established your critical distance, you must now pivot. You temporarily suspend your suspicion and treat the text not as a symptom of a machine, but as a *symbol* that addresses you, the interpreter. The core question is: "Where is this text going? What new meaning does it make possible *for me*?"

#### Key Questions for the Teleological Reading:

- **What thought does this text "give rise to"?** This is Ricoeur's key phrase. Even in its flaws, does the AI's output spark a new idea? Does a strange juxtaposition of concepts force you to see your own topic in a new light? This "surplus of meaning" is not in the AI; it is a product of your interaction with the text.
- **What latent cultural logic does it reveal?** The AI, in its unthinking recombination of linguistic patterns, can function as an instrument for revealing the hidden myths and metaphors of our culture. When an AI writes about business using the language of warfare, for example, it is revealing a deep structural metaphor in our collective "textual unconscious."
- **How does it advance my own "process of becoming conscious"?** In a chat interaction, the goal is not to get a perfect answer. The goal is to use the AI's responses as a tool to refine your own questions. Each inadequate or flawed response forces you to become more precise, more aware of your own assumptions. The AI becomes a catalyst for your own self-understanding.

This second step makes you the active and responsible center of interpretation. The meaning is not a pre-existing thing to be discovered in the AI, but a new thing to be created through your dialectical engagement with its output.

### Step 3: The Dialectical Movement in Practice

The real art of this hermeneutic method is not to choose one reading over the other, but to move fluidly between them. The tension is the point. For example:

1. Start with *archeology*: "This AI-generated poem is just a cliché-ridden product of its training data, [a blurry jpeg](/post-37) of a thousand other poems."
2. Discover a *teleological* possibility: "But the strange way it combined a technological metaphor with a natural one is something I've never seen before. That gives me a new idea."
3. Circle back to *archeology*: "This new idea wasn't 'created' by the AI, but was an accidental byproduct of its non-human, statistical method of combining words, a method a human writer, constrained by convention, might never have tried."
4. Arrive at a *dialectical synthesis*: "The AI text, a product of a non-conscious, 'archaic' linguistic process, has become the occasion for a forward-looking, 'teleological' expansion of my own creative consciousness."

By using this Ricoeurian pov-system, you move beyond the simplistic and unanswerable question, "Does the AI *mean* what it 'says'?" and begin to engage with the far more productive and philosophically rich question, "What can be meant *through* it?" You treat the AI not as a fraudulent author, but as an eloquent and deeply ambiguous cultural symbol that, above all, gives rise to thought.

After sixty-odd posts, you start to see patterns. This whole project has been an attempt to map a strange territory, to figure out why a technology like AI can feel so alien and pretty familiar at the same time. The arguments against it are often a replay of [Romantic anxieties](/post-9) about sincerity and soul. The arguments for it often rely on a [computational view of language](/post-41) that sees us as hosts for impersonal systems. It feels like we're stuck between two inherited worldviews, neither of which feels completely right.

Maybe it's time to zoom out. Forget the specific arguments for a minute and ask a simpler question: What is the right way to live with this thing? How do we orient ourselves to a technology that seems poised to reshape our world? It seems to me there are three possible stances we could take.

### 1. The Deep Opt-Out

This is the most intellectually honest form of protest. This position looks at AI and sees not just a new tool, but the final, perfect expression of a system that has been quietly replacing the human for centuries. It's the realization that the soulless, efficient, rationalizing logic of the machine didn't begin with LLMs. It began with the first bureaucracies, the first factories, the first attempts to render the world calculable and predictable.

From this perspective, to protest AI is to protest the entire modern project. It's a recognition that you can't coherently rage against ChatGPT on a smartphone you bought on a global supply chain after it was marketed to you by an algorithm. That's a profound hypocrisy. The deep opt-out requires a radical consistency. It means seeing the ["Romantic trace"](/post-21) not as a feeling to be defended, but as an after-image of some sort of a world we have already lost. The only authentic response is to reject the whole apparatus. It's a lonely, difficult, and perhaps impossible road, but it has the virtue of seeing the problem in its true scale.

### 2. Skate Along the Surface

This is the pragmatic, "don't get so worked up" approach. It looks at the breathless hype from both sides, the messianic claims of the AI boosters and the apocalyptic warnings of the critics, and rolls its eyes. It remembers a thousand other "next big things" that were supposed to change everything and didn't, or at least not in the ways anyone predicted. The Y2K bug, the Segway, the Metaverse. The world just keeps going.

This stance is a kind of strategic indifference. It argues that the best way to deal with the noise is to ignore it. Just do your work, use the tools that are useful, discard the ones that aren't, and refuse to get pulled into the dramatic hyperventilating. It suspects that both the utopian promises and the soul-stealing fears are mostly marketing from corporations that benefit from making us feel like history is ending. It's not cynical. It suggests we keep our heads down and wait for the fever to break.

### 3. The Deep Opt-In

This is a refusal to see technology as something alien or anti-human to begin with. It starts from the premise that to be human *is* to be technological. From the first sharpened stone to the first controlled fire, we have always been tool-makers. Our nature is to augment ourselves, to build systems that extend our reach and reshape our world. This has never been a safe or simple process.

Every major innovation has carried with it the twin possibilities of progress and destruction. The printing press spread both enlightenment and propaganda. Nuclear fission promised clean energy and delivered the bomb. This is just the human condition. This stance argues that opting out is not a real option; it's an abdication of responsibility. The only way forward is to renew our commitment to the messy, dangerous, and hopeful project of being human-plus-technology. It means engaging with AI not as an external threat, but as the next stage of our own evolution, with all the risks and responsibilities that entails. We have to participate, steer, and build the future, because the one thing we can't do is stop it from arriving.

I don't know which road is the right one. Maybe they're not mutually exclusive. I spend a lot of time trying to figure out which direction I'm pointed in.

I could be wrong. Obviously I don't know everyone, so I can't know how many people are like me on this one thing. And I don't literally mean "everyone." I know one or two people who agree with me on this.

That said, when it comes to public conversations out there on Youtube and the popular press, and when it comes to official pronouncements like policy guidelines and things like that, I am a complete outlier on this.

I am completely against this idea that seems common-sense for everyone else. I hate the idea that we should draw a clear line between things created by AI and things created by humans. I consider this a deeply wrongheaded invasion of the rights of authorship. As I see it, a fundamental power of every author is the hiddenness of their methods. I should not have to reveal how I made the thing I made in just the same way a magician should not have to reveal how they made their magic.

Immediately someone will reply. But the whole idea of the magician is a disclosure upfront that it's not real. We do require every magician to state at the outset, "Don't worry. This isn't real. It's a trick."

I'm against that too.

It's hard to track down the actual quote but there's anecdotal reporting that David Foster Wallace once said the following:

> I'm not that smart. I'm smart when I sit and think and have enough time; I'm not smart on the spot. I'm not smart when I'm scared. I'm not smart in front of five people with their eyes on me. But alone in a room — I can be a genius.

That's what I'm talking about. That's what I mean by the magic of an author. I shouldn't have to reveal any of my secrets about the muse I tap into when I go into that room and come back out with the written work. That's my business.

Going back to my [last post,](/post-64) why is there such unanimity on this point? Why does everyone act like it's so obvious. We just HAVE TO KNOW when we're talking to AI or looking at AI or reading something a human [poured their soul into](/romantic-kit-authenticity).

This coming from people who don't believe in souls.

But why? I'm trying to understand but it is really hard for me. I can't relate at all and I have really strong insticts that go the other way.

Maybe it's this. I *do* want to know if I'm interacting with a real human in real time physically right in front of me. I don't want to live in a world in which physical robots in physical space with me become indistinguishable from humans. I'm not ready to articulate why. But I share that impulse.

But once something has been separated from the physical human author or creator, it lives in a world of its own. It already becomes a kind of virtual thing. This is what authorship means. This is why Socrates was so fundamentally against the act of writing to begin with:

> I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately like painting; for the creations of the painter have the attitude of life, and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn silence. And when they have been once written down they are tumbled about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them, and know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or abused, they have no parent to protect them; and they cannot protect or defend themselves. —Plato, [*Phaedrus*](https://classics.mit.edu/Plato/phaedrus.html)

So the moment you put pen to paper, you've already crossed the line into the virtual. The text becomes an orphan, cut off from its human creator, an idea that gets a philosophical name with the concept of [distanciation](/ai-kit-distanciation). It doesn't matter whether a human or an AI wrote it; both are equally separated from their source once written.

So why this obsession with labeling? If we're already comfortable reading books by dead authors, [engaging with ideas that have been severed](/ai-kit-death-author) from their living creators for centuries, why does it suddenly matter so much whether the text was generated by biological or artificial intelligence? The separation Socrates worried about happened the moment writing was invented.

In my [last post](/post-65), I was thinking about Socrates and his critique of writing. The moment you write something down, it becomes an orphan, cut off from the living person who created it. This creates a problem for anyone who wants to draw a bright, sacred line between human-made texts and AI-made texts. The Socratic argument is that all written texts—human or not—are already separated from their source.

This line of thinking isn't new. I was looking through Augustine's classic work on interpretation, [*On Christian Doctrine*](https://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/Augustine%20doctrine.pdf), and he provides a heuristic for seeing a text not as a person, but as a system of signs.

Early in the book, Augustine makes a crucial distinction:

> All instruction is either about things or about signs; but things are learnt by means of signs... For a sign is a thing which, over and above the impression it makes on the senses, causes something else to come into the mind as a consequence of itself.

For Augustine, a written text is a collection of "conventional signs" (words) that we use to learn about "things" (ideas, concepts, the world). The reader's job isn't to have a [mystical communion with the author's soul](/romantic-kit-hermeneutics). The Whitman model I talked about in [Post 25](/post-25). The reader's job is to correctly interpret the system of signs to get at the meaning.

This is a profound shift in perspective. It treats the text as a kind of technology, a tool for conveying information. The whole process of reading becomes systematic, almost algorithmic. You learn the rules of the system (the language, the context) to decode the meaning. He lays it out like a method:

> ...we may proceed to open up and investigate the obscure passages, and in doing so draw examples from the plainer expressions to throw light upon the more obscure...

This is a hermeneutic based on the text's own internal structure, not on the reader's feeling of connection to the author. If a human-written text is already a detached system of signs that needs to be decoded, then an AI-generated text is just another system of signs. The hard line we want to draw between them starts to look pretty blurry. The fundamental task for the reader remains the same: interpret the signs to find the meaning. The "soul" of the author, as [Roland Barthes would later argue](/ai-kit-death-author), was never really the point.

So if we follow the argument from the [last post](/post-66), all texts, whether from a human or an AI, are fundamentally systems of signs detached from their origin. But this leads to the big objection: "Okay, but surely the *source* matters? Doesn't a text have to come from an [authentic human soul](/romantic-kit-authenticity) to be valuable?" This is the core of the [Romantic argument](/romantic-quick-kit) I've been wrestling with, and it's the reason I rejected "authenticity" as a necessary condition for art back in [Post 6](/post-6).

It turns out Augustine had an answer to this, long before the Romantics. In [*On Christian Doctrine*](https://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/Augustine%20doctrine.pdf), he deals with a similar problem: Should Christians use the wisdom found in pagan philosophy? His answer is a definitive yes, and he uses a brilliant analogy.

> Moreover, if those who are called philosophers... have said aught that is true and in harmony with our faith, we are not only not to shrink from it, but to claim it for our own use from those who have unlawful possession of it. For, as the Egyptians had not only the idols... but also vessels and ornaments of gold and silver... which the same people when going out of Egypt appropriated to themselves, designing them for a better use... in the same way all branches of heathen learning... contain also liberal instruction which is better adapted to the use of the truth...

This is the "appropriating the gold of the Egyptians" argument. Augustine radically separates the value of the content (the "gold," or truth) from the purity of its source. If a "pagan" can possess truth that a Christian can put to good use, why can't a non-human system generate text that a human can put to good use? The responsibility shifts from the origin of the text to the intention of the user. The value isn't in where it came from, but in what you do with it.

He doubles down on this idea when he discusses the problem of wicked preachers. Can a person who is "inauthentic" or lives a bad life still be a conduit for truth? Again, Augustine says yes.

> The man who speaks wisely and eloquently, but lives wickedly, may, it is true, instruct many who are anxious to learn... For though they seek their own objects, they do not dare to teach their own doctrines, sitting as they do in the high places of ecclesiastical authority, which is established on sound doctrine.

The truth of the sermon isn't guaranteed by the pastor's personal virtue, but by the "seat" he occupies, the system of language and doctrine he is transmitting. This is a very serious critique of the modern obsession with authenticity. If meaning can be transmitted through a corrupt human source, it can surely be transmitted through an a-moral, non-human one. An AI has no personal virtue *or* vice. It just generates text. It's up to us to occupy the "seat" of the interpreter, to provide the purpose, and to appropriate the "gold." This way of thinking treats the author not as a person, but as what Foucault would later call an ["author-function."](/ai-kit-author-function)

In the [last post](/post-67), I explored Augustine's idea that truth can be transmitted through an "inauthentic" source, like a wicked preacher. His point is that the value of a message isn't determined by the moral purity of the person who speaks it. This is a tough idea for us to accept. We have a deep instinct to be gatekeepers, to insist that good work can only come from an authorized, card-carrying member of our own group.

This instinct shows up in the Gospels. In the book of Mark, the disciple John comes to Jesus with a complaint. He's found someone operating outside their official circle, doing good work without the proper credentials.

> "Teacher," said John, "we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us." (Mark 9:38)

This is the classic insider complaint. "He's not one of us." The disciples' immediate reaction is to shut it down. They are acting as guardians of [authenticity](/romantic-kit-authenticity), believing that the power to do this work belongs exclusively to them. The source, in their view, is what legitimizes the action.

Jesus's response is a complete rejection of their gatekeeping. He turns their logic on its head:

> "Do not stop him," Jesus said. "For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, for whoever is not against us is for us." (Mark 9:39-40)

Jesus's criteria are radically different. He isn't concerned with the person's credentials or whether he's part of the "in-group." He's concerned with the outcome. Is a good thing happening? Is a demon being cast out? Does the work ultimately point toward him? If so, let it be. He judges the work by its fruits, not by the official status of the worker.

This is the same principle Augustine uses for his wicked preacher. Augustine argues that the truth of a sermon is guaranteed by the "seat" the preacher occupies, the system of doctrine he transmits. Jesus argues that the validity of the miracle is guaranteed by its result. Both arrive at the same conclusion: the work has an integrity of its own, separate from the [authenticity](/romantic-kit-authenticity) of the worker. Its meaning gains a kind of [semantic autonomy](/ai-kit-distanciation).

This gives us another lens for looking at AI. Our first, instinctual reaction is often the same as the disciples': "Stop it. It's not one of us." We see a machine driving out the "demons" of the blank page or creative block, and because it's not a human, we want to shut it down. But the challenge from both Jesus and Augustine is to shift our criteria. Instead of asking if the source is human, we should be asking: What are the fruits of this work? Can a good outcome be achieved? Can we, as Augustine said, appropriate its "gold" for a better purpose? It's a much harder and more interesting question than simply checking it for a human pulse.

title: "The Expert's Anxiety"
post_number: 69

The most insidious argument against AI isn't the outright ban; it's the expert's hedge. It's the voice of the teacher, the manager, the self-proclaimed critical thinker who says, "I can handle this tool responsibly, but I'm worried about the masses. The students. The public. *They* will be harmed by it."

This stance frames itself as care, but it's just the oldest form of gatekeeping, a transparent play to protect one's own authority. It's the same move the disciples made when they tried to shut down the unauthorized exorcist in the [last post](/post-68). The hypocrisy is so perfect it deserves a modern rewrite.

> Then John, a tenured professor, came to him and said, "Teacher, we've been using this new generative tool in our research. We know how to handle it. We can spot the bias, correct the hallucinations, and use it to enhance our productivity."
> 
> "But we see our students using it. They're taking its output at face value. They're losing their critical faculties. The amateurs are getting their hands on it, and they're making a mess. They don't have our training."
> 
> "So we told them to stop," John said. "We banned it in our syllabi. We called it academic dishonesty. We did this because they are not experts. Because they are not us."
> 
> But the Teacher replied, "Do not stop them. You cannot. To forbid the tool is to admit you have nothing left to teach. For no one who uses it to create something can in the next moment be wholly ignorant. The work is not to protect them from the tool but to make your own work more valuable than the tool's. For whoever is not against the project of making and thinking is for it."

Let's be clear about what's happening here. When the disciples saw the exorcist, they didn't see a miracle; they saw a threat to their exclusive franchise. Their concern wasn't for the man being healed; it was for their own status as the officially sanctioned miracle-workers. Their appeal to Jesus was a demand to enforce their monopoly.

The modern expert does the exact same thing. The fear isn't really that students will become lazy or misinformed. The deeper, unstated anxiety is that the tools of knowledge production are being spread around without a system for carefully monitoring things. The real fear is that the expert's role as the exclusive gatekeeper of information and analysis might become obsolete. The "concern for the students" is a convenient and noble-sounding mask for a raw defense of professional territory.

This isn't paternalism; it's a profound hypocrisy. It's claiming the right to use a powerful tool for yourself while denying it to the people you are supposed to be empowering. It is an abdication of the teacher's primary duty: to prepare students for the world they will actually live in, not the world we wish we still controlled. Banning AI in the classroom is a retreat from the real, difficult work of education. It's easier to forbid the future than to figure out how to teach in it.

The challenge from Jesus and Augustine is to stop obsessing over the credentials of the user and start looking at the quality of the work. Our job is not to protect our students from tools. It is to make ourselves, as teachers, more relevant and more necessary than the tools they can use without us.

title: "The Parasite in the Machine: A Lacanian Reading of Elan Barenholtz"
post_number: 70
date: 2024-03-11

So I've been mapping a conflict in this notebook. Our collective anxiety over AI, I've argued, is a new playing-out of an intellectual battle between a Romantic worldview, which prizes the authentic, unified soul, and a structuralist worldview, which sees us as hosts for impersonal systems. This may not be just a battle between two theories. The impersonal system may be something we can now observe directly.

The work of cognitive scientist Elan Barenholtz adds a concrete, 21st-century update to this debate. His analysis of LLMs has led him to the "uncomfortable realization" that language is an autonomous, "parasitic" system inside our heads, creating a profound split between the "speaking me" and the "feeling me".

This seems like a brand new thing, and Barenholtz talks about it like it's a brand new thing. But it's actually an independent (possible) confirmation of a theory developed a while ago during fights about the nature of psychoanalysis. For the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, Barenholtz's "uncomfortable realization" wouldn't count as a new discovery prompted by AI. It's the fundamental, unavoidable starting point of what it means to be a human subject.

### The "Problematic I" and Lacan's Split Subject

Barenholtz, by taking the logic of LLMs seriously, arrives at a moment of philosophical realization. He sees that if language is a self-contained system running on our cognitive hardware, then the foundation of our sense of self becomes more complex than we typically assume. The unified "I" reveals itself as a set of distinct, and perhaps disconnected, functions.

> *"...the word 'I' suddenly becomes problematic [...] and all of that immediately [...] gets very hairy sort of philosophically... you suddenly get into these weird dualities"* [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9QWvmrWPZE&t=724s)

This "hairy" philosophical problem is exactly where Lacan starts. In his essay "On the Subject who Is Finally in Question," he attacks the "mirage of the 'completeness of the subject'" as a fantasy. For Lacan, the subject isn't a unified thing. We are all fundamentally split the moment we learn to speak.

The "I" *is* problematic because the "I" who is speaking is never the same person as the "I" being described. This isn't a bug; it's just a fact of the human situation. It's a direct challenge to the whole [Romantic worldview](/romantic-quick-kit) I've been tracking, which needs to believe in a single, unified soul pouring its meaning out. Lacan gives a formal structure to Barenholtz's "weird dualities," showing that the ghost in the machine isn't a new problem.

### The "Collective System" and the Discourse of the Other

Barenholtz pushes his insight further when he realizes that this autonomous language system doesn't truly belong to him. It is a shared, social inheritance.

> *"...my feelings are my own... but ideas Concepts all of these things that are the lifeblood of language they don't actually belong to my brain they don't belong to my body they belong to some collective system some informational system that is larger than me"* [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIMw04GJJ7U&t=1059s)

This is a perfect description of something Lacan has his own theory of. The "collective system" that Barenholtz identifies is, in Lacanian terms, the Symbolic Order, the pre-existing treasury of words, laws, and cultural structures that we are all born into. As Lacan formulates it, "the unconscious is the discourse of the Other". Our thoughts don't actually belong to our brain because we can only think with the words and concepts given to us by the Other. Lacan provides the theory for the "informational organism" Barenholtz senses living outside of him (while also somehow being inside of him).

### The "Magic" of Language and the Itinerary of the Signifier

Maybe the weirdest thing we've learned from LLMs is that true intelligence seems to just fall out of a good enough communication engine. Barenholtz puts it perfectly:

> *"...the thinking machine. Wow. That's the magic part. And it turns out no like actually just make the communications engine and the ability to play chess and write computer programs and solve logic will just fall out of that"* [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9QWvmrWPZE&t=724s)

This "magic" is the trick Lacan explains in his "Seminar on 'The Purloined Letter.'" He gives us a blueprint for how it works. The whole drama of Poe's story (the power plays, the acts of blindness and genius) is generated not by the characters' inner minds, but by the movement of a "pure signifier": the letter itself. Its content doesn't matter. What matters is its itinerary, its path through the system.

The "intelligence" that writes a program or plays chess "falls out" of the system because the system itself (the signifying chain) is what produces these effects. The characters in the story don't need to be smart; they just need to occupy their assigned place in the structure the letter creates for them. Lacan's analysis is an alredy-existing model (whether it happens to be empirically true or not) for how an impersonal system can generate results that look and feel like "thought."

Barenholtz's claims about cognitive psychology come from observing 21st-century technology. He's putting ideas out there that resemble the core principles Lacan was developing decades earlier by reading Freud. What Lacan's work describes is an "alien intelligence" or "informational parasite" we now see in AI. The theories might be wrong. But they sound really similar, which is fascinating.

title: "Schleiermacher's Divided Self: A Romantic Who Knew We Weren't Whole"
post_number: 71
date: 2024-03-12
---

For a while now, this blog has been tracking what I call the ["Romantic trace"](/post-21) in our debates about AI. I've argued that our anxieties about authenticity and soulless machines are a replay of a worldview we inherited from the 1800s. In my series ["Reconsidering the Romantics,"](/post-53) I tried to build a more rigorous version of this worldview to avoid attacking a strawman. Now it's time to go back to one of the sources: Friedrich Schleiermacher, a foundational figure of German Romanticism.

His 1800 book, [*Soliloquies*](https://dn720002.ca.archive.org/0/items/schleiermacherss00schl/schleiermacherss00schl.pdf), is a classic Romantic text, his exploration of the "inner life." But when you read it closely, the "self" he describes isn't the simple, unified, authentic soul we might expect. Schleiermacher's subject is far stranger, more complex, and more useful for our current moment. It is a self that is relational, functionally divided, and perpetually under construction.

### 1. The Self is Not an Atom; It's a Relationship

The caricature of the Romantic individual is a solitary genius, an isolated soul generating meaning from within. Schleiermacher's model is the exact opposite. For him, individuality isn't something you *have* in isolation; it's something you *achieve* through connection and contrast. A self, to be a self, requires an Other.

He writes that a person can only maintain consciousness of their unique selfhood if they constantly "survey the whole of humanity, opposing his own expression of it to every other possible one." He states it even more plainly:

> **Contrast is indispensable to set individuality in relief.**

This is a really modern, almost structuralist idea. Like Saussure's theory that the meaning of a word comes from its difference from all other words, Schleiermacher's self is defined not by its essence, but by its position within a system of relations. He argues that without "love" and "sensitiveness" (the faculties for engaging with others) the project of self-formation would be impossible, "shattering because of the frightful disproportion between giving and receiving." The self isn't a pre-existing thing; it's an effect that emerges from a network of differences.

### 2. The Inner Blossom and the Outer Fruit: A Functional Division

The Romantic ideal (or caricature) I've been critiquing is that of total sincerity, a perfect alignment between a person's inner feeling and their outer action. Schleiermacher presents a more pragmatic, functionally divided model. In his final soliloquy, he argues that we should "marry" the eternal principles of Youth and Age within ourselves.

- **The Inner Self (Youth):** This part should be eternally "young, tender, plastic, impressionable, forever growing and blooming." It is the site of feeling, imagination, and spontaneous development. It operates without rules, driven by "inner impulse with a gracious and perfect joy."
- **The Outer Self (Age):** This is the self that interacts with the world. It should be governed by "sober wisdom, cool self-possession, a rich experience." It produces "sound fruit, ripened and well-seasoned in the cool deliberation of mature wisdom."

This isn't a hypocrisy. It's a strategic division of labor. The inner world is a space of absolute freedom and becoming, while the outer world is a space of strategic, careful action. This model offers a fascinating way to think about AI. One could argue that AI is a tool for the "outer self" (an instrument for producing "fruit" for the world (drafting emails, organizing data, generating code)) while leaving the "inner" space of impression and feeling untouched. The fear of AI corrupting the authentic soul rests on the assumption that the soul must be a unified, transparent whole. Schleiermacher's model suggests the self has always been a more complex and functionally divided machine.

### 3. The Unfinished Self

Finally, Schleiermacher's self is not a stable entity to be "expressed." It is a project that is never finished. The *Soliloquies* are not a declaration of who he is, but an ongoing investigation. He admits,

> "the picture of my individuality does not yet present itself to me complete in all its features, and is not yet certified by an unbroken continuity of clear self-consciousness."

This is the Romantic idea of *Bildung* (formation or self-cultivation) in its purest form. The self is a text that is constantly being written and rewritten. This resonates with the post-structuralist ideas I've explored from thinkers like [Judith Butler](/ai-kit-butler-performativity). If the self is not a pre-existing "doer behind the deed" but is performatively constituted, then Schleiermacher's "crisis-autobiography" is a pretty strong example of performance in action. He is creating his "self" in the act of trying to interpret it.

### What Schleiermacher Gives Us

Going back to this foundational Romantic text doesn't reinforce the sentimental caricature. It torques it a bit. Puts pressure on it. Schleiermacher gives us a model of the human subject that's relational, functionally divided, and perpetually in process. This is a self that's better equipped to survive in the world I've been trying to map out here.

### Part I: The Project: Goal and Sources

#### A. The Central Analogy and My Goal

**My Goal:** To use the contemporary, concrete act of AI data poisoning ([here's just one example of many videos about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTqlSunIolI&t=3s)) as a master analogy to unlock the challenging but profound philosophical project of Gilles Deleuze.

All of this popped into my mind while reading *Philosophy After Deleuze* by Joe Hughes and remembering things I've seen about data poisoning. I think there's an interesting parallel between what the data poisoners see themselves as doing and what Deleuze thinks the creative thinker or philosopher is doing in modern societies.

**The Power of the Analogy:** Deleuze's method can seem abstract and intentionally obscure. This analogy provides a tangible key by grounding his strategies in a real-world conflict with clear tactics and ethical stakes.

- **The Shared Target:** Both the digital artist and Deleuze target a system that operates through **recognition and reproduction**. The AI model scrapes and reproduces existing artistic styles; traditional philosophy, in Deleuze's view, reproduces "common sense" and recognizes ideas only by comparing them to what is already known. Both are closed systems that resist genuine novelty.
- **The Shared Tactic: Subversion from Within.** Neither the artist nor Deleuze attacks from the outside. They practice a form of "poisoning" that uses the system's own logic against it. The artist creates a "Trojan Horse," an image that looks appealing to the AI scraper but contains hidden data designed to corrupt it. Similarly, Deleuze performs "ventriloquism," inhabiting the language of another philosopher (like Kant or Spinoza) only to introduce a "monstrous" difference that corrupts the traditional understanding from within.
- **The Shared Outcome: Generative Failure.** The goal is not a system crash but a **generative failure**. The poisoned AI, when prompted, produces "pure mush," a monstrous, useless creation. Deleuze's readings produce a "monstrous offspring," a concept that is no longer purely Kantian or Spinozist, but a new tool that forces the philosophical system to produce something it wasn't designed for. In both cases, the system's reproductive capacity is turned against itself to create a testament to its own internal corruption.
- **The Ethical Motive:** This is not nihilism. The artist's "vendetta" is an ethical defense of human creativity against automated extraction ("stolen labor"). Deleuze's project is equally affirmative: it is a defense of vital, creative thinking against a "dogmatic image of thought" that he believes impoverishes life. The "poison" is a necessary act of clearing space for **new and more joyful possibilities of life.**

By keeping this analogy in mind, Deleuze's most difficult concepts become strategic maneuvers in a creative and ethical war against reactive, cliché-ridden thought.

#### B. The Primary Texts

This plan draws from the two key Deleuzian texts cited and analyzed by Joe Hughes.

- *Nietzsche and Philosophy* (1962)

  **Role in this Plan:** This is the book of **motive and method**. It is Deleuze's most direct and passionate statement of his ethical project. It clearly lays out the critical tools (genealogy, active vs. reactive) and the ultimate goal: to liberate thought so it can affirm life and create new values. It is the best starting point for understanding *why* Deleuze does what he does.

- *Difference and Repetition* (1968)

  **Role in this Plan:** This is Deleuze's magnum opus, the book of **systematic critique and ontology**. It contains the deep, technical deconstruction of the "dogmatic image of thought," the system he's trying to poison. It details the mechanisms of representation he is fighting against and lays the groundwork for a new philosophy based on difference in itself, not difference subordinated to identity.

### Part II: The Intermediate Plan: A Curated Tour of 48 Passages

Before reading the books in their entirety, this sequence of passages will provide me with a conceptual scaffolding. It is organized into a five-part narrative that mirrors the logic of Deleuze's project.

#### Section 1: Diagnosing the Problem: The Dogmatic Image of Thought

*(We begin by identifying the target (the established system of thought that operates on unexamined presuppositions.))*

**1. The Presupposition of a Good Will in Thinking**
> *"According to this image, thought has an affinity with the true; it formally possesses the true and materially wants the true. It is in terms of this image that everybody knows and is presumed to know what it means to think."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 131

**Gloss:** This is the foundational assumption of traditional philosophy. Hughes identifies this postulate of "Goodwill" as Deleuze's primary target, which his adversarial style is designed to overturn.

**2. Recognition as the Model of Thought**
> *"Recognition may be defined by the harmonious exercise of all the faculties upon a supposed same object... It is the common sense become philosophical."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 133

**Gloss:** Deleuze argues that philosophy mistakes simple recognition for genuine thinking. This model, which presupposes a stable subject recognizing a stable object, can never produce anything new. It is the AI model's logic of pattern-matching.

**3. The True Enemy of Thought: Stupidity, Not Error**
> *"Stupidity is a structure of thought as such... Stupidity is not error or a tissue of errors. There are imbecile thoughts, imbecile discourses, that are made up entirely of truths; but these truths are base, they are those of a base, heavy and leaden soul."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 105

**Gloss:** The "poisoning" is not aimed at correcting mere falsehoods. It targets *bêtise* (stupidity)—a way of thinking that can be factually correct but is creatively and ethically impotent.

**4. The Genesis of Real Thinking: The Violent Encounter**
> *"Something in the world forces us to think. This something is an object not of recognition but of a fundamental encounter... Thought is primarily trespass and violence, the enemy, and nothing presupposes philosophy: everything begins with misosophy."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 139

**Gloss:** This is Deleuze's alternative. True thinking is involuntary, forced upon us by a "violent encounter" with something we *cannot* recognize. This is the conceptual "poison" that breaks our cognitive habits.

#### Section 2: Forging the Weapons: Style and Method

*(Having identified the target, Deleuze fashions his tools. His method is one of active interpretation and creative combat.)*

**5. Philosophy with a Hammer**
> *"The philosophy of sense and values had to be a critique... the only way in which a total critique may be realised, the only way to 'philosophise with a hammer'."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 1

**Gloss:** Deleuze's project is not a gentle inquiry but a forceful, active critique. The "hammer" is a diagnostic tool used to test the soundness of philosophical concepts, to see if they are hollow or full of life.

**6. The Philosopher as Physician and Symptomatologist**
> *"The whole of philosophy is a symptomatology, and a semeiology. The sciences are a symptomatological and semeiological system."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 3

**Gloss:** The philosopher's role is to diagnose the health or sickness of a culture by interpreting its concepts as "symptoms" of underlying forces.

**7. Critique as Positive Creation**
> *"Genealogy means both the value of origin and the origin of values... But, understood in this way, critique is also at its most positive. The differential element is both a critique of the value of values and the positive element of a creation."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 2

**Gloss:** Critique is not merely negative. For Deleuze, to critique a value is to trace it back to its origin and, in doing so, to create a new way of evaluating.

**8. The New Question: Not "What is?" but "Which one?"**
> *"The question 'which one?' (qui) means this: what are the forces which take hold of a given thing, what is the will that possesses it? Which one is expressed, manifested and even hidden in it? We are led to essence only by the question: which one?"*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, pp. 3, 77

**Gloss:** This is the fundamental question of genealogy. It shifts philosophy from a search for abstract, timeless essences ("What is Truth?") to a concrete diagnosis of the forces at play in any given thing ("Which will seeks truth?").

**9. Philosophy as Attack, Not Revenge**
> *"Critique is not a re-action of ressentiment but the active expression of an active mode of existence; attack and not revenge, the natural aggression of a way of being..."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 3

**Gloss:** This clarifies the motive. The destructive aspect of his method is an "attack" born from an overflowing, affirmative force, not the spiteful "revenge" of a reactive one.

**10. The History of Philosophy as Theatre**
> *"In the history of philosophy, a commentary should act as a veritable double and bear the maximal modification appropriate to a double. (One imagines a philosophically bearded Hegel, a philosophically clean-shaven Marx...)"*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. xxi (Preface)

**Gloss:** Hughes's concept of "ventriloquism" comes directly from this idea. Deleuze treats past philosophers as masks or characters through which he can create a new, "monstrous" philosophical performance.

**11. Pluralism as the Core of Philosophy**
> *"Pluralism (otherwise known as empiricism) is almost indistinguishable from philosophy itself... the only principle of a violent atheism."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 4

**Gloss:** Deleuze rejects any philosophy based on the "One" or the "Same." His world is a multiplicity of forces and perspectives, which is why he must attack any system that claims a single, unifying Truth.

**12. The Inversion of Platonism**
> *"Overturning Platonism, then, means denying the primacy of original over copy, of model over image; glorifying the reign of simulacra and reflections."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 67

**Gloss:** The ultimate goal of his method is to dismantle the hierarchy that privileges a "true" world of models over our world of appearances. He champions the "simulacrum" (the copy without an original) as a site of creative power.

#### Section 3: The Diagnostic Tools: Active vs. Reactive and *Ressentiment*

*(Here are the core concepts Deleuze uses to analyze the forces at play in morality, culture, and thought itself.)*

**13. The Body and Its Forces**
> *"What defines a body is this relation between dominant and dominated forces... In a body the superior or dominant forces are known as active and the inferior or dominated forces are known as reactive."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 40

**Gloss:** This is the foundation of his analysis. Everything is a composition of forces, and the first task is to evaluate the quality—active or reactive—of these forces.

**14. Active Force Affirms Difference**
> *"In its relation with the other the force which makes itself obeyed does not deny the other... it affirms its own difference and enjoys this difference."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, pp. 8-9

**Gloss:** Active forces are the forces of creation. They act from their own power and affirm what they are. Their "aggression" is a consequence of their affirmation.

**15. Reactive Force and the Triumph of the Weak**
> *"Reactive forces do not become active but, on the contrary, they make active forces join them and become reactive in a new sense... they separate active force from what it can do."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 57

**Gloss:** This is the poisoning mechanism of reactive forces. They don't win by becoming stronger; they win by making the strong "sick"—by separating them from their own power.

**16. *Ressentiment*: The Engine of Slave Morality**
> *"The slave morality from the outset says No to what is 'outside', what is 'different' what is 'not itself' and this No is its creative deed."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 10

**Gloss:** *Ressentiment* is the psychological state of reactive forces. It is a logic that begins with negation ("You are evil, therefore I am good") and needs an external enemy to define itself.

**17. The Passive Synthesis of Habit**
> *"Time is constituted only in the originary synthesis which operates on the repetition of instants. This synthesis contracts the successive independent instants into one another, thereby constituting the lived, or living, present."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 70

**Gloss:** This is the unconscious machinery of thought. Before any active recognition, our minds are already passively contracting time and forming habits. This is the deep, cellular level at which "poisoning" can be most effective.

**18. The Dissolved Self**
> *"Selves are larval subjects; the world of passive syntheses constitutes the system of the self... but it is the system of a dissolved self."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 73

**Gloss:** The unified "I" is an illusion. We are composed of thousands of passive, "larval" selves. This deconstruction of the subject is crucial for escaping the "dogmatic image of thought."

**19. The Paradox of Learning**
> *"We never know in advance how someone will learn... Method is the means of that knowledge which regulates the collaboration of all the faculties... Culture, however, is an involuntary adventure."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 165

**Gloss:** True learning is not methodical. It is an "involuntary adventure" sparked by an encounter that forces us to think.

#### Section 4: The Creative Core: Will to Power and Ideas

*(This is Deleuze's positive alternative. He redefines Will to Power as a creative force and Ideas as problematic structures, not stable concepts.)*

**20. Will to Power Is NOT the Desire for Power**
> *"Power is therefore not what the will wants, but on the contrary, the one that wants in the will."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. xi (Preface)

**Gloss:** The most crucial redefinition. Will to Power is not a psychological drive for domination but the ontological principle of difference itself.

**21. Will to Power as a "Plastic Principle"**
> *"The will to power... is an essentially plastic principle that is no wider than what it conditions, that changes itself with the conditioned..."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 50

**Gloss:** Will to Power is an immanent, not transcendent, principle. It is plastic and adapts to every situation.

**22. Will to Power as Genetic Element**
> *"The will to power is the genealogical element of force, both differential and genetic."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 50

**Gloss:** The technical definition. Will to Power is the deep structure that generates the differences between forces and their qualities.

**23. The Will to Power Gives, It Does Not Take**
> *"In this way the will to power is essentially creative and giving: it does not aspire... it does not desire power. It gives..."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 85

**Gloss:** This completes the redefinition. The Will to Power is a principle of generosity, an overflowing force that bestows sense and value.

**24. Ideas as Problems, Not Solutions**
> *"Problems are the differential elements in thought, the genetic elements in the true. We can therefore substitute for the simple point of view of conditioning a point of view of effective genesis."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 162

**Gloss:** Deleuze redefines Ideas not as stable concepts or answers, but as problematic structures. Real thought happens when we engage with the problem itself, not just search for a pre-packaged solution.

**25. Ideas and the Unconscious**
> *"Problems-Ideas are by nature unconscious: they are extra-propositional and sub-representative..."*
> — Conclusion, p. 267

**Gloss:** Ideas are not things we consciously possess. They are the unconscious, virtual structures that generate thought.

#### Section 5: The Ultimate Test and Goal: Eternal Return and Affirmation

*(The entire project culminates in an ethical vision. The Eternal Return is the selective test for an affirmative life, and the Overman is the figure capable of living it.)*

**26. The Eternal Return as a Selective Thought**
> *"Whatever you will, will it in such a way that you also will its eternal return."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 68

**Gloss:** The Eternal Return is not a fact but an ethical rule. It is a selective principle that filters out all half-willed, reactive actions.

**27. The Eternal Return Selects Being**
> *"Only action and affirmation return... The negative... the reactive... do not return because they are the opposite of becoming..."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, pp. xi-xii (Preface)

**Gloss:** The test is also ontological. Only that which is active and affirmative is worthy of being, and capable of "returning."

**28. The Game of the Dicethrow**
> *"The dice which are thrown once are the affirmation of chance, the combination which they form on falling is the affirmation of necessity."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, pp. 25-26

**Gloss:** The central metaphor for the creative act. It is a single throw that affirms all of chance in order to create a new necessity.

**29. The Tragic is Joyful**
> *"According to Nietzsche it has never been understood that the tragic = the joyful... The dicethrow is tragic."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 36

**Gloss:** Tragedy is not about suffering, but the joy of affirming chance and necessity. It is the ethic of the creator.

**30. To Will = To Create**
> *"The glad tidings are tragic thought... This is another way of putting the great equation: to will = to create."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 36

**Gloss:** The highest expression of the Will is not domination but creation.

**31. The Aim of Critique is the Overman**
> *"The aim of critique is not the ends of man or of reason but in the end the Overman... The point of critique is not justification but a different way of feeling: another sensibility."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 94

**Gloss:** Philosophy's goal is to create the conditions for man to overcome himself by achieving a new, affirmative "way of feeling."

**32. The Overman Laughs**
> *"'He was transformed, surrounded with light, he was laughing! Never yet on earth had any man laughed as he laughed'... Another becoming, another sensibility: the Overman."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 65

**Gloss:** Laughter is the expression of pure affirmation. The Overman is the one who can laugh in the face of the Eternal Return, affirming everything.

**33. Transmutation: Changing the Element of Values**
> *"We know what transmutation... means for Nietzsche: not a change of values, but a change in the element from which the value of values derives. Appreciation instead of depreciation, affirmation as will to power..."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 171

**Gloss:** The ultimate creative act. It's not about new morals, but about a new source for all valuation, shifting from negation to affirmation.

**34. The New Image of Thought**
> *"A new image of thought means primarily that truth is not the element of thought. The element of thought is sense and value."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 104

**Gloss:** The final goal is a new image of thought where philosophy is no longer a search for truth but an evaluation of forces and a creation of values.

**35. The Ethical Goal: Inventing New Possibilities of Life**
> *"Thinking would then mean discovering, inventing new possibilities of Life."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 101

**Gloss:** The ultimate, affirmative motive. The entire destructive and critical apparatus of Deleuze's philosophy is in the service of this single goal: to free thought to create new, more joyful ways of living.

**36. The Secret of Repetition**
> *"The secret repetition surrounds itself with a mechanical and bare repetition as though this were the final barrier..."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 289

**Gloss:** The overt, mechanical repetitions of our lives (habits, clichés) are merely the outer shell. The real work of thought is to connect with the secret, creative repetition of difference that lies beneath.

**37. Repetition as the Category of the Future**
> *"A philosophy of repetition must pass through all these 'stages'... making repetition the category of the future."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 94

**Gloss:** Deleuze's three syntheses of time are part of an ethical project to move beyond the repetitions of the past (Memory) and present (Habit) to a creative repetition of the future (Eternal Return).

**38. The Divine Game**
> *"The divine game... First, there is no pre-existent rule, since the game includes its own rules. As a result, every time, the whole of chance is affirmed in a necessarily winning throw."*
> — Conclusion, p. 283

**Gloss:** The ultimate vision of the Eternal Return is a game where every throw is a winning throw because it affirms the totality of chance.

**39. Is Man Essentially Reactive?**
> *"What constitutes man and his world is... the becoming-reactive of all forces..."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 167

**Gloss:** This is the core problem of humanity. Man is the being in whom active forces have become reactive. The Overman is the figure who reverses this process.

**40. Negation becomes a Power of Affirmation**
> *"Negation transformed into a power of affirmation, the supreme Dionysian metamorphosis."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 71

**Gloss:** This is the essence of transmutation. The critical "no" becomes a tool in the service of a greater, creative "yes."

**41. Thought and the Fracture**
> *"...the death of God, the fractured I and the passive self."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 87

**Gloss:** The breakdown of the unified subject ("I") is not a failure but the condition for the emergence of real, creative thought.

**42. The Secret of Philosophy**
> *"Philosophy's mystification begins, however, from the moment it renounces its role as demystifier and takes the established powers into consideration: when it gives up the harming of stupidity and the denunciation of baseness."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 106

**Gloss:** A clear statement of Deleuze's view of philosophy's duty. Its role is to be critical, to attack stupidity and baseness, not to justify the established order.

**43. The Link between Repetition and Difference**
> *"Repetition in the eternal return is the same, but the same in so far as it is said uniquely of difference and the different. This is a complete reversal of the world of representation..."*
> — Conclusion, p. 301

**Gloss:** The two core concepts come together. The Eternal Return is not the repetition of the "Same," but the repetition of difference itself.

**44. The Power of the False**
> *"Art is the highest power of falsehood, it magnifies the 'world as error', it sanctifies the lie; the will to deception is turned into a superior ideal."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 102

**Gloss:** Deleuze embraces the "false" not as error, but as the creative power of art and thought to invent new realities.

**45. Philosophy Against its Time**
> *"This is why philosophy has an essential relation to time: it is always against its time, critique of the present world. The philosopher creates concepts that are neither eternal nor historical but untimely..."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 107

**Gloss:** The philosopher is not a chronicler of their time, but an "untimely" creator of concepts that disrupt the present in the name of a future to come.

**46. The Universal Ungrounding**
> *"The ground has been superseded by a groundlessness, a universal ungrounding which turns upon itself and causes only the yet-to-come to return."*
> — Difference and Repetition, p. 91

**Gloss:** The ultimate goal is to move beyond any fixed foundation (God, the Self, the Cogito) to a creative "groundlessness" from which new thoughts can emerge.

**47. Thinking Without an Image**
> *"The thought which is born in thought, the act of thinking which is neither given by innateness nor presupposed by reminiscence but engendered in its genitality, is a thought without image."*
> — Conclusion, p. 167

**Gloss:** This is the goal: to achieve a way of thinking that is not governed by the pre-existing "dogmatic image," a thought that is a pure act of creation.

**48. Philosophy's Task: To Harm Stupidity**
> *"The use of philosophy is to sadden. A philosophy that saddens no one, that annoys no one, is not a philosophy. It is useful for harming stupidity, for turning stupidity into something shameful."*
> — Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 106

**Gloss:** A strong concluding statement on motive. Philosophy's critical duty is to be aggressive, to attack the thoughtlessness that underpins our lives, in order to make space for genuine thought.

### Part III: How to Proceed: My Reading Strategy

1. **Read This Document:** Familiarize myself with the overall narrative arc presented in the passages. Let the analogy of "intellectual poisoning" be my guide. See if I can map the artist's tactics (Trojan Horse, attacking weak points, corrupting the dataset) onto Deleuze's concepts.

2. **Read *Nietzsche and Philosophy*:** Start here. It is the more direct, passionate, and polemical of the two books. It will ground me firmly in Deleuze's ethical and creative motivations. As I read, keep the passages from this book in mind as signposts to the core arguments of each chapter.

3. **Read *Difference and Repetition*:** With the motive from *Nietzsche and Philosophy* clear, I can now tackle this more systematic and challenging work. Use the selected passages as anchors. When I encounter the difficult sections on the three syntheses of time or the critique of representation, refer back to the relevant quotes and glosses in this guide. The passages will help me see that this complex machinery is all in the service of the ethical project I've already understood.

4. **Revisit the Analogy:** As I read both books, continually ask myself: How is this argument a form of "intellectual poisoning"? Where is the "Trojan Horse"? What is the "degraded output" Deleuze is trying to produce in the reader's mind?

This approach will allow me to use the curated passages as a map, transforming what can be a disorienting experience into a guided exploration of one of the most creative philosophical projects of the 20th century.

#### A final little question: is there a version of this motivated by love for the system and everyone living in it? Is there a version of this that is being in the world but not of the world? Is that a version of the analogy?

A familiar drama plays out with increasing regularity in our cultural life: an artist is accused of a moral transgression, and a public debate erupts. The question is always the same: can we, or should we, separate the art from the artist? The resulting boycotts and refusals are often framed as a uniquely modern phenomenon, a product of social media and "cancel culture." But the intensity of these debates, the profound sense of personal betrayal and moral urgency, suggests a deeper source.

This series will argue that these contemporary reactions are not new at all. They are the logical outcome of an intellectual point of view we inherited from the Romantic era. The way we conceive of art, authorship, and even our own ethical integrity emerged from a revolutionary period of thought that began over two centuries ago. Our modern debates are, in a sense, a performance of a Romantic drama, powered by an intellectual architecture that remains largely invisible to us.

The purpose of these posts is not to argue for or against the boycott. The goal is genealogical. As I've tried to do before when mapping the ["Romantic trace,"](/post-21) I want to uncover this intellectual lineage. The moral grammar we use to condemn or defend, the anxieties about "inauthenticity" and "profaned communion" that I sketched out in my definition of ["Romantic Evil,"](/post-9) are not timeless truths. They are historically constructed ideas. By tracing their origins, we can begin to see them not as necessary conditions for art and ethics, but as one important tradition among others, a tradition whose influence we cannot choose to follow or reject unless we understand where it comes from.

Before we can assess the logic of our own moral instincts, we must first become historians of them. Our investigation begins with the foundational Romantic assumption: the belief that a work of art is a direct and authentic manifestation of its creator's soul.

The entire logic of "moral contamination" rests on a single (very resonant) idea: that an artwork is a direct conduit to its creator's inner self. This wasn't always the dominant view. For centuries, art was largely seen as a craft, a skillful imitation of external reality or an expression of universal truths. The Romantic movement performed a radical reversal, relocating the source of art from the outside world to the artist's own soul. This was more than a change in taste; it was a profound philosophical project.

The key to this shift is the German concept of [*Gefühl*](/romantic-kit-glossary). As I've started to explore in my project of [reconsidering the Romantics](/post-53), this term means far more than "feeling." It was a strategic philosophical concept, elevated by thinkers like Schleiermacher to designate a fundamental, pre-reflective mode of awareness. *Gefühl* is not an emotion about a thing; it is the immediate, holistic consciousness of being itself. It was positioned as the ground from which all authentic thought, piety, and, crucially, artistic creation emerge.

This revaluation of feeling provided the philosophical license for a new theory of art: expressivism. The highest purpose of art was no longer to imitate nature, but to give form to this deep, singular, and authentic inner state. The artwork became the sensible evidence of the artist's soul. As I argued in my reading of Whitman's ["Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,"](/post-25) the author becomes a presence who "pours his meaning into you." This ideal of [authenticity](/romantic-kit-authenticity), the perfect, uncorrupted link between the inner vision and the outer work, became the new measure of artistic greatness.

This moral and intellectual perspective was not a discovery of a timeless truth about art; it was a intellectual process emerging from opposition to Enlightenment rationalism. By sacralizing the artist's inner life, the Romantics created a new vocabulary for talking about art's value. When we instinctively feel that a work by an unethical creator is "tainted," we are speaking this language. We are assuming that the art is a direct relic of a flawed inner self, a manifestation of a corrupt *Gefühl*. This connection, first growing out into view two centuries ago, remains the primary justification for our modern impulse to turn away.

If an artist's inner state (*Gefühl*) is the true source of art, how does it become an actual poem, painting, or film? The Romantics needed a model of creation that could preserve the sacred link between the creator's soul and the finished work. They found it in nature. Their answer was the theory of [organic form](/romantic-kit-organic-form), a counter-metaphor to the soulless logic of [the machine](/romantic-kit-technology-machine).

The theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher provided one of the most rigorous concepts for this process: the [*Keimentschluß*](/romantic-kit-glossary), or "seminal decision." This is not a mere plan or outline. It is the originating, unifying impulse of a work, the catalytic moment where the artist's foundational *Gefühl* fuses with a specific, guiding intention. It is the "seed" from which the entire work is destined to grow.

This model recasts the entire creative act. An artist is not a builder assembling pre-fabricated parts according to an external blueprint. An artist is more like a gardener cultivating a unique form of life. The artwork is not constructed; it unfolds organically from its generative seed. Every word, every brushstroke of the work is intrinsically connected to the whole because it is a necessary expression of that singular, originating impulse. Authenticity from this point of view is a measure of the unbroken connection between the seed and the fruit.

This polemical opposition between the organic and the mechanical was a core part of the Romantic project. We see it in our own time when we demand that a pastor's sermon be the product of a sincere, personal struggle, as I discussed in [Post 26](/post-26). We expect it to be the organic unfolding of their wrestling with the text, not a mechanical assembly of theological talking points.

The concept of the *Keimentschluß* gives this instinct a philosophical backbone. And it provides the crucial logic for the idea of aesthetic contamination. If a work of art is the living incarnation of its creator's seminal decision, then an artist in a state of moral corruption (hate or abuse) cannot produce a pure work. The originating impulse, the *Keimentschluß*, is poisoned. The artwork that unfolds from this tainted seed will necessarily be a vector for that same spiritual malaise. To engage with it, and especially to financially support it, is to become complicit. It is to water a poisoned seed.

Once you locate the ultimate source of meaning and morality within the [individual's authentic soul](/post-74), a profound shift occurs. The entire external world (society, its institutions, even other people) is recast. It is no longer a neutral space for action, but a potential source of corruption, a threat to the integrity of the self. This deep-seated anxiety about moral contamination is not a timeless feature of the human condition; it is a specific, historical consequence of the Romantic turn inward.

This new ethical system created a fundamental antagonism between the individual and the collective. For the Romantics, conformity became the cardinal sin. Society was seen as an inimical force that imposes false roles and violates the sanctity of the true, inner self. A strong expression of this was the critique of the city and the machine. As I've explored when thinking about [the machine as a metaphor](/romantic-kit-technology-machine), Romantics like William Blake saw the industrial city as a landscape of spiritual decay. His vision of "dark Satanic Mills" in the preface to *Milton*, which I referenced in [a previous post](/post-53), was not just a social critique; it was a theological one. The factories were a physical manifestation of a mechanistic worldview that was actively destroying the "Divine Humanity."

This anxiety extended beyond the city into the realm of personal relationships. If the highest duty is to be true to oneself, then any relationship that demands compromise poses a direct threat to one's moral purity. Entanglement with an unethical person is not just unpleasant; it is a source of potential contamination. It forces a choice between one's relational bonds and one's own moral standards.

In response to this perceived threat, the Romantic imagination required an ethics of principled withdrawal. The solitary figure, the isolated artist, the defiant hero, the prophet in the wilderness was elevated into an ethical ideal. The artist's isolation was not a social failure but a necessary act of self-preservation. This is the core logic behind the impulse to boycott. It is an act of withdrawal, an attempt to protect one's own moral purity from a contaminating association. It is a modern expression of an ethics that sees the world not as a home, but as a threat.

title: "Schiller's Ideal of the \"Beautiful Soul\""
post_number: 77
date: 2024-03-18

If the world is a source of moral threat, what is the ideal state to be defended? The German poet and philosopher Friedrich Schiller provided the most influential answer with his concept of the [*schöne Seele*](/romantic-kit-glossary), or "beautiful soul." This was not just a passing phrase; it was a sophisticated aesthetic solution to a deep philosophical problem inherited from Immanuel Kant: the seemingly endless civil war between our reason and our desires.

For Kant, a moral act was one performed from duty alone, untainted by personal inclination. Schiller found this vision of a grim, joyless virtue to be incomplete. He proposed a higher ideal: a state of perfect inner harmony where one's duties and inclinations are seamlessly aligned. In the beautiful soul, the "ethical sense has...taken control of all a person's feelings." There is no longer a struggle between what you ought to do and what you want to do. Your inclinations have been so perfectly educated that you naturally desire the good. Moral action flows from this integrated character with an effortless grace (*Anmut*).

This ideal has profound psychological consequences. It reframes the experience of inner conflict. A struggle between your aesthetic pleasure (enjoying an artist's work) and your moral conviction (condemning the artist's actions) is no longer a sign of a functioning conscience. It is a symptom of a fragmented, uncultivated, and *not beautiful* soul. The presence of dissonance is itself a mark of moral failure.

The modern boycott can be understood as an attempt to resolve this painful dissonance and restore the feeling of inner harmony that Schiller idealized. The boycotter refuses to live in a state of internal contradiction. By refusing to consume the "tainted" art, they forcefully align their actions with their moral beliefs, silencing the conflict. This act of abstention is a defensive maneuver, an attempt to achieve, in the marketplace, the state of unconflicted purity that the beautiful soul represents.

The Romantic way of understanding and expressing reality did more than just redefine the author and their moral duties; it redefined the act of reading. If an artwork is the [organic unfolding](/post-75) of a singular soul, then to truly understand it requires more than just analyzing its grammar and structure. It requires an act of communion.

This is the core of [Romantic Hermeneutics](/romantic-kit-hermeneutics), the interpretive method developed by thinkers like Schleiermacher. He argued that understanding is not our default state; misunderstanding is the norm. To overcome this, an interpreter must move beyond the "grammatical" side of a text (its public language and form) and engage with its "psychological" side. As I've touched on in ["The Search for the Divine Spark,"](/post-57) this psychological rail is not about amateur psychoanalysis; it is a disciplined attempt to reconstruct the unique, creative vision that gave the work its shape.

The ultimate goal of this method is a "divinatory leap," a sympathetic, intuitive act of understanding where the reader imaginatively merges their consciousness with the reconstructed consciousness of the author. Successful interpretation becomes a form of psychological intimacy, a temporary fusion of two souls. As Walt Whitman perfectly enacted in ["Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,"](/post-25) the reader is invited into a direct, personal encounter with the author's living presence.

This redefinition of reading as communion is what makes engagement with an unethical artist so perilous. If the act of watching a film or reading a book is understood as an invitation to psychically inhabit its creator's perspective, who would willingly choose to "merge" their consciousness with that of a known abuser or bigot? The experience becomes an act of intimacy with a contaminated source. The refusal to watch or listen is a refusal of this communion, a slamming of the door on the "divinatory leap" into a consciousness now known to be toxic.

This entire interpretive model (this technology for reading) was invented to access the newly sacred inner life of the author. It is an important tool, but its own logic dictates that when the source is perceived as corrupt, the only safe and moral act is to refuse the connection entirely.

Let's consider the possibility that this entire description of an intellectual lineage, from Schleiermacher's hermeneutics to Schiller's beautiful soul, is an elegant but ultimately irrelevant historical detour. Here's the counter-narrative. It's an objection positing that the modern boycott has little to do with an unacknowledged [Romantic inheritance](/post-73) and is instead a product of distinctly modern, secular, and materialist concerns.

From this perspective, analyzing the boycott for traces of *Gefühl* is just over-reading. The modern consumer is not a frustrated Romantic wrestling with their soul's purity. They are a pragmatic actor operating in a complex global marketplace. This counter-narrative rests on three pillars:

1. **Conscious Consumerism:** The most direct explanation is economic. People boycott because they do not want their money to financially support individuals or corporations whose actions they find reprehensible. This isn't an ethics of inner purity; it's an ethics of material impact. It's the same logic that drives boycotts of companies that use sweatshop labor or damage the environment. It is a practical, consequentialist action rooted in a clear understanding of economic complicity.

2. **Social Signaling and Solidarity:** The act of boycotting is rarely a private one; it is a public and social statement. Its power lies in collective action and social signaling. Refusing to engage with an artist's work is an act of solidarity with victims and a method of stripping "cultural capital" from the unethical creator. This is a sociological act, not a spiritual one, aimed at influencing public norms and participating in a wider social justice conversation.

3. **Media Literacy:** The modern, media-literate audience is keenly aware that art is a product. They understand the immense collaborative and industrial machinery behind a blockbuster film or a pop album. The idea that they are engaging in a mystical [communion with the creator's soul](/post-78) is, for this audience, a naive fiction.

This pragmatic view represents a competing intellectual tradition, one with its own historical roots in Enlightenment consequentialism and 20th-century sociology. It sees the world in terms of systems, power, and economic flows. It's basically the analysis I looked at earlier of [evil as systemic harm](/post-10). It argues that we should analyze the boycott on these terms, not by projecting the esoteric concerns of 19th-century German philosophers onto the modern public.

The core of the [pragmatic objection](/post-79) is its de-mythologized view of the author. The Romantic ideal of the solitary genius pouring their soul onto the page has been replaced by a more cynical, or perhaps simply more realistic, understanding of art as an industrial product. Today's most contested art forms (films, pop music, TV series) are the output of a vast, collaborative, and commercial apparatus.

In this model, the director, actor, or musician at the center of a controversy is not the singular, spiritual source of the work in the way a Romantic would understand it. They are the public face of the enterprise, the primary financial beneficiary, and the focal point of the marketing. In short, they are the CEO of the brand. The boycott is not a refusal to commune with a contaminating soul; it is a targeted economic action against the brand's most visible asset.

This perspective aligns perfectly with Michel Foucault's later, systematic analysis of the ["author-function."](/ai-kit-author-function) Foucault argued that the "author" is not a real person but a social construct, a principle of coherence we use to classify and control discourse. The pragmatic boycotter operates on this principle. They are not concerned with the artist's authentic *Gefühl* but with their functional role as a figure of authority and economic power.

From a genealogical perspective, this view represents the historical triumph of the worldview the Romantics defined themselves against. The "Mechanical Age" that Thomas Carlyle diagnosed in his critique of [industrial logic](/romantic-kit-technology-machine) has, in this view, completely subsumed the world of art. The pragmatist does not mourn this shift; they accept it as reality and adapt their ethical strategies accordingly. They operate within the logic of the machine because they believe there is no other logic left. Their actions are a direct acknowledgment that the Romantics' battle to preserve a sacred, organic model of creation has been lost.

The pragmatic objection, outlined in the [last post](/post-80), is a really important challenge. And it's probably got a lot of truth to it. It argues that modern audiences have a de-mythologized view of art as an industrial product, and that boycotts are simply targeted economic actions against a brand. While it is true that art is produced collaboratively and operates within a market, this view fails to think in a careful way about the logic of our engagement with it. Even in a mechanical age, we seem unable to shake the hunt for a singular, unifying vision.

This is where the Romantic concept of the [*Keimentschluß*, or "seminal decision,"](/post-75) reasserts its power. We may know that a film is the product of a thousand technicians, but we still speak of "a Christopher Nolan film." We attribute the success or failure of a television series to its "showrunner." The logic of our criticism and consumption still attempts an organizing principle, a singular consciousness from which the work's unifying vision unfolds. We still search, in other words, for *the* origin.

The Romantic insists that this is not just a convenient shorthand. It is a recognition that a successful work of art feels [organic](/romantic-kit-organic-form), not like a "mechanical assembly of discrete, interchangeable parts." When we boycott a film because of its director, we are not just targeting a CEO; we are rejecting the work's principle of life, its generative soul.

This organic model is precisely what makes the idea of "economic contamination" so coherent and potent. If the artwork were merely an industrial product, then purchasing it would be a morally neutral transaction. But if it is the living incarnation of its creator's *Keimentschluß*, then the economic act becomes one of profound moral significance. To pay for the art is to "water the poisoned seed." The money is transformed into the lifeblood that sustains a particular spiritual orientation in the world. The complicity is not merely economic; it is spiritual, a direct nourishing of a corrupt generative source. The pragmatic objection fails because it underestimates the enduring power of the organic model of authorship it claims we have outgrown.

A central tenet of the pragmatic critique is the "small agent problem": one person's refusal to stream a song or buy a ticket has no meaningful economic impact. So why does the act feel so morally urgent? The pragmatic view, focused on consequences, struggles to explain this intensity. The Romantic ethical point of view, however, accounts for it perfectly.

This requires tracing an important intellectual lineage. The Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant envisioned a universal "Kingdom of Ends," a moral commonwealth united by shared, rational laws. The Romantics inherited Kant's deontological structure (his focus on duty over consequences) but radically transformed its content. Thinkers like Fichte and Schlegel shifted the locus of moral duty inward. The supreme command was no longer to act on a universal law, but to be true to one's own unique, [authentic self](/romantic-kit-authenticity).

This move shattered the universal moral community into a "Kingdom of Individuals." The highest duty is not to fix the corrupt world, but to ensure one's own moral separateness from it. The boycott, then, is not primarily a tool for collective change but an expressive act of self-legislation. Its value is deontological, residing in the act itself (the preservation of one's moral integrity) regardless of the outcome.

The boycott becomes a "moral semaphore." Its purpose is not economic coercion but symbolic expression. It is a public affirmation of one's values and a refusal to be complicit in what one deems wrong. In a world where total moral purity seems impossible, the expressive boycott is a declaration that "effort still counts." It is an act of fidelity to the self, a profound echo of the Romantic imperative to prioritize the integrity of one's own soul above all else. This explains why the practical inefficacy of the act does not diminish its perceived moral necessity.

title: "The Pathology of Inaction: Hegel's Diagnosis"
post_number: 83
date: 2024-03-24

Just as the Romantic ideal of the isolated, morally pure self reached its zenith, it met its most serious, rigorous critic. The philosopher G.W.F. Hegel, in his 1807 masterpiece *Phenomenology of Spirit*, developed a rigorous and harsh diagnosis of this entire ethical posture. He gave its embodiment a name: the "beautiful soul" (*schöne Seele*), a direct reference to the Schillerian ideal I discussed in [a previous post](/post-77).

Hegel's beautiful soul is a consciousness fanatically devoted to its own internal purity. It perceives the actual world of politics, commerce, and social life as inherently corrupt and messy. To preserve the "splendour of its inner being," it must avoid engagement at all costs. Any concrete action, any deed, is seen as a potential contamination that would stain its pristine conscience. This existential dread compels the beautiful soul to "flee from contact with the actual world."

This is the crux of Hegel's critique. This retreat is an abdication of morality itself. For Hegel, ethical life is not a matter of private feeling or pure intention; it is realized only through concrete action in a shared world. The beautiful soul's purity is the purity of nothingness, an empty abstraction that has no purchase on reality. It substitutes an aesthetic solution (the feeling of being inwardly right) for a real, ethical one.

From this critical perspective, the modern, purity-based boycott can be analyzed as a contemporary iteration of this "pathology of inaction." The focus on principled withdrawal and the preservation of a "clean conscience" directly mirrors the beautiful soul's flight from the actual. It risks substituting the subjective feeling of being moral, achieved through non-consumption, for the difficult, messy, and inevitably compromising work of acting morally within the systems it condemns. The retreat into inaction, Hegel warns, is not a higher form of morality, but its negation.

The beautiful soul, as diagnosed by Hegel, does not remain in silent, passive retreat. Its need for self-certainty drives it to become active in a specific, pathological way: it becomes a "judging conscience." From its perch of self-imposed inaction, it passes severe judgment on those who dare to act in the messy, compromised world.

Hegel stages this as a dialectical conflict. On one side is the "judging conscience" (the beautiful soul, secure in its abstract purity). On the other is the "acting conscience" (the individual who must make choices, prioritize certain duties over others, and inevitably get their hands dirty). From the absolutist perspective of the beautiful soul, any concrete action will always appear impure, a betrayal of some universal principle. The judging soul sees only the stain on the actor's hands, remaining willfully blind to the fact that its own hands are empty.

This dynamic culminates in the beautiful soul's transformation into the "hard heart." When the acting conscience, in a moment of self-awareness, confesses its own imperfection and tries for recognition of its shared, fallible humanity, the beautiful soul refuses. To forgive, to acknowledge nuance or complicity, would be to compromise its own sense of righteousness. This refusal of recognition is the beautiful soul's ultimate moral failure. In its zealous condemnation of the other's impurity, it reveals its own.

Hegel's 200-year-old analysis hits pretty hard at the public, performative nature of many modern boycotts. The online condemnation of individuals who fail to participate, the absolutist language of "cancel culture," and the reduction of complex issues to viral hashtags all mirror the dynamic of the judging conscience. Social media platforms can become a "digital pillory," enabling mass, instantaneous judgment. The goal ceases to be ethical transformation and becomes the performative maintenance of an in-group's purity through the punitive exclusion of the impure (a dynamic that gets pretty close to the "expert's anxiety" I discussed in [Post 69](/post-69)). This is the pathology of the hard heart operating on a societal scale.

Hegel's critique of the beautiful soul is so sharp that it can be mistaken for an endorsement simple pragmatism. If the flight into pure intention is an abdication of morality, it might seem that the only alternative is to judge actions by their tangible, real-world results. But it's wrong to conclude Hegel is a simple consequentialist. That misses the most important move in his philosophy.

An embrace of the economic or political objection to the boycott is just as one-sided and abstract as the beautiful soul's obsession with purity. The pragmatist who reduces ethics to a calculus of impact commits a mirror-image error. They focus solely on the external consequence, ignoring the entire subjective dimension of conviction and freedom that Hegel identifies as the great achievement of modern morality. Both the "pure" boycotter and the "realistic" pragmatist accept the fundamental split between the inner self and the outer world; they are arguing from opposite sides of a chasm.

Hegel's solution is not to choose a side but to heal the split itself. He attempts to overcome their one-sidedness. This is the move into what he calls *Sittlichkeit*, or "ethical life."

*Sittlichkeit* refers to the established ethical order of a community, the living substance of its customs, traditions, and social institutions. For Hegel, true freedom isn't realized in the heroic isolation of the individual conscience or in the unreflective action of the pragmatist but through meaningful participation in a shared, rational community. A Hegelian response tries to transform the institutions that create the ethical problem in the first place. It requires moving beyond the individualistic act of consumption toward the collective, political act of citizenship, which is one of the potential ["Three Roads Forward."](/post-63) This is the difficult but necessary work of building a society where ethical life is not a matter of private retreat but of shared, concrete reality.

This series has traced a long and complex intellectual lineage, from the Romantics' creation of a new ethics of authenticity to Hegel's critique of its internal contradictions. We arrive now at a synthesis, not of a final answer, but of a clearer understanding of our present condition. The modern debate over boycotts is the stage where two competing historical frameworks for ethical life collide.

The series began by reconstructing the [Romantic inheritance](/post-73): an ethical and aesthetic worldview based on the sacredness of the individual soul. We saw how this produced a demand for [artistic authenticity](/post-74), an ethics of [purity and withdrawal](/post-76), and a model of reading as [intimate communion](/post-78). All of this, I argued, provides the deep (and mostly unconscious) logic for the modern boycotter's profound sense of moral urgency and personal contamination.

Next I looked at the counter-narrative, which dismisses this history in favor of a secular analysis of [economics and social signaling](/post-79). Then this counter-narrative was (again) challenged by a Romantic model I just don't think has ever quit. The Romantic reasserts itself in the logic of the ["poisoned seed"](/post-81) and the defiance of the ["moral semaphore."](/post-82)

Hegel's critique shows the instability at the heart of the Romantic project. His diagnosis of the ["beautiful soul"](/post-83) as a consciousness engaged in a "pathology of inaction," which devolves into the hypocrisy of the ["hard heart,"](/post-84) makes for a very damaging analysis of an ethics based on pure interiority. Hege's proposed perspective is a turn to the shared, concrete world of [*Sittlichkeit*](/post-85) or the "ethical life."

This leaves us with tension. We are heirs to both traditions. The Schillerian desire for a "clean conscience" and a life of inner harmony is still a normal human aspiration. It's the engine of our personal moral convictions. But the Hegelian demand for engagement in an ambiguous and shared world is a requirement for any meaningful social or political life. The modern boycott is the expression of this conflict. It is an attempt to achieve Schillerian purity within a Hegelian world of complex interdependence.

As I sketched out in ["Three Roads Forward,"](/post-63) this dilemma forces a choice. The path of the beautiful soul leads toward a deep opt-out. The pragmatic view encourages us to skate along the surface. The Hegelian analysis tries to find a deep opt-in.

The analytical thesis of this blog so far has been that the influence of Romantic ideas is much more pervasive than we typically acknowledge. By labeling "Romanticism" a historical period that ended in the 19th century, we blind ourselves to the ways in which its core assumptions continue to animate many of our contemporary debates. The modern boycott is an instructive example. The reason the conversation is often so intractable is that we are treating historically contingent ideas about art, ethics, and the self as if they are universal truths.

The genealogical goal of this series was to make that intellectual lineage visible. The point was not to declare a "winner" between the Romantics and their critics but to bring out some old sources of what feel like our moral instincts. When we demand [authenticity](/romantic-kit-authenticity) from an artist, we're not appealing to a timeless virtue; we're re-enacting a specific revaluation of the self that was a project of the Romantic movement.

This entire intellectual architecture (the elevation of *Gefühl*, the ideal of the *schöne Seele*, the hermeneutics of communion) was a coherent response to the challenges of its time. But it is an inheritance, not an inevitability. Hegel's critique demonstrated that this framework contained the seeds of its own pathology. The quest for absolute purity could collapse into judgmental inaction.

It's also probably the case that more of these Romantic traces are out there. This seems like the thing I need to keep doing, looking for them and thinking about them.

I'm pretty sure my [Deleuze project](/post-72) will uncover a bunch more.

Just a quick thought on the ["deep opt-in"](/post-63) framework. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's essay ["We Should All Be Feminists"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Should_All_Be_Feminists) is different kind of deep-opting-in.

Here's a quote:

> Culture does not make people. People make culture.

This is the entire philosophy of the deep opt-in in a single sentence. It is a declaration of human agency and a rejection of the idea that the systems we live in are external, alien forces. If we make the culture, then we have both the power and the responsibility to remake it. It is an argument against withdrawal and against passive acceptance.

Her title makes this a *collective* imperative. "We Should *All* Be Feminists" is not a personal choice; it's a call for everyone to participate in the work. It is the opposite of the ["deep opt-out"](/post-63) that seeks purity in withdrawal. It is a command to stay and do the work.

More to come.

This blog has spent a lot of time exploring the tension between what I've called the ["deep opt-out"](/post-63) and the ["deep opt-in"](/post-63). Two answers to the question of how we orient ourselves to the world. In my [posts about the boycott stuff](/post-73), I framed the opt-out as being rooted in a [Romantic trace](/post-21), a desire to protect an authentic soul from a corrupting world. But this doesn't capture the whole picture. The choice to opt out can also be grounded in a more principled defense of individual freedom. To build this stronger case, I'm turning to [David Oderberg's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_S._Oderberg) book, *Opting Out: Conscience and cooperation in a pluralistic society*.

Oderberg's work provides a philosophical toolkit for understanding why the right to withdraw is not an antisocial act but a necessary foundation for a free society. Here are three of his core arguments.

### 1. The Right Against Compulsion

At its heart, the argument for opting out is an argument against coercion. Oderberg establishes this as the absolute baseline for a liberal society. Freedom of conscience is not a preference to be accommodated when convenient; it is a fundamental right that becomes meaningless the moment the state can compel a person to violate it through force or severe penalty.

> If freedom of religion and conscience mean anything in a liberal society, it must mean the right at least to live out one's core beliefs in a way that does not involve compulsion to violate them, whether it be the threat of force, the imposition of significant material burdens, and the like. (p. 16)

This is the bedrock principle. Oderberg is arguing that a society that pays lip service to freedom while imposing "significant material burdens" (like crippling fines or the loss of one's livelihood) on those who exercise it is not free at all. The act of opting out, in this view, is a defensive measure against a state that is overstepping its legitimate bounds. It is a necessary check on power.

### 2. The Freedom of Dissociation

Oderberg extends this principle from the individual's relationship with the state to their relationship with other citizens, especially in the marketplace. He argues that the universally recognized "freedom of association" has a necessary and equal corollary: the "freedom of dissociation." This radically reframes the debate over bakers, florists, and guest house owners.

> [F]reedom of religion and conscience in a liberal society can be looked at as a manifestation or aspect of the fundamental freedom of dissociation... a person... who objects in conscience to being involved or implicated in a certain activity, or practice, or service, is in effect saying that they don't want to be associated with it or the people who are trying to involve the objector in it. (p. 96)

This is the most challenging part of his argument. It recasts the conflict from one of "discrimination" to one of "forced association." If you have the right to choose your friends, your club, or your political party, Oderberg asks, why do you not have the right to choose whom you enter into a contract with? To compel a baker to participate in a ceremony that violates their conscience is, in this view, to violate their fundamental right *not* to associate. It forces them to become a participant in an event they reject, transforming a commercial transaction into an act of compelled speech and association.

### 3. The Ethics of Cooperation and Complicity

Finally, Oderberg offers a nuanced way to think about moral responsibility. The right to opt out isn't just about refusing to perform the final, objectionable act. It's about the right to refuse to be a cog in the machine that leads to it. He uses the case of two Scottish midwives who were conscientiously opposed to abortion to make this point.

> It was not *mere participation* to which the midwives objected, but other activities ancillary to the procedure itself that they held to *assist or facilitate* the provision of abortions. Such assistance or facilitation was, for them as for most conscientious objectors, deeply morally troublesome. (p. 52)

This is a crucial distinction. A conscience clause that only protects you from direct "participation" is almost meaningless if you can still be compelled to manage the abortion ward, schedule the appointments, and support the staff who perform the procedure. For the objector, this is a distinction without a difference. Being forced to facilitate an act you believe to be gravely wrong makes you morally complicit. A meaningful right to opt out must therefore include the right to refuse not just the act itself, but any ancillary work that directly enables it. Without this, the right is a hollow promise.

Taken together, these three arguments constitute a philosophically grounded defense of the deep opt-out. It is a position based not on sentiment but on a robust conception of liberty in which the right to say "no" is the ultimate safeguard of a free and pluralistic society.

In the [last post](/post-89), I laid out a principled defense of the "deep opt-out," drawing on David Oderberg's arguments for freedom of conscience and dissociation. Oderberg makes the case for the right of individuals and groups to withdraw from activities that violate their core beliefs. But there is a counter-argument. It insists on a kind of "deep opt-in" to the shared life of a pluralistic society. This view argues that some exposure to difference is not just permissible, but necessary for citizenship itself.

The stakes of this conflict are incredibly high. As Nomi Maya Stolzenberg has shown in her work on the famous [*Mozert v. Hawkins*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozert_v._Hawkins) case, for insular religious communities, the "mere exposure" to diverse viewpoints in public schools is not a neutral act of education. It is perceived as a form of assimilation and indoctrination, a direct threat to their cultural survival. This is why the debate isn't just about hurt feelings; it's about a fundamental clash between two different views of what a society owes its citizens and what its citizens owe in return.

Stephen Macedo, in his essay "Liberal Civic Education and Religious Fundamentalism," makes the case for the "deep opt-in" with direct force. He argues that in a liberal democracy, the right to opt out has its limits, especially when the education of future citizens is at stake.

> As a matter of basic principle at least, we have good reason to refuse the *Mozert* families' request to opt out. If intransigence here appears to be at odds with religious freedom, it must be remembered that rightful liberty is civil liberty, or liberty that can be guaranteed equally to all. All of us must accept limits on our liberty designed to sustain a system of equal liberty for all. Each of us can reasonably be asked to surrender some control over our own children for the sake of reasonable common efforts to insure that all future citizens learn the minimal prerequisites of citizenship. There is no right to be exempted from measures reasonably designed to help secure the freedom of all.

This is the core of the "deep opt-in" argument. Macedo is asserting that membership in a free society comes with a price. That price is the acceptance of "reasonable common efforts" to teach the "minimal prerequisites of citizenship," chief among them being tolerance for diversity. From this perspective, allowing a group to completely shield its children from different ways of life is not a protection of their liberty, but a threat to the liberty of all. It undermines the conditions that make a pluralistic society possible. For Macedo, the freedom of the individual conscience cannot be used as a veto against the shared project of creating citizens.

The [last post](/post-90) introduced Stephen Macedo's argument for a civic "deep opt-in," a stance that justifies certain compulsory aspects of public education as necessary for creating citizens. This argument hinges on cases like [*Mozert v. Hawkins County Board of Education*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozert_v._Hawkins), where fundamentalist Christian families sought to opt their children out of a reading program they found objectionable. To understand the depth of this conflict, we need to move past a surface-level reading of the case. The scholar Nomi Maya Stolzenberg, in her groundbreaking article, "'He Drew a Circle That Shut Me Out': Assimilation, Indoctrination, and the Paradox of a Liberal Education," argues that the fundamentalist complaint is far more than a simple objection to offensive content; it is a coherent critique of the core assumptions of liberal society.

The facts of *Mozert* seem straightforward: in 1983, families in Tennessee argued that the Holt Basic reading series violated their free exercise of religion by exposing their children to ideas contrary to their beliefs, such as evolution, feminism, and religious relativism. The liberal defense, and the ultimate position of the courts, was that "mere exposure" to diverse ideas is not a constitutional harm. Because the school was not compelling the students to believe anything, it was seen as a neutral act that left the students free to choose their own values.

Stolzenberg's insight is that this defense misses the entire point of the fundamentalist objection. For the parents in *Mozert*, the harm was not that their children were being forced to recite a creed they rejected. The harm was the "objective" method itself.

> The fundamentalists' assault goes far beyond their now-familiar resistance to evolutionary theory and sex education. In several recent suits, they have asserted that the teaching of diverse viewpoints in a tolerant and objective mode threatens the survival of their culture.

This is the paradox. The school's "tolerant and objective mode" of teaching (presenting different religions, cultures, and values as interesting options in a marketplace of ideas) is the actual mechanism of assimilation. It takes the fundamentalists' understanding of their faith as objective, revealed Truth and reframes it as one subjective "belief system" among many. It forces the child to adopt a critical, detached posture toward their own inherited worldview. In Stolzenberg's analysis, this is not neutrality; it is active indoctrination into the specific culture of liberal, secular humanism. The freedom to choose one's own lifestyle is precisely the "injurious violation" the fundamentalists were trying to prevent.

What makes Stolzenberg's argument really intriguing is her demonstration that this critique of liberalism's false neutrality is not unique to the religious right. In fact, it shares a deep structural similarity with arguments from the academic left.

> In a similar vein, some feminists have assailed gender-neutrality and argued that basic liberal institutions are egalitarian in ways that reflect distinctively male values... The new "critical race theory"... criticizes the hegemonic function of seemingly neutral principles...

Stolzenberg points out that when critical race theorists argue that a "color-blind" legal system is not neutral but actually enforces white, hegemonic norms, they are making the same kind of argument as the *Mozert* plaintiffs. The same is true for feminist critiques of supposedly neutral principles that are, in fact, based on male experience. In both cases, the core claim is that a system pretending to be universal and objective is actually imposing the values of the dominant culture and assimilating those outside of it.

This creates an uncomfortable and unacknowledged alliance. The academic left would never see itself as an ally of Christian fundamentalists, yet both groups are engaged in a similar project: unmasking the hidden, coercive power of a liberal order that claims to be neutral. Stolzenberg's work forces us to take the fundamentalist opt-out seriously, not as an act of religious intolerance but as a coherent critique of the invisible architecture of typical liberal societies.

title: "Skating Along the Surface: A Pyrrhonist Guide"
post_number: 92
date: 2024-04-02

After exploring the commitments of the deep opt-in and the deep opt-out, it's time to work out a defense of the [third path](/post-63): skating along the surface. To do this, we can look at an ancient Greek tradition that perfected it. Pyrrhonism is not a set of doctrines to be learned, but an *agōgē*, a way of life, a disposition, and a practice. Its purpose is not to find the truth but to cure the mental distress that comes from believing you must.

The key figure is Pyrrho of Elis (c. 365-275 BCE), but since he wrote nothing, our understanding comes from later followers, most importantly Sextus Empiricus. For them, the philosopher is a "zetetic," or seeker, who is defined by their commitment to "continuing to investigate."

The Pyrrhonist practice is a repeatable psychological process:

- It begins when "men of talent," perturbed by contradictions in the world, set out to find what is true and what is false, hoping to find peace of mind.
- In their investigation, they discover *isosthenia*, or equipollence: for any claim about the true nature of things, an opposing argument of equal persuasive force can be found.
- Faced with this intellectual deadlock, the honest response is *epoché*, the suspension of judgment. You neither affirm nor deny the claim.
- Finally, a profound state of *ataraxia*, or tranquility, follows the suspension of judgment "as a shadow follows a body". Peace of mind arrives as an unexpected byproduct of giving up the search for it in dogmatic belief.

This might work as a basis for the skater's mindset. The AI debate, with its utopian versus dystopian conclusions, is a perfect case of *isosthenia*. The skater's refusal to get pulled into the hype is a modern practice of *epoché*. The goal of "waiting for the fever to break" is a search for *ataraxia*. But this raises the objection brought against skeptics for millennia: is such a life actually livable? If you suspend belief, won't you be paralyzed and unable to act?

In the [last post](/post-92), I framed the "skating along the surface" mindset as a modern form of Pyrrhonism. This immediately leads to an objection to the skeptical way of life: the charge of *apraxia* or the impossibility of action. Critics have argued for thousands of years that a life without belief is unlivable. Ancient anecdotes, likely hostile inventions, claimed Pyrrho would ignore oncoming wagons and precipices, needing his friends to keep him safe. If a skeptic truly suspends judgment on whether bread is more nourishing than a stone, how can they survive?

The Pyrrhonist response is sophisticated and reveals the practical core of their philosophy. It rests on a crucial distinction between dogmatic beliefs and appearances. The target of suspension of judgment (*epoché*) is specifically *doxa*: beliefs about non-evident matters or claims about the hidden, true nature of reality. A Pyrrhonist does not suspend judgment on *phainomena*, the appearances, or how things seem to them right now. As Sextus Empiricus explains, a skeptic grants that honey *appears* sweet but suspends judgment on whether it is sweet *in its essence*.

Based on this distinction, Sextus outlines a "fourfold rule of life" that allows the skeptic to navigate the world undogmatically (*adoxastos*) and avoid paralysis. The skater, as a modern Pyrrhonist, has a full toolkit for action:

1. **Guidance of Nature:** They are guided by their natural capacities for sensation and thought. An AI tool that appears to streamline a task is used; one that appears to complicate it is set aside.

2. **Constraint of Passions:** They are compelled by involuntary states like hunger and thirst. This extends to creative impulses. The desire to write or create is a pathos that drives them to seek the necessary tools without needing a dogmatic belief about the ultimate value of their project.

3. **Tradition of Laws and Customs:** The skeptic observes the established rules of their community. A skater can adhere to ethical guidelines and regulations concerning AI, not because they are believed to be objectively true, but because they are the apparent consensus on how to manage the technology.

4. **Instruction of the Arts:** A skeptic can learn and practice a trade (*techné*) by following its established rules. A developer can use an AI coding assistant according to current best practices, observing its results without holding a firm belief about whether AI will ultimately enhance or destroy their profession.

This framework refutes the charge of apraxia. The skater isn't paralyzed. They are guided by a set of non-dogmatic criteria: natural perception, internal drives, social convention, and practical training. This allows them to engage with AI practically while maintaining *epoché* on the irresolvable, dogmatic questions that cause so much anxiety. Skating the surface isn't a cowardly retreat. It is a therapeutic practice for living rationally and peacefully in a world where the future will always be hidden (because it's the future).

title: "The New Man Who \"Prefers Not To\" (Deleuze's Bartleby)"
post_number: 94
date: 2024-04-04
---

We begin with a story. A quiet, diligent law-copyist on Wall Street named Bartleby one day responds to a simple request from his boss with a simple phrase: "I would prefer not to." This refusal, repeated without explanation or emotion, expands until it consumes his work, his life, and the sanity of the office around him. He becomes a fixture, a ghost who has simply stopped participating. This figure of absolute refusal is the prototype test case for the ["Three Roads Forward"](/post-63). Is his an act of principled withdrawal (the Deep Opt-Out)? Or is it something else?

The philosopher Gilles Deleuze sees Bartleby's act not as a retreat but as a creative gesture. For him, the key is not Bartleby's psychology but his language. "I would prefer not to" is what Deleuze calls an "agrammatical formula." It isn't a simple "no." A "no" would be a choice within the existing system. The formula, instead, attacks the system itself. It carves out a "zone of indiscernibility" where the logic of choosing (of preferring one thing over another) collapses. It's a linguistic virus that renders the lawyer's world of commands and reasons inoperable.

By deploying this formula, Bartleby systematically dismantles the "paternal function" of the lawyer, who tries to manage him with authority, then kindness, then charity. Bartleby accepts none of it. He becomes, in Deleuze's terms, the "man without references," a figure who cannot be defined by his past, his job, or his relationships. He has escaped the old world's logic. He is an "Original," a new kind of man who functions as a pure potentiality, a blank slate.

This is why Deleuze's reading points toward a radical form of the "Deep Opt-In." Bartleby's act is not an escape from society but a necessary clearing of the ground for a new one. By erasing the old hierarchies, he makes possible a "society of brothers," a community built not on authority and filiation but on an alliance of singular, unclassifiable individuals. His refusal is not the end of the story, but the invention of a new way to begin it.

post_number: 95
date: 2024-04-05
---

In the [last post](/post-94), we saw Gilles Deleuze's Bartleby as a creative force, a "new man" whose strange formula opens the door to a new kind of community. The philosopher Slavoj Žižek looks at the same quiet scrivener and sees something very different. While both agree that Bartleby is a radical figure who breaks the system, Žižek is less interested in the new world Bartleby creates and more interested in the old one he violently destroys.

Žižek's analysis (I'm drawing on [this](https://thedangerousmaybe.medium.com/i-would-prefer-not-to-%C5%BEi%C5%BEeks-bartleby-politics-12bd8d9de66a) for my summary) begins with a critique of what he calls "pseudo-activity." Most forms of protest (marches, petitions, online outrage) are, for him, a kind of Foucault-style "resistance" that the system has already accounted for. These acts make us feel like we're doing something, but they ultimately reinforce the power structure they claim to oppose. Bartleby's refusal is of a completely different order. He does not protest; he does not argue. He simply withdraws.

This is the core of Žižek's "politics of subtraction." Bartleby's power lies in his refusal to participate in the ideological game at all. A system of power runs on our libidinal investment in it; we get a certain "enjoyment" (*jouissance*) even from resisting it. Bartleby subtracts this enjoyment entirely. By refusing to play, by refusing even to get angry or to make demands, he reveals the fundamental emptiness of the game itself. He starves the system of the very psychic energy it needs to function.

Where Deleuze sees the affirmation of a "new man," Žižek sees the power of a pure, voided subject. The point is not to become someone new, but to become, politically, no one. Bartleby's act is a gesture of pure, violent negativity that creates the empty space where a true political "Act" might become possible. It is not about building a new world but about demonstrating the absolute deadlock of the current one. In this reading, Bartleby is not the hopeful figure of the "Deep Opt-In," but the terrifyingly consistent embodiment of the "Deep Opt-Out," a refusal so total that it clears the board completely.

post_number: 96
date: 2024-04-06

In the last two posts, we explored two readings of Melville's scrivener. Žižek's analysis of Bartleby as a figure of pure, negative subtraction seems to align most easily with the story's more obvious details. A man refuses the world, is imprisoned, and dies. It's a bleak story, and Žižek's reading honors that bleakness. Deleuze's interpretation, which I framed as a "Deep Opt-In," feels much harder to justify. How can this story of isolation and death be about the creation of a new, affirmative way of life? Yet Deleuze insists it is. The purpose of this post is to take on that harder task: to show how Deleuze's creative, world-building reading finds its grounding in the concrete details of Melville's text.

First, Deleuze points out that Bartleby's formula is "contagious". This isn't just a clever observation; it's a key piece of textual evidence for his argument. The lawyer himself notices, with alarm, that he and his other clerks have started to "involuntarily" use the word "prefer" on "all sorts of not exactly suitable occasions". Turkey asks the lawyer if he would "prefer that I should" withdraw, and Nippers asks if he would "prefer to have a certain paper copied on blue paper or white". For Deleuze, this is the beginning of the new community taking shape. Bartleby's formula acts as a linguistic virus, breaking down the old language of command and reason. It forces the other characters onto a new, shared, and uncertain linguistic ground. It is the creation of a "society of brothers" united not by law or reason, but by a shared, irrational formula.

Second, Deleuze argues that Bartleby's presence "abolishes any paternal function". The story shows this happening in real time. The lawyer begins as the perfect benevolent father, a man of "prudence" and "method" who feels a charitable duty to his strange employee. But Bartleby's calm refusal completely "disarmed" and "unmanned" him, leaving him "bewildered, stunned, thunderstruck". The lawyer's paternal authority collapses. He is forced into a "zone of indetermination or indiscernibility" where the roles of boss and clerk, master and dependant, become blurred. He flees his own office while Bartleby remains immobile, becoming a "double" to the scrivener. This is the concrete "dissolution of the paternal function" that Deleuze argues is necessary before a new, non-hierarchical community can emerge.

Finally, there is the matter of Bartleby as the "man without references". When the lawyer asks Bartleby directly about his past (where he was born, anything about himself) the response is always the same: "I would prefer not to". The narrator himself states that "no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man". For Deleuze, this is not a sign of emptiness but of pure potentiality. Lacking a past, Bartleby is free. He is the "Original Man" Deleuze identifies with the American project: a "son of all nations" who is "without father or mother". His refusal to be defined by a personal history is what makes him a figure of the future. He is not opting out of life; he is opting in to a new form of it, one based not on who you were, but on the community you might create.

This is a difficult reading, but it is grounded in the story itself. The contagious formula, the lawyer's psychic breakdown, and Bartleby's radical lack of a past are all textual facts. For Deleuze, these are not signs of a story about nihilism and despair. They are the concrete steps in a revolutionary program.

So. Would the deep opt-in of Hegel want to sit down for supper with the Deleuzian form?

In the [last post](/post-96), we explored Gilles Deleuze's reading of Bartleby as a creative figure whose refusal opens the door to a new kind of community. This was our first look at a sophisticated "deep opt-in," a way of engaging with the world that seeks to create something new rather than simply withdraw. But this isn't the only form an opt-in can take. The boycott series, particularly in [Post 83](/post-83), introduced G.W.F. Hegel's powerful critique of the "beautiful soul," the consciousness that retreats from the world to preserve its own purity. Hegel's alternative was a demanding form of engagement he called *Sittlichkeit*, or "ethical life." The purpose of this post is to use Frederick Beiser's commentary on Hegel to explore what this rigorous, and often misunderstood, version of a "deep opt-in" truly requires of us.

For Hegel, the central problem of modern life was "division" (*Entzweiung*), synthesis of the ancient ideal the split between our individual desires and our public duties, between the self and society. His solution was not to choose one over the other but to synthesize them. As Beiser explains, the common goal of Hegel's generation was to achieve a "synthesis of the ancient ideal of community with the modern ideal of freedom" (p. 42). *Sittlichkeit* is the name for this synthesis. It refers to the customs, laws, and institutions of a rational society. For Hegel, true freedom is not the Romantic ideal of escaping society to be true to your inner self; it is realized only through meaningful participation in the shared life of a community.

This leads directly to Hegel's concept of the state, which is not the oppressive machine many imagine it to be. It is what he calls an "organic state." Beiser clarifies that this ideal was a reaction against both "the 'machine state' of enlightened absolutism" and "the atomistic state of liberalism, which was held together by a contract between self-interested individuals" (p. 41). The organic state is one where the individual and the collective are interdependent parts of a living whole. It is the concrete, institutional form of *Sittlichkeit*. To opt-in, in the Hegelian sense, is to accept your role within this organism, to find your purpose and freedom through contributing to the rational life of the whole.

This requires a radical rethinking of freedom itself. Hegel rejects the idea that freedom means being able to do whatever you want, unconstrained by external forces. Instead, he argues for a form of compatibilism, the idea that freedom and necessity are not opposites. Beiser explains Hegel's position with stark clarity: "to say that the self is free does not mean that its acts are undetermined; my willing to do something does not exclude, but indeed implies, that I have been determined to will it" (p. 75). This is the price of the Hegelian deep opt-in. It demands that we abandon the fantasy of absolute, unconstrained choice and instead learn to recognize the rational necessity in the world and align our will with it. Freedom is not escaping the system; it is becoming a conscious, willing participant in its rational unfolding.

The [last post](/post-97) outlined Hegel's demanding vision of a "deep opt-in," a path that requires us to find our freedom through participation in the rational institutions of the state. Now we must return to the other form of opting-in this blog has explored, the one we found in Deleuze's reading of Bartleby in [Post 94](/post-94) and [Post 96](/post-96). Deleuze's Bartleby also represents a "deep opt-in," but it is an opting-in to a creative, nomadic life of escape, of becoming the "man without references" who makes possible a "society of brothers." While both Hegel and Deleuze reject the Romantic's principled withdrawal, their own programs for engagement are not allies. They are fundamentally irreconcilable, two enemy visions of the future.

The first point of conflict is the state. For Hegel, the rational state is the highest realization of human freedom, the concrete form of ethical life (Beiser, 2005). For Deleuze, the state is the ultimate apparatus of capture. It is the "paternal function" that Bartleby's formula is designed to dismantle. Deleuze argues that the goal is to "liberate man from the father function... by constituting a society of brothers as a new universality" (Deleuze, 1997). The Hegelian citizen finds their identity within the state; the Deleuzian nomad finds it by escaping the state's codifying logic.

This political opposition is rooted in a deeper philosophical one. Hegel's dialectic is a logic of reconciliation; it works to resolve contradictions into a higher, more comprehensive unity (Beiser, 2005). Deleuze's philosophy is the opposite: it is a machine for creating and affirming differences that *do not* resolve into a higher unity. His world, as he describes it, is not a unified continent but "an archipelago," a "wall of loose, uncemented stones, where every element has a value in itself but also in relation to others" (Deleuze, 1997). Hegel seeks synthesis; Deleuze seeks connection without synthesis.

This leads to two completely different conceptions of freedom. Hegelian freedom belongs to the **Citizen**. It is the profound freedom of finding your proper place within a rational, organic whole and consciously willing its reality. Deleuzian freedom belongs to the **Nomad**. It is the freedom to create a "line of flight," to desert your assigned place and invent new ways of life in the spaces between established structures.

And here we arrive at a surprising conclusion. In exploring the ["Three Roads Forward,"](/post-63) it seemed that the most radical position was the "deep opt-out." But we now see that another kind of irreconcilable conflict may be between two rival forms of the "deep opt-in." Hegel's project is to rationalize and perfect the system from within. Deleuze's is to create new systems on the outside. One is a philosophy of the citizen, the other of the refugee. They are not allies in a shared project of engagement. They are enemy programs for how to live.

In [Post 98](/post-98), we arrived at a challenging conclusion: Hegel's and Deleuze's philosophies represent two "enemy opt-ins." But this raises a sharp and necessary question about the Deleuzian path. If his project is to create "new systems on the outside," as I put it, how can that be a "deep opt-in"? Doesn't creating something "outside" the system mean you've opted out? It's a fair question that gets to the heart of what makes Deleuze's form of engagement so different.

To clarify this, we first have to be very clear about what the "Deep Opt-Out" actually is. As this blog has defined it, the deep opt-out is a defensive posture. It's the path of the "beautiful soul" from the boycott series, a consciousness that, fearing moral contamination, chooses "principled withdrawal" from a corrupt world to preserve its own purity. Its primary goal is the *preservation* of a self that is imagined to pre-exist its engagement with the world. It is a retreat.

Deleuze's "outside" is not a fortress; it's a workshop. It is a space of profound and messy engagement with the materials of the world. The philosopher Joe Hughes provides a key insight here, arguing that Deleuze intentionally rejects the "postulate of goodwill." He is not a friendly guide but a "surly interlocutor" whose purpose is to break our unthinking habits. His method is an example of working "on the outside" while being deeply engaged. He practices a kind of "ventriloquism," getting so close to an author like Kant or Spinoza that he can make them produce a "monstrous offspring," a new idea that is both theirs and alien to them. This is not a retreat from the history of philosophy; it is an intense, transformative intervention within it. Bartleby himself performs this. He doesn't flee the office; he stays and creates a new reality *inside* the old one, operating "outside" its rules to transform it from within.

This reveals the fundamental difference between the two forms of opting in. The Hegelian "deep opt-in" is an opt-in to a system. The goal is for the Citizen to find their place and realize their freedom within the rational whole of "ethical life". It is an opt-in to a destination. The Deleuzian "deep opt-in," by contrast, is an opt-in to a process. It is a commitment to the perpetual, creative work of the Nomad, who actively engages with the world's materials to build new pathways and "lines of flight." As Hughes suggests, Deleuze's difficult prose is an "aesthetic education" designed to "engineer the basic failure of our reading habits" and force us into this creative process. To opt-in to Deleuze is to agree to this dangerous and open-ended project of thought itself.

The confusion comes from a spatial metaphor. The "outside" for Deleuze is not "away from the world" (the opt-out). It is "outside the world's established rules." The Deleuzian deep opt-in is therefore a commitment to the most engaged form of life possible: the constant work of creation at the edge of what already exists. It rejects the defensive purity of the beautiful soul and the stabilizing reconciliation of the Hegelian citizen in favor of the inventive path of the nomad.

post_number: 105
date: 2024-04-15
---

"The mass" (for me) is that knotted tangle of technique, bureaucracy, cliché, and now AI: everything optimized to move without friction. When all those threads coil together, they form something like a dense wiring that contains us and resists us. My question has been how to live without either worshiping this tangle of wires or disentangling entirely from it. Today is the Hegel post. It's a wager. What looks like a mass stops looking like a mass when you go in far enough and learn its logic.

### The Beautiful Soul (and why it stalls)

Hegel gives a name to a familiar posture: the *beautiful soul*. It preserves inner purity by refusing action in the compromised world. It judges, but it will not mediate. The line that sticks with me:

> "The self's immediate knowing that is certain of itself is law and duty. Its intention, through being its own intention, is what is right; all that is required is that it should know this, and should state its conviction that its knowing and willing are right." (Hegel, section 654)

That is the pathology in miniature. Inward certainty standing in for the work of mediation. A conscience that refuses content. A will that declares itself sufficient. Hegel thinks this cannot hold. Refusal hardens into paralysis. Purity becomes a prison.

### Deep opt-in

Hegel's counter-move is not "opt out" and not even "resist harder." It's *incorporation through understanding*. Go deep enough into the mass that the alien wiring starts to look like a system of connections instead of a snarl. Learn the contradictions as circuits not as hopeless shorts. The self changes here. It's not erased but mediated, finding freedom by willing the rational order you can now actually grasp.

- **Withdrawal (beautiful soul):** keep hands clean; condemn from the balcony.
- **Deep opt-in (Hegel):** descend into the machinery; reconcile self and world through institutions, history, action.

That sounds like surrender only if "system" is the only word we have for life together. Hegel's bet is different. The path out of alienation runs *through* the shared forms (ethical life) not around them. You don't beat the mass by standing outside. You dissolve its facelessness by learning its wiring until it becomes legible and livable.

Next post I'll contrast this with the Deleuzian tactic. Deleuze pushes aside incorporation in favor of a careful creation of pockets (minor spaces, lines of flight) where life can keep moving without being captured by the tangle.

Last post I sketched Hegel's wager. Enter the mass deeply enough and the alien wiring begins to show itself as an intelligible circuit. Today the counterpoint. Deleuze does not resolve the mass into clarity. He leaves it tangled. His strategy is to find or make little spaces inside it, what he calls lines of flight. Not incorporation, but deviation.

### Minor Literature as Strategy

In *Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature*, Deleuze and Guattari ask how one can live in a language not one's own. Kafka's answer is to destabilize it, make it stutter:

> "How many people today live in a language that is not their own? […] How to become a nomad and an immigrant and a gypsy in relation to one's own language? Kafka answers: steal the baby from its crib, walk the tight rope." (Deleuze & Guattari, 1986, p. 19)

This is the image of the minor. Not the deep integration of the Hegelian citizen but the fragile invention of life on a tight rope, inside the tangled wiring of the system but manipulating or outright clearing its threads until something else emerges.

### Difference Without Reconciliation

The metaphysical ground for this comes from Deleuze's *Difference and Repetition*. There he insists difference is not derivative of identity. It does not resolve into synthesis. It is generative in itself:

> "Repetition thus appears as difference without a concept, repetition which escapes indefinitely continued conceptual difference. It expresses a power peculiar to the existent, a stubbornness of the existent in intuition, which resists every specification by concepts." (Deleuze, 1968, p. 13)

That refusal of reconciliation is the point. For Deleuze, the mass does not become transparent through understanding. It remains a mass of knots, uneven and unpredictable. Freedom comes from moving through the gaps, weaving new strands, improvising connections that never tighten into a single design.

### Lines of Flight vs. Deep Opt-In

- **Hegel:** dissolve alienation by entering so fully the tangle becomes intelligible, even livable.
- **Deleuze:** keep the tangle tangled; carve lines of flight where invention can persist without reconciliation.

For me, that makes the Deleuzian strategy not a retreat but a discipline. Seek out the stutter, the deviation, the little archipelago inside the wiring where life can keep moving. No beautiful soul here. No deep incorporation either. Just the inventive persistence of the minor.

title: "Two Current AI Policies (Quoted & Explained)"
post_number: 107
date: 2024-04-17
---

Universities everywhere are drafting rules for how students can and cannot use generative AI. Two representative policies look something like this:

### Policy Statement 1: Unauthorized Use of Generative AI

> The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to produce academic work without the explicit authorization of the course instructor is a violation of the university's academic integrity policy. This includes, but is not limited to:
> 
> - Submitting AI-generated content (text, code, images, data, etc.) as your own original work.
> - Using an AI tool to complete or substantially assist with assignments, exams, or projects when such assistance is unauthorized.
> - Plagiarizing or paraphrasing content from an AI tool without proper citation, even if the source is not a human author.
> 
> Such unauthorized use is considered a form of cheating and/or plagiarism. Any violation will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include a failing grade on the assignment, a failing grade for the course, and other penalties in accordance with the university's academic misconduct procedures.

### Policy Statement 2: Permitted Use of Generative AI with Disclosure

> In some courses, instructors may permit the use of generative AI tools for specific, limited purposes. When an instructor has given express permission, students may use these tools under the following conditions:
> 
> **Instructor Approval:** Use of generative AI is only permitted when the instructor has specified it as an acceptable tool in the course syllabus or on a particular assignment's instructions.
> 
> **Required Disclosure and Attribution:** Students are required to disclose all instances of AI tool use. This disclosure must clearly describe how the tool was used and its contribution to the final work. Proper citation of the AI tool is mandatory, following the citation style specified by the instructor (e.g., MLA, APA).
> 
> Examples of permitted uses may include:
> 
> - Using an AI tool for brainstorming, generating initial outlines, or refining research questions.
> - Using an AI tool for grammar, spelling, or syntax checks.
> 
> It is the student's responsibility to verify the accuracy and originality of all AI-generated content and to ensure the final submission adheres to all course requirements.

### What These Policies Expect

1. **Instructor as gatekeeper:** Students may only use AI if authorized by the instructor.
2. **Mandatory disclosure:** When permitted, students must report every instance and describe the tool's contribution, with citation.
3. **Equivalence to cheating (when unauthorized):** Unauthorized AI use is grouped with plagiarism/cheating.

### A Simple Rejection

These policies treat writing methods as a public commodity subject to permission and surveillance. They collapse the difference between plagiarism (a harm to others) and method (an individual's private intellectual process). I reject these as insufficiently robust when it comes to student freedom.

post_number: 108

Both policies assume students' methods belong to the university to monitor and regulate. John Stuart Mill, in *On Liberty*, gives a better principle:

> *"The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest."*

### Why It Matters for Students

- **Self-regarding conduct:** Methods (how one drafts, researches, or tools) belong to the student's "own way."
- **Other-regarding wrongs:** Plagiarism deceives and harms; that's a different category.
- **Freedom to experiment:** Students need room to try tools and processes without compelled disclosure.

title: "Objection 1: \"Students Won't Learn to Write\""
post_number: 109
date: 2024-04-19
---

**The objection:** If students use AI to write, they will not learn how to write themselves. Professors are responsible for teaching writing, so they must prevent shortcuts that bypass the learning process.

At first glance, this objection has force. Professors want their students to develop skills. They don't want them to cheat themselves of practice.

### A Mill Passage

> *"Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest."*

### Applying Mill's Principle

Students come to university with diverse aims. One may want to develop sentence-level craft; another may want to learn how to supervise and edit machine-assisted writing; another may want to master research acceleration with AI. All of these are legitimate intellectual goals.

The objection assumes there is only one valid end: learning to write by hand, word by word. But Mill teaches that ends belong to the individual. Professors should not compel students to pursue *their* vision of what the student's goals should be.

Yes, professors are guides. But their role is not to dictate purposes. Their role is to act as a support for the student's own intellectual life, helping them achieve what *they* see as valuable, within clear anti-deception rules (e.g., no plagiarism).

### My Response

If a student decides that learning how to use AI effectively is the most valuable skill for them, then that is a legitimate use of their education. The professor's duty is not to block that choice but to help the student pursue it as well as possible: designing assignments that make supervision, editing, verification, and critical judgment visible and assessable, rather than banning the tool.

In Mill's terms, society "gains more" when individuals are allowed to live and learn "as seems good to themselves." Restrictions that enforce one pedagogical path (on the theory that it is universally best) produce conformity more than flourishing. Guard the boundary against *harms* (fraud, misrepresentation); within that boundary, leave method to the student.

title: "Objection 2: \"AI Writing Harms Others and the University\""
post_number: 110
date: 2024-04-20
---

**The objection:** If AI use becomes common, it harms other students who want "human-only" writing credentials. It also harms the university if it cannot uphold its standards of "strong writing" as human-authored thought.

### A Mill Passage

> *"As soon as any part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it [...] But there is no room for entertaining any such question when a person's conduct affects the interests of no persons besides himself [...] In all such cases, there should be perfect freedom, legal and social, to do the action and stand the consequences."*

### Applying Mill's Principle

1. **Other students.** Do they lose a right when peers use AI? Their liberty to pursue human-only craft is untouched; their grades and degree requirements are set by their own performance. What changes is comparative *prestige* or a preferred pecking order of methods. For Mill, that is not the sort of concrete injury that justifies coercion.

2. **The university.** Institutions may define assessment criteria. But invoking "standards" to suppress legitimate variation in method is the classic slide from education to moulding. Mill warns that enforced sameness, even in the name of improvement, erodes individuality. Uniform inputs do not guarantee genuine excellence; diverse "experiments of living" do.

### Response

Genuine harms remain sanctionable: plagiarism, misrepresentation, fabrication, privacy violations. Those are other-regarding wrongs. By contrast, choosing tools and workflows falls within the self-regarding sphere. It may unsettle tradition or status hierarchies, but discomfort and loss of comparative advantage are not Mill-style harms.

Universities can protect integrity without prescribing inner process: require students to demonstrate *reasoned agency* (show revisions, source evaluation, verification of claims), not to disclose or conform their *methods*. This preserves standards of outcome while respecting autonomy in means.

title: "The Student's Right to Their Own Methods"
post_number: 111
---

A professor might say: *"We value transparency here. Honesty requires everyone to share how they work so others can benefit. If you're not doing anything wrong, why hide your methods?"*

It sounds fair. Who could be against honesty and sharing? But in practice, this demand cuts into something vital: the student's ownership of their intellectual methods.

### Mill on the Experiments of Living

> *"It is desirable, in short, that in things which do not primarily concern others, individuality should assert itself. Where, not the person's own character, but the traditions or customs of other people are the rule of conduct, there is wanting one of the principal ingredients of human happiness, and quite the chief ingredient of individual and social progress."*

Intellectual methods (how one gathers, organizes, verifies, drafts, and transforms material) are precisely such "experiments." They belong to the inward domain where individuality should assert itself.

### Why Methods Matter (Concrete Stakes)

- **Creative property:** A distinctive workflow (research pipelines, note taxonomies, prompt/playbooks, edit heuristics) is part of what makes a writer's work valuable. Compelled disclosure socializes that value.
- **Competitive advantage:** Students legitimately compete by developing better processes. Mandatory transparency erodes the advantage of hard-won method and turns invention into compliance.
- **Risk-taking under privacy:** Breakthroughs often come from "foolish-looking" experiments. Surveillance chills experimentation and selects for safe orthodoxy.
- **Method ≠ morality:** Treating private process as a public virtue test (confess your method, or you're "hiding") confuses honesty with exposure. It replaces integrity of outcomes with policing of interiors.
- **Scope creep into sanctions:** Once methods are compelled into the open, they become targetable by taste-based rules. Students lose freedom not because they harmed anyone but because they worked "the wrong way."

### Answering "If You're Not Doing Wrong, Why Hide?"

This is the language of surveillance, not education. Mill warns that social pressure easily extends beyond preventing harm into enforcing sameness. Privacy here protects autonomy, creativity, and diversification of approaches. Universities can demand *truthful outcomes* (source accuracy, argument quality, proper attribution) without conscripting *inner process* into public inspection.

### Claim

The student has a strong and legitimate interest in saying: "My methods are mine; I will choose what, if anything, to reveal." What they lose under compulsory transparency is not just privacy but the special value of their work: the freedom to build unique processes of thought and let those processes bear fruit in their writing.

# GRAD-STUDENT-CONTEXT — Blog Posts

## What this section is (and isn’t)

**Blog Posts** are the site's *out-of-character* academic writing: real essays, arguments, and work-in-progress reflections by Professor Plate. Think of them as a public research notebook for literary theory, hermeneutics, and AI interpretation — exploratory, first-person, and scholarly-but-readable. They are distinct from the two theory kits (systematic, instructional) and the fictional collections (Archive, Debate)【turn6file0†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L13-L20】【turn6file3†README.md†L21-L27】.

**Belongs here**
- Theoretical explorations and arguments
- Hermeneutics and method questions
- AI & interpretation reflections
- Literary-critical insights; hypotheses-in-progress【turn6file0†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L29-L37】

**Does *not* belong here**
- Systematic frameworks → move to Romantic or AI Hermeneutics kits
- Fictional documents → move to `_archive/`
- Meta-archival debates → move to `_debate/`【turn6file0†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L38-L41】

---

## What the posts are actually about (typical subject matter)

The posts revolve around a recurring set of problems and curiosities. If you’re scouting topics or trying to place a draft, start by locating it in one of these bands:

1) **Hermeneutics & Method-in-Use**  
   How we read; why methods help or mislead; where interpretation breaks down. Expect pieces that question assumptions, stage a problem, and leave a thread for later systematizing【turn6file6†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L80-L97】.

2) **AI & Interpretation**  
   What AI-generated texts do to authorship, intention, and reading. Posts often test the idea that AI’s “newness” is an *intensification* of classic hermeneutic issues rather than a rupture (e.g., author-function, distanciation, dialogue, risk)【turn6file12†aggregate-ai-hermeneutics.md†L10-L18】.

3) **Romanticism as a Live Method Bank**  
   Romantic concepts show up as tools: authenticity/sincerity, organic vs. mechanical form, technology & the machine, historical contexts. Posts try these ideas on contemporary problems before a kit-page formalizes them【turn6file4†README.md†L31-L37】.

4) **Meta-critique, Pedagogy, and Scholarly Practice**  
   Freedom to experiment; skepticism toward compelled disclosure of method; wariness of surveillance logics in academia. These pieces defend process freedom, argue that privacy can protect creativity, and separate integrity of outcomes from policing of interiors【turn6file13†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L43-L46】【turn6file10†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L2-L6】【turn6file10†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L9-L14】.

5) **Bridgework Across Collections**  
   Posts sketch ideas that later become kit pages (Romantic or AI Hermeneutics) or inspire fictional seeds for Archive/Debate. They’re the staging area for the site’s integrated system【turn6file2†aggregate-structural-files.md†L32-L36】【turn6file3†README.md†L63-L66】.

---

## The “thesis” or governing perspective of the posts

- **Exploration over edict.** Posts privilege open questions and provisional thinking; the blog is where problems are staged before being formalized in a kit【turn6file0†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L24-L28】【turn6file2†aggregate-structural-files.md†L32-L36】.

- **Writers’ freedom, not method policing.** The project’s stance favors experimentation, tolerates mixed toolchains (AI or not), and resists compelled process transparency; privacy can enable originality and risk-taking【turn6file13†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L15-L19】【turn6file13†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L43-L46】【turn6file10†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L2-L6】.

- **AI as continuity-with-intensification.** AI doesn’t make interpretation alien; it amplifies old hermeneutic tensions (author-function, performativity, distanciation, dialogue, risk), which we adapt rather than discard【turn6file12†aggregate-ai-hermeneutics.md†L10-L18】.

- **Scholarly but accessible voice.** First-person, reflective, academically responsible prose that aims to be readable without dumbing down【turn6file3†README.md†L21-L27】【turn6file0†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L22-L28】.

- **Posts are the engine of the site’s ecosystem.** Ideas tested here become frameworks (kits) and fictional prompts (Archive/Debate), keeping real theory and world-building in reciprocity【turn6file3†README.md†L63-L66】.

---

## Canonical threads & representative prompts

Use these to generate or categorize drafts:

- *Authorship without an Author?* (author-function, death of the author, regulatory fictions)  
  “If training data and prompt-patterns stand in for an ‘author,’ what does intention even mean here?”

- *Organic vs. Mechanical Form (today).*  
  “Where does ‘organic form’ survive (or fail) in a world of generative constraints and templates?”

- *Performativity & Parody in models.*  
  “When a model seems to ‘perform’ a genre, what counts as iteration vs. transformation?”

- *Distanciation & Dialogue.*  
  “What does ‘dialogue’ mean when outputs are decoupled from consciousness yet responsive to us?”

- *Pedagogical Risk, Privacy, and Innovation.*  
  “Which practices should remain private so that risky thinking can happen without sanctions?”【turn6file10†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L2-L6】【turn6file10†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L9-L14】

(You’ll find these same motifs, in systematic form, throughout the two kits: author-function, performativity, assemblage, distanciation, organic/mechanical, technology & the machine【turn6file8†aggregate-structural-files.md†L13-L21】【turn6file4†README.md†L41-L47】.)

---

## Reading the room: who this is for and how posts are used

**Audience.** Scholars, students, and theoretically curious readers looking for rigorous but welcoming prose【turn6file3†README.md†L21-L27】.

**How readers move.** Many will start on `/posts/`, follow a thread, and then jump to a kit page or (via the Addendum seeds) notice an Archive/Debate analogue. There are 110+ posts to date, organized chronologically with post numbers【turn6file0†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L80-L84】【turn6file1†aggregate-structural-files.md†L6-L8】.

---

## The Densworld Addendum (required)

Every post ends with an out-of-character **Densworld Addendum** (2–6 sentences) that speculates about a Densworld analogue or figurative reworking of the post’s idea. It is a **seed** for future Archive/Debate work and remains **out-of-character** (a hand-off, not fiction)【turn6file2†aggregate-structural-files.md†L30-L36】.

**Include**
- A concrete Densworld image, device, practice, or scene your post suggests
- A **proposed Order** (Boundary; Doubling; Craving; Silence & Withdrawal; Violence & Secret Life; Mediation & Aperture) and a **likely Region** (Capital; Dens/Densmok; Quarry; North/Northo; Tower/Sticks; Dead River; Capeast)【turn6file15†README.md†L1-L7】【turn6file15†README.md†L9-L17】
- Optional: a likely **Debate** document type (memo, minute, hearing, counter-memo)

**Example**
> **Densworld Addendum (seed):** The “authenticity vs. performance” tension could surface in **North Town** as a murder-song requiring a masked **echoer** to confirm each line (→ **Doubling**). A clerk in **Capital** proposes banning masked echoers in depositions (→ potential **Counter-Memo** in Debate).

---

## Success criteria for a strong post

- **Intellectual honesty** (admit uncertainty; note counterarguments)  
- **Accessible complexity** (define terms; keep paragraphs readable)  
- **Original thinking** (not mere summary)  
- **Useful bridges** (links to relevant kit pages; a concrete Addendum seed with Order/Region)【turn6file5†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L18-L23】【turn6file14†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L35-L39】

---

## Quick orientation for the brand-new grad student

1) Read 5–7 recent posts to hear the voice (first-person, reflective, rigorous).  
2) Skim the **Romantic Quick Kit** and **AI Hermeneutics Kit** hubs to learn the concepts you’ll see referenced in posts【turn6file4†README.md†L26-L35】【turn6file4†README.md†L39-L47】.  
3) Notice how each post leaves a *live gap* — a question for later. That gap often becomes either a new kit page or a fictional seed.  
4) When in doubt, ask: *Is my draft an exploration (post), a framework (kit), or a fictional artifact (archive/debate)?* Place accordingly【turn6file0†aggregate-blog-posts.md†L66-L76】.

# Graduate Student Workflow — Blog Posts

## Quick Overview

**Blog Posts** are the site's *out-of-character* academic writing: real essays, arguments, and work-in-progress reflections by Professor Plate. They serve as a public research notebook for literary theory, hermeneutics, and AI interpretation — exploratory, first-person, and scholarly-but-readable.

### Key Principle:
This is **authentic academic blogging** — first person, reflective, conversational but scholarly. Posts function as the **engine of the site's ecosystem**, with ideas tested here becoming frameworks (kits) and fictional prompts (Archive/Debate).

---

## Step 1: Identify Your Subject Area

Focus your post within one of these **five recurring bands**:

### 1. Hermeneutics & Method-in-Use
- How we read; why methods help or mislead; where interpretation breaks down
- Questions assumptions, stages problems, leaves threads for later systematizing

### 2. AI & Interpretation  
- What AI-generated texts do to authorship, intention, and reading
- Tests the idea that AI's "newness" intensifies classic hermeneutic issues rather than creating rupture

### 3. Romanticism as a Live Method Bank
- Romantic concepts as tools: authenticity/sincerity, organic vs. mechanical form, technology & the machine
- Tries ideas on contemporary problems before kit-pages formalize them

### 4. Meta-critique, Pedagogy, and Scholarly Practice
- Freedom to experiment; skepticism toward compelled disclosure of method
- Defends process freedom, argues that privacy can protect creativity

### 5. Bridgework Across Collections
- Sketches ideas that later become kit pages or inspire fictional seeds for Archive/Debate
- The staging area for the site's integrated system

### What Does NOT Belong Here:
- Systematic frameworks → move to Romantic or AI Hermeneutics kits
- Fictional documents → move to `_archive/`
- Meta-archival debates → move to `_debate/`

---

## Step 2: Choose Your Voice & Approach

### Blog Post Voice Markers:
- **First person**: "I think," "This strikes me as," "I've been wondering"
- **Conversational but scholarly**: Direct address to readers, informal asides
- **Provisional**: "This might be wrong, but..." "I'm still working through..."
- **Reflective**: Questions that open rather than close discussions

### Tone Examples:
✓ "This puzzles me about AI interpretation..."  
✓ "I've been reading Butler's work and wondering..."  
✓ "Something about this Romantic concept bothers me..."  
✗ "Butler's theory of performativity states..." (too systematic for blog posts)  
✗ "The archivist noted the following slip..." (fictional, belongs in `_archive/`)

---

## Step 3: Technical Specifications

### File Naming:
```
2024-MM-DD-post-[number].md
```
Example: `2024-01-15-post-25.md`

### Required Front Matter:
```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
post_number: [integer]
date: 2024-01-15 10:00:00 -0500
---
```

### File Location:
Place in: `_posts/your-filename.md`

---

## Step 4: Content Structure

### Flexible Structure Options:

#### Option A: Question-Driven Post
1. **Opening question/problem**: What's puzzling you?
2. **Exploration**: Work through the thinking
3. **Provisional conclusion**: Where you've landed (for now)

#### Option B: Reading Response Post  
1. **What you're reading**: Book, article, theory
2. **What strikes you**: Key insights or problems
3. **Implications**: How this affects your thinking

#### Option C: Methodological Post
1. **The method/approach**: What you're trying to do
2. **The problem**: Where it breaks down or gets complicated
3. **Possible solutions**: Tentative ways forward

---

## Step 5: Content Guidelines

### Length & Depth:
- **Short posts (200-500 words)**: Single insight, quick reflection
- **Medium posts (500-1000 words)**: Developed argument, reading response
- **Long posts (1000+ words)**: Complex exploration, multiple threads

### Academic Standards:
- **Cite sources** when referencing specific works
- **Define terms** when introducing complex concepts
- **Acknowledge uncertainty** — it's okay not to have answers
- **Connect to larger questions** in literary theory and hermeneutics

### Voice Consistency:
- Maintain **first person** throughout
- Keep **conversational but scholarly** tone
- Show **thinking process**, not just conclusions
- **Question assumptions**, including your own

---

## Step 6: Integration with Site Ecosystem

### How Blog Posts Connect to Other Collections:

#### To Theory Collections (`_romantic/`, `_ai_hermeneutics/`):
- Blog posts **explore** ideas that later get **systematized** in theory collections
- Use blog posts to **work through problems** before formalizing frameworks
- Reference theory collections when you've already developed systematic approaches

#### To Fictional Collections (`_archive/`, `_debate/`):
- Blog posts can **reflect on the creative process** behind fictional work
- Can discuss **interpretive principles** that get demonstrated fictionally
- Should **NOT** contain fictional content directly

### Linking Examples:
```markdown
I've been developing this idea systematically in my 
[Romantic Quick Kit]({{ '/romantic/romantic-quick-kit/' | relative_url }}), 
but here I want to think through some problems...

This connects to the interpretive challenges I've been exploring 
in the [AI Hermeneutics framework]({{ '/ai-hermeneutics/ai-hermeneutics-kit/' | relative_url }})...
```

---

## Step 7: Canonical Threads & Representative Prompts

Use these to generate or categorize drafts:

### Authorship without an Author?
- "If training data and prompt-patterns stand in for an 'author,' what does intention even mean here?"
- "The author-function gets complicated when..."

### Organic vs. Mechanical Form (today)
- "Where does 'organic form' survive (or fail) in a world of generative constraints and templates?"
- "Romantic authenticity meets algorithmic generation..."

### Performativity & Parody in Models
- "When a model seems to 'perform' a genre, what counts as iteration vs. transformation?"
- "This AI text feels like parody, but parody of what?"

### Distanciation & Dialogue
- "What does 'dialogue' mean when outputs are decoupled from consciousness yet responsive to us?"
- "Traditional hermeneutics breaks down when..."

### Pedagogical Risk, Privacy, and Innovation
- "Which practices should remain private so that risky thinking can happen without sanctions?"
- "I'm trying a new approach to [problem], but I'm not ready to defend it yet..."

---

## Step 8: Workflow Process

### Daily Practice:
1. **Read/research** — engage with primary and secondary sources
2. **Note questions** — what puzzles or interests you?
3. **Draft quickly** — capture thinking while it's active
4. **Revise for clarity** — make accessible without losing complexity
5. **Post and iterate** — use reader feedback to develop ideas further

### Weekly Planning:
- **Monday**: Theoretical exploration
- **Tuesday**: Reading response  
- **Wednesday**: Methodological question
- **Thursday**: AI/hermeneutics reflection
- **Friday**: Open/miscellaneous

### Monthly Themes:
- Develop **recurring threads** across multiple posts
- **Build complexity** over time through linked explorations
- **Connect to course content** if you're teaching
- **Respond to current events** in academic/literary world

---

## Step 9: Quality Standards

### Content Quality:
- **Intellectual honesty** — admit uncertainty, acknowledge counterarguments
- **Accessible complexity** — sophisticated ideas in readable prose
- **Original thinking** — engage critically, don't just summarize
- **Scholarly engagement** — cite sources, join conversations

### Technical Quality:
- **Clear writing** — edit for clarity and flow
- **Proper citations** — academic integrity in all references
- **Jekyll formatting** — ensure markdown renders correctly
- **Link functionality** — test all internal and external links

---

## Step 10: The Densworld Addendum (REQUIRED)

Every post must end with an out-of-character **Densworld Addendum** (2–6 sentences) that speculates about a Densworld analogue for the post's idea. This is a **seed** for future Archive/Debate work and remains **out-of-character** (a hand-off, not fiction).

### Include:
- A concrete Densworld image, device, practice, or scene your post suggests
- A **proposed Order** (Boundary; Doubling; Craving; Silence & Withdrawal; Violence & Secret Life; Mediation & Aperture)
- A **likely Region** (Capital; Dens/Densmok; Quarry; North/Northo; Tower/Sticks; Dead River; Capeast)
- Optional: a likely **Debate** document type (memo, minute, hearing, counter-memo)

### Example Addendum:
```markdown
**Densworld Addendum (seed):** The "authenticity vs. performance" tension could surface in **North Town** as a murder-song requiring a masked **echoer** to confirm each line (→ **Doubling**). A clerk in **Capital** proposes banning masked echoers in depositions (→ potential **Counter-Memo** in Debate).
```

title: "The Problem with Romantic Sincerity"
post_number: 47

I've been working through the authenticity concept in my Romantic Quick Kit, 
but something keeps bothering me about how we usually think about sincerity...

[2-3 paragraphs exploring the problem]

This connects to a larger question about whether interpretation can ever 
be truly "authentic" to an author's intentions, especially when we're 
dealing with AI-generated texts...

[2-3 paragraphs developing the connection]

I don't have a clean answer yet, but I think the issue might be that 
we're using "sincerity" when we really mean something more like 
"systematic coherence"...

[Concluding thoughts, questions for further exploration]

**Densworld Addendum (seed):** The "authenticity vs. performance" tension could surface in **North Town** as a murder-song requiring a masked **echoer** to confirm each line (→ **Doubling**). A clerk in **Capital** proposes banning masked echoers in depositions (→ potential **Counter-Memo** in Debate).

This workflow maintains the **authentic academic voice** while systematically connecting each post to the broader site ecosystem through the Densworld seeding system.
