title: "Archive Post C1 — Dens: Boundary Sludge Meter Readings (west-ditch series, yrs 17–19)"
order: "Boundary"

excerpt: "The staff reads what the mouths say. Our sticks rise with the stories of swallowing, fall with the stories of safe streets."

**Catalog Code:** C1

## Provenance

West Ditch Survey, field staff *R-5* through *R-7*; monthly stick-depth and pan-grit captures.
Auxiliary transcripts from tavern stools on the western road (compiled by lane-runners).
Labels standardized by South Arcade Registrar's office (Year 20, Q1).

## Extract — Boundary Accounts

> In one account: Dens is "a regular town… on the edge of the western wilderness."
> In the other: "the wilderness… always in danger of sinking [the town] further into it,"
> with grit "heaping… by the day" until "the one will be indistinguishable from the other."

## Meter Series — West Ditch (Years 17–19)

| Month | Y17 Depth (cm) | Y18 Depth (cm) | Y19 Depth (cm) | Notes |
|-------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Frost | 18 | 22 | 27 | Grit coarsening; 3 cracked pans |
| Thaw | 31 | 35 | 41 | Sludge "creeps" across marker stones |
| Seed | 24 | 29 | 36 | Two homes report porchline loss |
| High Sun | 19 | 23 | 28 | Temporary retreat after ditching |
| Harvest | 26 | 33 | 39 | Sticky pull under footbridges |
| Black | 34 | 40 | 47 | Overtop at culverts R-6 & R-7 |

## Archivist's Commentary

The staff reads what the mouths say. Our sticks rise with the stories of swallowing,
fall with the stories of safe streets. The boundary does not stay put: it moves with the hour,
the season, the ditching. We file these numbers beside the stool transcripts, not to reconcile
them, but to keep the circle whole: town and wilderness reading through each other. When a porch
line vanishes overnight, we note it the way we note a new proverb—evidence of where the edge went
while no one was watching.

title: "Archive Post B2 — Densmok: Two Kinds of Story about Dens (oral histories, stool transcripts)"
order: "Boundary"
region: "Densmok"
catalog_code: "B2"
excerpt: "Town and wilderness read like two halves of a circle our witnesses keep turning through: settlement becoming exile, exile folding back into a harder settlement."
---

**Catalog Code:** B2

## Provenance

Compiled from west-edge Densmok stool transcripts and lane interviews; cross-checked with
ditch-readers' ledgers and three roadside sermons recovered from the north spur into Dens.

## Extract

> There are two kinds of story you'll hear about Dens.
> In one: a regular town—dirty, small, out on the edge.
> In the other: the wilderness itself is alive, thickening by the day, pushing up against houses
> until streets and buildings are only the faintest rises under the grit. In either telling, the name
> *Dens* belongs as much to the wilderness as to the town—and some say the two are already the same.

## Archivist's Commentary

The accounts refuse to stay separate. "Town" and "wilderness" read like two halves of a circle
our witnesses keep turning through: settlement becoming exile, exile folding back into a harder
settlement. We have no single "before" and "after" here, only a loop of approaches where each
version makes the other legible. Readers who want a stable Dens must accept a moving boundary:
every whole appears only through its parts—and the parts keep drifting.

title: "Archive Post H1 — Tower of Mirado: 'Edges to Edges' (puzzle catechism notes)"
order: "Boundary"
region: "Tower of Mirado"
catalog_code: "H1"
excerpt: "A rule repeated until it turns itself: the Tower's way is to make speech lay the track for the hand. The child's voice carries the fit forward; the picture follows later."
---

**Catalog Code:** H1

## Provenance

Tutor's notebook recovered from a Tower-adjacent instruction room; marginalia by a parent-scribe.
Supplementary pages from a catechetical handout filed under "Repetition & Fit." Copied twice
by Capital junior clerks; Tower origin unconfirmed.

## Extract

> "Edges to edges," said at each misfit; the child turns the piece. 
> Repetition of language creates the experience of fit—and the possibility of communication.

## Lesson Record — Unit 3: Fitting

- **Drill:** identify edges; rotate non-edges; retry without prompt
- **Chorus:** class repeats rule before each attempt ("edges to edges")
- **Observation:** self-prompt emerges in child after 7–9 repetitions
- **Transfer:** rule applied to a different picture (pond → cabin)

## Archivist's Commentary

A rule repeated until it turns itself: the Tower's way is to make speech lay the track for the hand.
The child's voice carries the fit forward; the picture follows later. We file this with confession
manuals and rehab scripts not to collapse them but to keep their cadence together: repetition that
builds a world of correct joins, taught at the table one corner at a time.

title: "Archive Post C2 — Dead River: Queenmater Handouts (dose ledger & franchise route)"
order: "Craving"
region: "Dead River"
catalog_code: "C2"
excerpt: "A sheet names forms of craving; a show standardizes dose. Appetite learns its meter on the street."
layout: archive
---

**Catalog Code:** C2

## Provenance

Dead River · Street-circulated **Queenmater** “cheat” sheets; domestic witness to the **Dead River Whores** franchise (comic → TV); town speech motto logged at the limits.

## Extract

> || This thing will never be resolved. These handouts keep getting circulated all over town. I don’t know who this “Queenmater” person is. ||

> || Queenmater Handouts -- Seven Ways of Words, Seven Forms of the Craving ||

> || Dead River Whores was a TV show Cora’s son unfortunately watched all the time. Five episodes in a day if she let him. It had been a comic before someone made it a show, and now Evan was buying up old volumes and leaving them around where Yoyo, who was only ten, could see those awful covers, each with an almost naked woman dead in some ghastly way. ||

> || Someone heard it was going to be an album… He thought it could be a game. It might be. A game about Dead River. ||

> || Only bad things happen for a reason. Good things? Who knows and who cares. ||

## Archivist’s Commentary

Filed **Craving** (primary). The handout walks the streets naming **forms of craving**; the category becomes a **meter** people carry, not a gloss. The franchise regularizes a **dose** (“five episodes in a day”) and trains a **gaze** (covers as lesson), so appetite arrives with a schedule and a look. The motto supplies a counting rule—**causality is reserved for harm**—which tilts attention toward injuries and away from gifts; it’s a speech-device that tallies desire by what goes wrong. Cross-index (light): **Violence & Secret Life** (harm laundered as after-school time); **Mediation & Aperture** (formats—handout, panel, episode—function as apertures routing appetite). Region marks provenance (Dead River), but the mechanism—**how craving learns its beat**—is the reason for the file.

title: "Archive Post B1 — Densmok: Theorists in the Shadow (mind-node rigs catalog)"
order: "Craving"
region: "Densmok"
catalog_code: "B1"
excerpt: "Densmok works in the shadow of the Capital, but the shadow is a workshop. The 'singers' treat code as breath and beat; their rigs splice chant to patch."
---

**Catalog Code:** B1

## Provenance

Compiled by Junior Registrar M. Leth (seconded to Densmok). Sources: alley shop receipts, street-lab
inventories, tutor-stool transcripts from "singers" (coder-performers), and four confiscations logged
by Cap auxiliaries. Cross-checked against mnemonist pairing reports at the Quarry line.

## Extract — Registered Rigs (selected)

| Rig / Handle | Build Notes | Use-Method | Observed Side-Effects |
|-------------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Node-3 "Broomhandle"** | Walnut dowel spine; three copper knuckles; clinic-cast ear-cuff | Hummed stanza to prime; finger-tap 5-count to engage | Ear-ringing; doubled whisper; brief dream bleed |
| **Tin-Ear 2.1** | Roof-tin plates; scavenged radio coil; soot-strung leads | Call-and-response "singing"; two voices recommended | Speech stutter on exit; delayed afterimages |
| **Frege-Patch ("Just Pete")** | Ledger vellum over waxboard; pinwheel selector; blue chalk | Trace letters until "click"; recite stock proofs | Compulsive recitation; taste of salt and graphite |
| **Mind-Node "Tin Chapel"** | Milk-crate chassis; six-node crown; bellwire ligature | Low chant; neighbor holds the crown steady | Momentary blackout; paired mirroring with bystander |

## Archivist's Commentary

Densmok works in the shadow of the Capital, but the shadow is a workshop. The "singers" treat code
as breath and beat; their rigs splice chant to patch. We file two routes upward: the *node*
pipeline (coders grooming their signal for the city) and the *pairing* pipeline (mnemonists
who double and mirror in the Quarry style). Interference between the two is common: a node crown
picks up a pairing echo; a pairing run jams a node stanza. What the Capital calls derivative feels
here like invention under constraint. We record the stutters, hums, and afterimages because the
side-effects are part of the method: the work leaves a mark where it passes.

title: "Archive Post D2 — Yeller Quarry: Bagbu on Roads & Doubles (archive district minutes)"
order: "Doubling"
region: "Quarry"
catalog_code: "D2"
excerpt: "We were instructed once to identify an origin and a fork. The slips will not allow it. What looks like a duplicate keeps making new directions."
---

**Catalog Code:** D2

## Provenance

Minutes from the Bagbu colloquy ("On Roads"), Capital archives district, with addenda from border
runners; annotations by a junior registrar regarding "journeys that breed journeys."

## Extract

> Every true journey begins in the Quarry, they say, and pushes toward the desert and its tower.
> But midway a second road buds off inside the first—sometimes years earlier than anyone can date.
> The maps cannot agree which is the copy and which is the line. Each path throws another.

## Archivist's Commentary

We were instructed once to identify an origin and a fork. The slips will not allow it. What looks
like a duplicate keeps making new directions; what looks like a main road is already a seam.
Our ledger overflows whenever we try to count. For Quarry matters we recommend a different verb:
not "to begin," but "to proliferate."

## File: ./doubling-quarry-hunt-silhouettes-d1.md

title: "Archive Post D1 — Yeller Quarry: The Hunt Silhouettes (Castelia woodcuts, provenance file)"
order: "Doubling"
region: "Quarry"
catalog_code: "D1"
excerpt: "The market wants a single cut—an origin to worship. The slips refuse it. Even where the burr repeats, the wrists don't; even where the jaw aligns, the paper lies."
---

**Catalog Code:** D1

## Provenance

Five woodcuts attributed to *Castelia*, acquired from Capital alley dealers (Lot 41–45).
Dealer bills claim "Yeller Quarry Hunt" origin; two impressions bear alley-stamp ink, one has a
partial chapel watermark. Comparison set includes three postcard-scale copies and one painted
facsimile on tin. Lot intake photographed and dusted; edges measured against known Castelia blocks.

## Extract — Trade & Image

> "The fivefold figure in silhouette… the famous Yeller Quarry Hunt depiction by Castelia."
> Trinket images sold in Capital alleys as patron-saint mementos; more sightings claimed in Dead River,
> fewer in the Capital; almost none who claim to have truly seen her.

## Findings — Block & Copy

- **Block-line:** Two cuts share a burr consistent with Castelia's late period; three do not.
- **Ink & stock:** Alley-ink mix on all; chapel watermark likely a pasted backing.
- **Pose-variance:** Silhouettes differ at wrists and jawline; "fivefold" reads as seam, not count.
- **Copy-chain:** Postcard set copies the burr but loses the wrist flare; tin facsimile invents both.

## Archivist's Commentary

The market wants a single cut—an origin to worship. The slips refuse it. Even where the burr
repeats, the wrists don't; even where the jaw aligns, the paper lies. We file the images as a
chase that throws its own doubles: a line of impressions that will not resolve to first or fifth.
As for the sightings, we keep the trinkets with the testimonies. Both are silhouette-work: light
around a body the ledgers cannot catch.

# GRAD-STUDENT-CONTEXT — The Archive and the World of Dens

> This is your **one-stop primer** to Densworld and to the Capital Archive that files it. You are not expected to read the ore files or every slip. Read this, skim the cross-links you need, then start drafting your first **in-character** archive slip. At you top, you fill find broad overviews of the regions of Densworld; following will be more focused context about the Archive within Densworld.

---

## Historian’s Overview of Densworld — A World of Orders, Regions, and Traveling Devices

Densworld is not only a geography; it’s a set of repeatable pressures that organize lives. The Archive models those pressures as **Orders**—Boundary; Doubling; Craving; Silence & Withdrawal; Violence & Secret Life; Mediation & Aperture—and it treats **Regions** as secondary (provenance rather than destiny). Read this as a historian’s long view: how the regions fit together, what devices bind them, and why the same motifs—maps, windows, carts, fives—keep surfacing wherever you look.

---

### The Capital (and Capeast): Architecture as Method, Bureaucracy as Aperture

The Capital is the center that throttles access. Its emblem is a **round window**—no door, just a circular aperture for slips, receipts, ledgers—calipered to tolerances and re-lacquered on schedule. Even the Senate stairs are built to slow bodies while privileging licensed knees. Capital’s doctrine is plain: **knowledge may pass; bodies may not**—architecture performs the Order of **Mediation & Aperture**.

Capeast is the Capital’s “after”—after work, after festival—where arrivals become paperwork. When the **mapmaker’s women** enter a harvest-night square, complaints begin with **cloth** (shoulders, bare rings on backs) before agency; the city files spectacle as ordinance. The women sometimes arrive **before** the mapmaker; their step is coordinated, their fittings intentionally varied—evidence that story lags practice. Capeast thus magnifies Capital’s logic: governing by **aperture** and **notice**, catching moving seams with stationary rules.

---

### Dens / Densmok: An Edge That Won’t Hold, and a Workshop in the Shadow

Dens is a town that is also a wilderness. Witnesses and ditch meters contradict each other: some say the grit is swallowing the town; others that the town has swollen, pushing the wild back. The Archive’s field logs learned to keep both and name the phenomenon **Boundary**—the **edge itself** is the content. In Dens, geography is an **act** (edge-shift), not a map coordinate.

Densmok, the industrial spill of Dens, turns constraint into invention. **Singers** here treat **code as breath and beat**, building rigs that splice chant to hardware; two upward “pipelines” develop—a node pipeline and a **pairing** pipeline—and they interfere with each other like crossed radio. The world’s famous “plot machine” also clicks on a Densmok night shift: “Two people with eyes closed… **A plot is the intersection of their stares**,” a device-rule that lets truth pass while bodies stay put—exactly Capital’s window logic, now rendered in software. Dens/Densmok together teach the Archive that an **edge** can be measured, and that a **form** can constrain truth: Boundary and Mediation, side by side.

---

### Yeller Quarry: Roads That Bud, Copies Without Origin, and the Respectable Commute

The Quarry’s proverb says: “Every true journey begins in the Quarry… **midway a second road buds off inside the first**… **Each path throws another**.” Maps cannot agree which line is original; what looks like the main road is already a seam. The Archive calls this **Doubling**—**proliferation without origin**.

The same pattern holds in the **Hunt** woodcuts attributed to Castelia. Five silhouettes share and refuse each other—burrs repeat while **wrists** and **jaws** won’t align—and the postcard/tin copies invent details the “originals” don’t have. Markets crave a first cut; the slips refuse it.

Socially, the Quarry is the **respectable commute into appetite**: “rich folk” sneak from Capital/Mirado to **eat off greasy tables and get off on greasy thighs**, then launder themselves on the return. Public ledger and private ledger do not meet; the Archive files the split under **Violence & Secret Life** with a cross-pull to **Craving**. Quarry routes, images, and appetites all rhyme as **recurrence that won’t resolve to a first**.

---

### North Town / Northo: Murder Songs and the Authorless Burden

North Town sings with **two ledgers at once**: a melody for the square and a confession for the alley. A recurring margin hand whispers, “**missionary is the killer**” while indexes log knives, creeks, borrowed names. The Archive knows North by the Order **Violence & Secret Life**: public performance paired with concealed harm.

Northo is where we see the **mapmaker’s pickbox cart** with clarity: a small cart “not quite larger than a wheelbarrow” that **opens into rooms upon rooms**, trailed by **five women** walking “as if roped though they were not.” He refuses food; they refuse his. The burden moves under its own rule, answerable to no single author. The cart will later travel across ledgers (Northo → North → Dead River), behaving less like a possession than a **method** the Archive classifies with **Mediation & Aperture** (a traveling aperture) and, at times, **Doubling** (rooms within rooms).

---

### Tower of Mirado / Mirado Sticks: When Speech Withdraws into the Hand

The Tower keeps **recursive speech**—words that teach technique. A catechism, **“edges to edges,”** repeated at each misfit, eventually **moves the child’s hand without being spoken**. The Tower’s own documents recognize this as a hinge: speech lays a track, then **withdraws**, leaving practice in the body. This is the Order **Silence & Withdrawal**: not absence, but a method whose **voice is scaffold**—meant to disappear once the structure stands.

Across the river, **Mirado Sticks** is the place of **quiet-hours**, where routers spike on surveillance threads and aides say, “Come back during quiet hours.” They **re-mark silence at dawn** and start loops again: hands before words, bodies before feeds. The Sticks’ clinic keeps **withdrawal logs**—“many returns begin with a broken screen and end in hand-work”—and catalogs cases (Cassie, E., Ria) where silence recovers a local grammar. Tower and Sticks are opposites that fit: catechism installs method; quiet-hours **maintain** it.

---

### Dead River: A Town Installed by Map, a Journey Enabled by Fire

Dead River has “no river… no church… no words because no speech,” yet it **is** a town because a **map named it**; **from that map, another map, and from that one, ten**. The Archive reads this as **Mediation & Aperture** (a **map-device** confers townhood) crossed with **Doubling** (maps-of-maps). Passage here is also **device-first**: **only Yeller** could make the crossing by sharing a **canistered flame**—a **carried fire** that mediates survival and movement.

Culturally, **Dead River Whores**—book, game, comic, imprint—**broke the Capital’s imaginative monopoly** and its harvest of attention. It is the through-plot of the boroughs, re-centering appetite and authorship far from the window’s rim. In Dead River, the Archive learned to say plainly: devices (map, flame) make places **possible**.

---

### Traveling Figures and Codes: Yeller, the Five, the Pickbox, Castelia

**Yeller** is both figure and **five**. Alley trinkets show a **fivefold silhouette**; sightings multiply across Dead River and the Quarry; debates fixate on **maintenance across generations** (are they immortal?). The Archive reads Yeller’s **fivefold** as code that threads song, image, and route: **“A yeller bird is a little flock of five… a yeller girl is a missing child…”**—public melody and private confession in one stanza.

The **pickbox cart** is a **region unto itself**—Gunnr-wood, bone, leather, corners beyond corners. Its operator listens for a **count**—specifically **five**—in a girl’s tapping; counting recruits; the burden **encloses** its own geography. In North Town, a murder song reports the cart **rolling without him**, a method with no confessor—**picking** as the only author that remains.

**Castelia’s** **Hunt** copies reinforce the same ontology: burrs repeat, **wrists** drift, **jaws** fail to align; postcard and tin **invent** what the “originals” lack. The market wants a first; the slips offer a **chain**.

Across these figures, the **structural pattern is recurrence without origin**; the Archive calls that **Doubling** and keeps **Region** only as a witness tag.

---

### How the Regions Relate (Narrative Lines You Can Follow)

* **Edge ⇄ Device.** Dens’s moving edge meets Capital’s fixed apertures: both limit or permit passage, one by **grit**, the other by **window**. Densmok’s plot device mirrors the window’s rule—**form admits truth, not bodies**.

* **Roads ⇄ Rooms.** Quarry roads **bud** new roads; the pickbox cart **opens inward** to rooms upon rooms. The first proliferates **outside**, the second **inside**—two faces of the same doubling engine.

* **Song ⇄ Image ⇄ Number.** North’s murder songs keep a **second ledger**; Quarry’s woodcuts refuse an **original**; Dead River and Yeller tie both to the **number five**. The same code travels as rhyme, silhouette, recruitment meter.

* **Festival ⇄ Filing.** Capeast’s festival aftermath records **complaint before agency**; the Capital’s window logs show the same impulse—**govern passage**, stamp tolerances. One is a parish note; the other, an inspection schedule.

* **Catechism ⇄ Quiet-Hours.** Tower’s **“edges to edges”** installs technique; Sticks **re-mark** silence each dawn to keep it. Two halves of **Silence & Withdrawal**: a voice that teaches, then leaves; a practice that persists.

---

### Why the Archive Files by Orders First

This world repeatedly shows **device before place**. A **map** makes a town; a **canistered flame** makes a journey; a **window** makes a policy; a **cart** makes its own rooms. Meanwhile, regions **proliferate** (Quarry roads), contradict (Dens boundary), or travel (Yeller’s fivefold). The Archive therefore shelves by what the document **does**—aperture, doubling, craving, boundary, withdrawal, secret life—and only then notes where it was found.

If you keep one historian’s sentence in mind while writing slips, keep this: **in Densworld, mechanisms generate geographies, and patterns outlast places.** The Archive’s task is to file the mechanisms and patterns, then let regions testify.


---

## 1) What the Archive is (and isn’t)

**The Archive** is a fictional, rigorous catalog of primary documents from Densworld. Slips are filed first by **Order** (the reality a document performs) and second by **Region** (where it comes from)  . The six **Orders**:

1. **Boundary** — edges that won’t hold
2. **Doubling** — copies without origin
3. **Craving** — appetite as engine
4. **Silence & Withdrawal** — truth through quiet practice
5. **Violence & Secret Life** — parallel harm ledgers
6. **Mediation & Aperture** — devices/windows that govern access .

**Regions** are secondary tags the Archive still tracks: **Capital, Dens/Densmok, Quarry, North Town/Northo, Tower/Sticks, Dead River, Capeast** .

**Voice.** Archive slips are **in-character** records authored by Capital archivists: professional, fragment-preserving, interpretive, and deliberately unresolved .

**Debate vs Archive.** The `_debate/` collection narrates the institution’s reorganization (four phases, clerkly ↔ romantic ↔ philosophical tensions). Use it sparingly for context; your slip belongs to the Archive, not the Debate .

---

## 2) How the Capital Archive works (what your job feels like)

**Orders-first filing.** After years of arguing, the Archive files by **Order** first and **Region** second, with mandatory cross-indexing across both when relevant . The Debate phases document how we got here (Regional drawers → faults in geography → Orders proposal → implementation & objections) .

**Protocol 7.3 — how to cite a clip.** Each slip is built from **clips** (verbatim or close), labeled with a local **Slip Code**, **Provenance** (Region + record form), the **clip** itself, **Order tag(s)**, and a **1–3 sentence commentary** .

**Architecture as method.** In the Capital, **apertures** literally throttle knowledge: round **windows** allow slips but not bodies, and **stairs** meter crowds—filed under **Mediation & Aperture**  .

**Temperaments you’ll overhear.**

* **Clerkly** archivists love stamps and tolerances; distrust metaphysics.
* **Romantic** archivists narrativize, caring for witness voices.
* **Philosophical** archivists legislate categories and systems .
  Expect these voices in margin notes and cross-refs.

**Keep contradictions.** Do **not** reconcile conflicting testimony; disagreement is evidence and may itself determine the Order tag (e.g., **Boundary** or **Doubling**) .

---

## 3) Field atlas — the Regions at a glance (what they *do*, with flagship materials)

### Capital — Bureaucratic center; licensing and control

* **Apertures govern truth flow.** Windows limit passage to slips; stairs slow bodies—“knowledge may pass; bodies may not” (Order: **Mediation & Aperture**)  .
* **How to cite a clip** lives in Capital protocols; use the Slip/Provenance/Clip/Orders/Commentary template in every slip .

### Dens / Densmok — Edges, speech, and devices under constraint

* **Boundary town(s).** Dens is both town and wilderness; the line **moves with the hour** (Order: **Boundary**)  .
* **Densmok devices & “plot.”** Night-work scenes tie code to breath; devices define what counts as a plot (“two with closed eyes… **a plot is the intersection of their stares**”) (Orders: **Mediation & Aperture**, cross **Doubling/Craving**)   .

### Quarry / Yeller Quarry — Sources, journeys, fivefold images

* **Doubles with no origin.** Castelia’s **Hunt** woodcuts produce “fivefold silhouettes” whose **burrs** and **wrists** don’t line up; the market wants a single first cut, the slips refuse it (Order: **Doubling**)  .
* **Roads that bud**. Quarry journeys **proliferate** paths; each road **throws another** (Order: **Doubling**) .

### North Town / Northo — Murder songs & secret lives

* **Murder songs index.** Public melodies double as **private confessions**; “missionary is the killer” appears in margins (Order: **Violence & Secret Life**)  .
* **Pickbox cart (Northo file).** A cart “not larger than a wheelbarrow” opens into rooms; **five women** rope behind; who bears the burden is unresolved (cross-Region, cross-Order case)  .

### Tower of Mirado / Sticks — Catechism drills and withdrawal

* **Edges-to-edges (Tower).** Repetition makes **technique**; a rule enters the hand as speech recedes (Order: **Silence & Withdrawal**) .
* **Sticks quiet-hours.** Clinic boards, router sheets, and moderators’ notes reveal **silence as method** under surveillance pressure (Order: **Silence & Withdrawal**)  .

### Dead River — Counting systems, towns made by maps

* **A town named by a map.** With “no river… no speech,” the **map** installs the town; “from that map, another… and from that one, ten” (Orders: **Mediation & Aperture** + **Doubling**) .
* **Transit by device.** A **canistered flame** enables passage: **devices** make routes, not geography (Order: **Mediation & Aperture**) .
* **Craving taught on the street.** Handouts and a TV/comic franchise train appetites and launder harm (Orders: **Craving**, **Violence & Secret Life**, **Mediation & Aperture**)  .

### Capeast — Festival sites and women’s arrival stories

* **Pattern log (G2).** The mapmaker’s women arrive “ahead of the mapmaker,” clothing variants provoke **protests**; the paperwork tries to catch a moving seam (Orders: **Silence & Withdrawal**/**Boundary**)  .

---

## 4) Recurring devices & plots (your story-making toolbox)

* **The Pickbox Cart.** A traveling aperture “opening inside into rooms upon rooms,” shadowed by five women—perennially misfiled by Region, correctly seen as device-first (Orders: **Mediation & Aperture**; cross **Violence & Secret Life / Doubling**)  .
* **The Map that Makes a Town.** Dead River exists **because a map names it**; maps beget maps (Orders: **Mediation & Aperture**, **Doubling**) .
* **Yeller’s Fivefold.** Castelia’s silhouette and North’s “yeller stanza” are a **code** tying number to harm and desire (Orders: **Violence & Secret Life**, cross **Doubling**)  .
* **Edges to Edges.** The Tower drill and Sticks quiet-hours show how **language becomes habit**, then falls silent (Order: **Silence & Withdrawal**)  .
* **Capital Apertures.** Windows/stairs as **filters**: the city’s truth is throttled by openings and tolerances (Order: **Mediation & Aperture**) .

---

## 5) Characters and figures (as the Archive understands them)

* **The Mapmaker** — pulls the pickbox cart; sleeps while **five women** watch; routes touch Northo, North, Dead River, Capeast. The cart is **authorless burden** (debated); the women sometimes **precede the story** the records try to write  .
* **The Five Women** — walk “as one though they were five”; clothing patterns vary and trigger official **protests**; agency misread as offense (Orders: **Boundary**, **Silence & Withdrawal**, cross **Violence & Secret Life**)  .
* **Castelia** — artist of the **Hunt** woodcuts; provenance splinters into burrs, inks, copies (Order: **Doubling**) .
* **The Minor Archivist** — Capital clerk whose notes teach **aperture logic** (“I speak through the window”) (Order: **Mediation & Aperture**) .
* **Cassie, E., Ria** — Mirado Sticks “withdrawal” cases; each exhibits silence as method with differing complications (Order: **Silence & Withdrawal**) .
* **Queenmater (handouts)** — a street device teaching **Craving** in Dead River; also a forum flashpoint in Sticks logs  .
* **Varro & Kettel** — Debate voices: Varro formalizes Orders-first; Kettel warns metaphysics shapes speech. Their quarrel explains your slip’s **Orders-first** duty with **Region** as provenance  .

---

## 6) Orders → Examples (how to think like a filer)

* **Boundary** — Dens/Densmok stories where **town ↔ wilderness** keep trading places; Tower drills that draw a line then make it move  .
* **Doubling** — Quarry **roads** that bud; **fivefold** images and stanzas; **maps-of-maps** that install a site without origin   .
* **Craving** — Devices and markets that **teach appetite** (Dead River handouts/TV; Quarry commutes)  .
* **Silence & Withdrawal** — **Quiet-hours** and **catechisms** where hands keep the rule after speech stops  .
* **Violence & Secret Life** — North murder songs, **public melody / private confession**; Yeller’s **respectable commute** → **secret appetite**  .
* **Mediation & Aperture** — **Windows**, **carts**, **canistered fire**, **plot machines**: forms that **let truth pass** while holding bodies back   .

---

## 7) How to write your first slip (in character, step by step)

1. **Pick a thread** (ore → clip candidates). Example:

   * Densmok **plot** device lines (Stell/Frank scene) .
   * Quarry **fivefold** woodcut findings (burr lines; pose variance) .
   * Tower **“edges to edges”** catechism notes (child self-prompt) .

2. **Decide the Order (primary)** → then mark **Region (secondary)** using the canonical lists above .

3. **Pull 2–5 clips** and format with Protocol 7.3 (Slip Code; Provenance; `|| clip ||`; Orders; Commentary). **Keep contradictions** in view; they’re evidence  .

4. **Write the three sections** in order—**Provenance → Extract → Archivist’s Commentary**—arguing **why the Order fits** (not just the Region). Good models:
   **A1/A2** (Capital windows/stairs), **D1/D2** (Quarry doubles), **I1** (Sticks withdrawal) .

5. **Optional cross-index** one Debate doc that frames your choice (e.g., “Edges to Edges”; “Map Without River”)—but remember, the Archive is the shelf; Debate is history .

6. **Filename & front matter.**
   `[order]-[region]-[descriptive-slug]-[code].md` with the standard Archive **entry format** and layout `archive`  .

---

## 8) Ten quick seed prompts (copy, then find 2–3 clips)

* **Boundary · Densmok** — “Two kinds of story about Dens” vs ditch-readers’ ledgers → the edge moves; keep both accounts .
* **Doubling · Quarry** — “Roads that bud”: pull one colloquy minute + one junior registrar note; show **proliferation** .
* **Craving · Dead River** — Queenmater handouts + TV/comic **franchise**; docket “dose” as practice  .
* **Silence & Withdrawal · Sticks** — Router sheet spike + quiet-hours note; “speech after hands”  .
* **Violence & Secret Life · North** — Murder song index + “missionary” margin: melody ledger vs confession ledger .
* **Mediation & Aperture · Capital** — The Senate **stairs** + inspection tolerances; crowd-throttling as filing tool .
* **Mediation & Aperture · Northo/Dead River** — Pickbox **cart** + canistered **fire**; the device makes the journey possible  .
* **Doubling · Yeller Quarry/North** — “Yeller” stanza + **Hunt** woodcut: fivefold code across song and image  .
* **Boundary · Tower** — “Edges to edges” lesson plan + transfer to cutlery; a line that changes what it bounds .
* **Silence & Withdrawal · Capeast** — Clothing **pattern log** + protests; ordinance tries to catch agency .

---

## 9) Mini-glossary (the Archive’s sense of the terms)

* **Aperture** — Any device or opening that **permits slips** but denies bodies; more broadly, any mechanism that **makes a site legible** (Capital windows; pickbox cart; Dead River map)  .
* **Fivefold** — A number that travels through songs, silhouettes, and routes; usually **recurrence without origin** (hence **Doubling**)  .
* **Quiet-hours** — Sticks practice of putting **hands before words**; surveillance changes tempo, so silence is **re-marked** at dawn .
* **Provenance vs Order.** Provenance is where a record comes from; **Order** is what it **does**. Orders are primary; Regions are secondary—by policy and by hard-won argument in the Debate  .

---

## 10) Submission sanity-check

* ✅ **Order first; Region second** (with cross-index if the device crosses towns) .
* ✅ **Clips follow Protocol 7.3** (Slip/Provenance/Clip/Orders/Commentary) .
* ✅ **Contradictions preserved** (mark, don’t fix) .
* ✅ **Voice stays archivist-in-character** (analytical, fragment-preserving) .

---

### Appendix — Canonical lists (quick copy)

* **Orders:** Boundary; Doubling; Craving; Silence & Withdrawal; Violence & Secret Life; Mediation & Aperture .
* **Regions:** Capital; Dens/Densmok; Quarry; North Town/Northo; Tower/Sticks; Dead River; Capeast .

> You’re ready. Pick a device, pick a ledger, pick a seam—then file what it **does**.

## File: ./GRAD-STUDENT-WORKFLOW.md

# Graduate Student Workflow — Writing **Archive** Slips (Orders-first)

> You’re contributing **in-character** documents to the Capital Archive. Read the Archive **GRAD-STUDENT-CONTEXT** first for the historian’s overview and the Archive’s method; then use this step-by-step to produce your slip. Archive files by **Order (primary)**, with **Region (secondary)** as provenance  .

---

## 0) What belongs here (and tone)

* **This section is for slips**: primary documents compiled by Capital archivists, written **in character**, fragment-preserving, interpretive, and deliberately unresolved .
* Keep the Archive/Debate boundary straight: you may **cite** Debate for context, but you’re filing **Archive** evidence, not writing Debate minutes .
* Voice & house style: precise, clerkly-professional; preserve contradictions rather than reconciling them .

---

## 1) Choose your **source thread** (“ore”)

Pick one thread that the context file highlights (examples below). You’ll mine it for **verbatim clips**:

* **Capital/Apertures** (window tolerances; stairs as throttles) → Mediation & Aperture .
* **Dens / Densmok** (edge that won’t hold; plot device) → Boundary / Mediation & Aperture (often cross-tags) .
* **Yeller Quarry** (roads that bud; Hunt woodcuts) → Doubling .
* **North / Northo** (murder songs; pickbox cart) → Violence & Secret Life (cross Mediation & Aperture) .
* **Tower / Sticks** (catechism; quiet-hours) → Silence & Withdrawal .
* **Dead River** (map installs a town; carried flame) → Mediation & Aperture + Doubling .

> Rule of thumb: your **unit of truth is a clip** (verbatim or near-verbatim) that you bracket and comment, not a paraphrase. Protocol follows in Step 4.

---

## 2) Classify **Order first → Region second**

Use the Orders as working lenses to decide **what the slip *does***; Regions record **where** it came from:

* **Orders (primary):** Boundary; Doubling; Craving; Silence & Withdrawal; Violence & Secret Life; Mediation & Aperture .
* **Regions (secondary):** Capital; Dens/Densmok; Quarry; North/Northo; Tower/Sticks; Dead River; Capeast .

Why this order? Densworld shows **device before place**—maps make towns, windows make policy, carts make rooms—so we shelve by what a document **performs** (the Order) and only then mark provenance (the Region) .

---

## 3) Sketch your slip (3 sections, always in this order)

1. **Provenance** (Region · record form)
2. **Extract** (2–5 clips)
3. **Archivist’s Commentary** (1–3 sentences per clip set)

Keep conflicts intact; disagreement is **evidence** (it can even determine the Order, e.g., Boundary/Doubling) . Your commentary argues the **Order-first** reasoning, not just geography .

---

## 4) Cite clips by **Protocol 7.3** (required)

Use the Archive’s in-house protocol when you quote:

**How to cite a clip (Protocol 7.3)**

* **Slip Code** — local identifier (e.g., A1)
* **Provenance** — Region + record form (e.g., Capital · Licensing Notes)
* **Quotation Mark** — bracket excerpts with `|| … ||`
* **Cross-Order Tag** — primary Order (+ optional cross-tag)
* **Commentary Line** — 1–3 sentences on how the clip pressures the Orders .

**Template + mini example**

```
Slip: [CODE] — [TITLE]
Provenance: [REGION] · [FORM]
Clip: || [VERBATIM EXCERPT] ||
Order(s): [ORDER-1][; ORDER-2]
Commentary: [ARCHIVIST NOTE, 1–3 sentences]
```



---

## 5) File naming & front matter

**Filename pattern** (Order-primary):
`[order]-[region]-[descriptive-slug]-[code].md` (e.g., `mediation-capital-window-aperture-a1.md`) .

**Front matter** (use the Archive entry format + `layout: archive`):

```yaml
---
title: "Archive Post A1 — Capital: Window Aperture, South Arcade (caliper check log)"
order: "Mediation & Aperture"
region: "Capital"
catalog_code: "A1"
excerpt: "This window is not a door. The rule is design: knowledge may pass; bodies may not."
layout: archive
---
```

(adapted from A1/A2 examples) .

---

## 6) Cross-index smartly

* Add a **cross-Order** tag when your clips clearly operate in two realities (e.g., Mediation & Aperture **cross** Doubling for the pickbox cart) .
* **Optional:** mention one **Debate** doc in a footnote if it frames your filing (e.g., “On the Necessity of Cross-Indexing Densmok”), but keep the slip itself strictly Archive  .

---

## 7) Tone, temperaments, and what *not* to do

* Write as a **Capital archivist**; your job is to **measure pressures** and keep contradictions, not to solve them  .
* Expect (and avoid impersonating) institutional **temperaments** in the margins: **clerkly**, **romantic**, **philosophical**—they shape policy, not your prose .
* Don’t smuggle in **fictional narration**; your “story” is the arrangement of clips + commentary.

---

## 8) Build & test locally (quick dev loop)

* Serve the site (`bundle exec jekyll serve`), then load `…/archive/[order]-[region]-[slug]-[code]/` to verify front matter renders and links work. Your entry will appear under its **Order** in the Archive hub (and in the Region finder) automatically .

---

## 9) Worked micro-example (you can model your first slip on this)

**Filename:** `_archive/mediation-densmok-plot-aperture-b3.md`

```yaml
---
title: "Archive Post B3 — Densmok: Plot by Aperture (device scene & store notes)"
order: "Mediation & Aperture"
region: "Densmok"
catalog_code: "B3"
excerpt: "Two closed eyes make a plot; the device makes the truth pass, not the bodies."
layout: archive
---
```

**Provenance** — Densmok · Night-work at Softwares (storefront); coder scene; screen output note.
**Extract**

> || Two people with their eyes closed… **A plot is the intersection of their stares.** ||
> **Archivist’s Commentary** — The **form** makes the truth: a rule that **constrains bodies** so only a plotted **intersection** may pass. File **Mediation & Aperture**; cross-index A1 **Window Aperture** (Capital) for the same principle: **knowledge may pass; bodies may not**  .

---

## 10) Submission checklist (copy/paste and tick)

* ✅ **Order first; Region second** (cross-index if the device crosses towns) .
* ✅ **Clips follow Protocol 7.3** (Slip/Provenance/Clip/Orders/Commentary) .
* ✅ **Three sections** present (Provenance → Extract → Archivist’s Commentary) and the commentary argues **Order-first** .
* ✅ **Contradictions preserved** (mark, don’t fix) .
* ✅ **Filename & front matter** match Archive specs (Order-primary pattern; entry fields)  .

---

## Appendix — Quick classifiers (use while deciding your Order)

* **Boundary** — unstable edges; lines that move (e.g., Dens’s town/wilderness) .
* **Doubling** — replication without origin (e.g., Quarry roads that bud; Hunt “fivefold” images) .
* **Craving** — appetite as engine (e.g., Dead River handouts/TV/comic franchise) .
* **Silence & Withdrawal** — method installed then voiced recedes (Tower catechism; Sticks quiet-hours) .
* **Violence & Secret Life** — public ledger vs private harm (North murder songs) .
* **Mediation & Aperture** — devices/apertures making access (Capital window; pickbox cart; map that makes a town)  .

## Archivist's Commentary

The Capital makes architecture do the filing. The aperture governs what may cross (paper, not flesh);
the stairwell governs how fast. We shelve this under *Mediation & Aperture*: the city's truth is
throttled by its openings. The "minor" voice is not a confession but a measurement of pressure at the rim.

**Catalog Code:** A1

## Provenance

South Arcade Licensing Board: *Quarterly Caliper Inspections*, Annex II (signed by Registrar Tollo).
Supplementary spot-check memoranda from Senate-house perimeter inspectors regarding window rims and breach seals.

## Extract

> **1. Aperture Spec.** Face-window shall be circular; clear diameter not to exceed one-third cranial width of licensed archivist on duty. No door; no walk-in ingress. Exchange of slips only.
> 
> **2. Tolerance.** ±2 mm on interior rim; hairline fissures to be tar-inked and re-lacquered within 24 hours.
> 
> **3. Incidents Noted.** Two instances of grit-induced feed distortion ("static") during receipt of Quarry hunt sketches; one instance of Dens-residue on ledger paper; all remediated with double-lining and bristle-brush cleanse.
> 
> **4. Status.** PASS. Advisory: re-check lacquer before festival week.

## Archivist's Commentary

This window is not a door. The rule is design: knowledge may pass; bodies may not. The South Arcade
aperture keeps our trade in fragments clean—calipered, lacquered, measured to a tolerance that
flatters the Senate-house. Still, the world outside salts our ledgers: Quarry dust, Dens grit, the
odd smear that will not wash. We note the contaminations because they are the cost of testimony.
The Capital's method—clarity, separation, the round hole smaller than a skull—works until the slip
itself arrives with its own weather. Then we re-lacquer and file the weather with the text.

title: "Archive Post F1 — Dead River: The Counting-Five Cases (Miasto–Gunnr Dossier)"
order: "Mediation & Aperture"
region: "Dead River"
catalog_code: "F1"
excerpt: "The number draws the watcher as much as the watcher draws the number. Five appears first as a child's tap and ends as a silhouette for sale."
---

**Catalog Code:** F1

## Provenance

Collated from alley reports in Miasto (Quarry capital), two road-watch logs outside the gates,
and a series of northern depositions from Gunnr villages regarding a man with a pickbox cart.
Supplemented by trinket-trade notes on the fivefold hunt silhouette, filed for iconographic cross-check.

## Extract

> "He looked for girls… He watched for a counting tap… There was a number he was after. Five."
> 
> "Miasto… the man was a northerner… His pickbox cart waited outside… its hollows ready…"
> 
> "You will have heard of Yeller… the fivefold figure in silhouette…"

## Case Register — Counting-Five (selected)

| Site | Subject | Indicator | Cart Proximity | Disposition |
|------|---------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Miasto, alley corner | Girl (~5), barefoot, alone | Toe-tap in repeating five | Cart sighted outside north gate | Unresolved (observer breaks off) |
| Road out of Miasto | Unknown child (age unknown) | Shoulder jerk (1–1–2–1) | Cart odor (leather/boar) reported | Unconfirmed |
| Gunnr village edge | Two girls (7, 9) | Finger-count whispered "five" | Cart wheels heard past midnight | Family relocated; no follow-up |
| Quarry border shrine | Girl (~10) | Tap ceased at shrine lights | No cart; fivefold silhouette tokens sold nearby | Returned home |

## Archivist's Commentary

The number draws the watcher as much as the watcher draws the number. Five appears first as a child's
tap and ends as a silhouette for sale. Between those two ledgers—the road and the market—walks the cart
that opens inward. We record the misses alongside the sightings because absence also leaves a trail:
the odor on a road, the hush at a shrine, the family that packs by dawn. There is no arrest here, only
a pattern tightening. We keep the pattern for when someone asks who began it.

catalog_code: "F2"
excerpt: "The overlap is not a merger but a pressure point: Capeast pedagogy brushes the Dead River mythos and leaves a seam that later readers misname as origin."
---

**Catalog Code:** F2

## Provenance

Compiled from *Dead River* school folios ("5000s" set), Capeast sandbox memos referencing
Ria Levins's early work, and alley-shop ephemera linking Yeller silhouettes to Dead River routes.

## Extract

> || "One possibility is to make 5000s the only place where Ria's Dead River work and the Capeast School overlap…
> Maybe it's early work by Ria playing in the Densworld sandbox before doing her own thing." ||
> 
> || "You will have heard of Yeller… the fivefold figure in silhouette… how can a single fivefold being—
> five women-one being—maintain itself over generations?… Though what you might ask is whether the man in the
> pickbox cart might be himself some kind of immortal…" ||

## Archivist's Commentary

The overlap is not a merger but a pressure point: Capeast pedagogy brushes the Dead River mythos and
leaves a seam that later readers misname as origin. The fivefold Yeller and the pickbox man turn the
question of "continuity" inside out—are we tracking persons, or patterns? For the 5000s we file the overlap
as a rehearsal space where an artist's method (Levins) tests the market's silhouettes (Yeller) and the cart's
interior world (pickbox) without resolving who lasts. The dossier keeps the seam visible so later datings
don't harden into firsts.

**Catalog Code:** A3

## Provenance

Roadside and tavern testimonies from the **North Town/Northo** line; axle-repair ledger notes; North murder-song index; Dead River detour account (nested lids); contextual notes from the Archive’s traveling-device appendix. Cross-filed to prior slip **E2** (“Northo: The Mapmaker’s Pickbox”) and to Debate **Case Note 19.4** (“On the Pickbox Cart and Authorless Burden”).

## Extract

> || *The mapmaker stopped at a village once… a cart that seemed tiny, almost no larger than a wheelbarrow, but which opened up inside into a house or even a town. And they had heard of the five women who walked behind the cart, roped to the cart and walking as one woman though they were five.* ||&#x20;

> || *A man arrived with a cart not quite larger than a wheelbarrow yet opening inside into rooms upon rooms. Five women walked behind it as if roped though they were not… No one could agree on what made the cart so heavy, only that the man refused others’ food and the women refused his.* ||&#x20;

> || *We lifted the lid. Inside was a second cart, smaller. Inside that, another. At the fifth, we stopped. The lids did not close again.* ||&#x20;

> || *The cart rolled without him. It killed two girls. The song says: “pick, pick, pick,” but no name sings with it.* ||&#x20;

> || *The pickbox cart is a region unto itself—Gunnr-wood, bone, leather, corners beyond corners… Its operator listens for a count—specifically five—in a girl’s tapping; counting recruits; the burden encloses its own geography. In North Town, a murder song reports the cart rolling without him.* ||&#x20;

## Archivist’s Commentary

We file the **Pickbox** under **Mediation & Aperture** because each testimony treats the cart not as an object but as an **opening**: a burden that **permits contents** (rooms, tools, routes) while denying the body any clean authorship. The Northo witness reaches for measurement and fails—“not quite larger than a wheelbarrow,” then the sentence falls **inside** the box and returns as rooms and weight. The ledger wants a maker; the songs return only a **method** (“pick, pick, pick”). Where speech asks for a name, the cart **answers with a form**.&#x20;

Three recurrent seams warrant the drawer:

1. **Aperture before place.** As with the Capital’s windows and the map that makes Dead River, the cart **installs** a geography rather than inhabits one. The moment witnesses try to close the lid on provenance (“Northo cart”), the lid opens to **another cart**, and then another, until counting (five) becomes the only stable rule left. We have geography by device, not device by geography.&#x20;

2. **Authorless burden.** The song that reports “the cart rolled without him” strips the file of its last custodian. We are not filing a man’s possession; we are filing an **operation** that persists without a confessor. In this respect the cart rhymes with the Archive’s own frustration: devices travel; names do not hold.&#x20;

3. **Counting as gate.** Several records yoke the cart’s behavior to **five**—the number that already organizes Yeller’s figure and Dead River’s maintenance stories. The cart’s operator “listens for a count” to recruit; the detour book stops at the fifth lid; the songs in North keep five alive as menace and meter. In our schema that’s the pressure where **Doubling** (recurrence without origin) crosses the aperture, but the primary work remains **mediation**: a count that **admits**. &#x20;

4. **Silence, refusal, watch.** The women’s refusals (of food, of commentary) and their practiced **watch** place them on the threshold between **agency** and **ordinance**. Their step is “as one though they were five,” which the parish world reads as offense against clothing or decorum elsewhere; here, the offense is against provenance. They arrive **before** the story that can house them. We mark their watching as a form of custodianship the cart itself requires: a **quiet** that keeps the aperture from collapsing into a person.&#x20;

**Filing decision.**
Primary **Order:** *Mediation & Aperture*. Region tagged **Northo** (first stable witness) with cross-notes to **North Town** (murder-song behavior) and **Dead River** (nested lids). We preserve counts (“five”), refusals, and the absence of author as evidence, not defects.

**Methodological note.**
To insist on a single geography is to force the lid shut. In these slips the lid **will not close**. We recommend device-first shelving across the family of cart cases; where **Region** is demanded by policy, retain it as **provenance** and maintain cross-refs by **Order**.

## Provenance

Capeast harvest-festival incident file. Street-sweeper notes; bench-righting rota; three tavern

cross-notes to *Bare on Their Backs* apparel complaints.

## Extract

> The mapmaker's women arrived ahead of the mapmaker.

## Witness Ledger (selected)

| Witness | Locale | Observation | Action Logged |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| J. Marn (sweeper) | Square, south end | "Five of them, same step, no mapmaker. Backs marked in a bare ring." | None |

## Archivist's Commentary

Capeast is an after—after work, after city, after festival. We note how arrivals unsettle
the cleanup: five women, same step, no cart, no master, appetite held in reserve. Grievances
rise first to apparel and only then to agency, as if cloth were the hinge of consent. Our
file keeps what the night tried to smooth over: that the women arrived before the story did,
and the story—when it comes—will be forced to catch up to their pace.

**Catalog Code:** G2

## Provenance

Pattern log compiled after the Harvest Festival (Capeast Ward notes, Alley Watch intake);
appended parish protests and market-stall testimonies from the same night.

## Extract

> wherever the mapmaker journeyed." ||

## Archivist's Commentary

Capeast files spectacle as ordinance: the same step becomes a citation when cloth turns hinge.
The pattern log shows variety by design—self-chosen fittings—yet the protests read choice as threat,
converting arrival into a paperwork queue. We keep both ledgers: the shifting variants (agency in dress)
and the complaints (agency misread as offense). The women precede their story; the records lag behind,
trying to catch a moving seam with stationary rules.

**Catalog Code:** H2

## Provenance

Sticks · Web-archive export of a local forum ("Mirado Clinic board," Y22–Y23),
matched against router logs kept by a clinic aide; addendum from a volunteer moderator's
"quiet-hours" notebook (no-screens mornings).

## Extract

> **Router Sheet (02:13–02:27):** Spike on /queenmater thread; referrers: *former.io* mirror;
> *def.mil* crawler family seen in header. Three logins after midnight, two from alley Wi-Fi repeater. "E." removes embeds; thread switches to plain text.
> 
> **Forum Capture (mod screenshot, 02:31):** User *former_guest*: "We archive because the Sticks delete. Your 'withdrawals' prove the Tower model." Reply (clinic aide): "We don't 'delete'; we put speech after hands. Come back during quiet hours."
> 
> **Quiet-Hours Note (margin):** "Traffic is attention-shaped. When the crawler comes, the voices speed up, then stall. We re-mark silence at dawn and start loops again."

## Archivist's Commentary

The Sticks treat silence as a method, not a void: many returns begin with a broken screen and end in hand-work.
The forum shows how surveillance reorders tempo—posts accelerate at the glance of the crawler, then the
off-switch restores the local grammar where words go last and hands go first. We shelve this under
*Silence & Withdrawal*. (Cross-ref: Sticks withdrawal logs for Cassie, E., Ria.)

**Catalog Code:** I1

## Provenance

Sticks clinic intake cards; two "return-to-body" journals; roadside interviews with art students;
one Tower memo on Sticks non-compliance ("silence escalation"). Collected on the downstate routes.

## Extract

> A place like America not too long ago… but also a thousand years in the future.

## Withdrawal Register (selected)

| Case | Trigger | Method | Complication | Status |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|--------|
| MS-07 ("Cassie") | Screen blackouts / puzzle practice | No-speech mornings; walking loops; hand-work | Honesty collapse; "words snag" sensation | Maintains silence days; draws at night |
| MS-11 ("E.") | Clinic mandate | Cold-turkey from feeds; farm shifts | Dream bleed from Tower scripts | Relapses weekly; returns to field |
| MS-15 ("Ria") | Art school exit | Song without audience; long drives | Silence escalates to refusal | Non-compliant; status unknown |

## Archivist's Commentary

In the Sticks, truth is something you stop saying to see if it stays. Many returns begin with a
broken screen and end in hand-work: puzzles, drawing, walking a loop until the body remembers its
turn radius. We file the silence as a method, not a void. The Tower names this non-compliance; we
keep it as a local grammar where words go last and hands go first.

excerpt: "The Tower's drill makes speech lay the track for the hand—but the child's speech keeps laying tracks of its own."
---

**Catalog Code:** I2

## Provenance

Tower · Instructor lesson logs (Y18–Y21) and "anomalies register" slips from the Mirado schoolroom;
compiled after puzzle-catechism sessions ("edges to edges") with follow-up speech observations.

## Extract

> **Slip 4:** After nine repetitions of the puzzle rule, subject self-prompts correctly.
> In free talk, says: "Blue is baby," then clarifies by pointing to the mother's apron (blue gingham).
> Later in the week: "Apple means mother," used whenever lunch bell sounds. Instructor notes *register-shift*:
> rule language migrates into kinship talk.
> 
> **Slip 7:** Subject whispers "edges to edges" while aligning cutlery; when corrected to
> "spoons and spoons," replies: "Edges are for babies." Teacher remarks: *connotation drift*—the procedural
> phrase accrues age-value, then social value, without explicit instruction.
> 
> **Slip 11:** During picture transfer (pond → cabin), subject names the frame "home"
> and refuses "house," insisting: "Home is when the blue is on." (Apron absent that day.)

## Archivist's Commentary

The Tower's drill makes speech lay the track for the hand—but the child's speech keeps laying tracks of its own.
A procedural rule ("edges to edges") begets a private lexicon where colors pick up kinship, and steps on a puzzle
board appear as steps toward a person. We file this under *Silence & Withdrawal* to keep it beside
the catechism notes: repetition builds fit; fit spills into meaning.

layout: archive
---

**Catalog Code:** H3

## Provenance

Tower of Mirado · Family trip notes surrounding the Lincoln Memorial Garden dedication; phone-call fragments about a prepared speech; later family retellings that preserve a Jensen line as doctrine (Springfield, IL; Meg/Josh/Esther/Harriet chain).

## Extract

> || Mom was saying words at the dedication. ||

> || She’d sent ten or more copies of her three minute speech to Meg and called her so much about it that whenever her phone rang Josh had started whispering in the background, a bit too loudly to be safe, “Four score and fourteen years ago, my mother, my dear daughter’s grandmother, Harriet Knudson, brought forth, with the help of – God bless him – the most famous landscaper nobody’s heard of, a garden in Springfield. A garden for Mr. Lincoln. A garden...” ||

> || So, instead of watching the time or leaning on the speedometer, she let the radio think for her and arrived at the garden with five minutes to spare. ||

> || Meg had fallen for Josh because he’d known the difference between redbuds and dogwoods. ||

> || …convincing world famous landscape architect Jens Jensen to drive down from Chicago and design what he later called “the only garden to truly embody my deepest principles,” ||


## Archivist’s Commentary

The day installs a method. A public **program** (copies of a three-minute speech; “Mom was saying words at the dedication”) is present in the ledgers, but the content itself does not survive in this packet. The record leaves a bracketed interval where the ceremony should be; what remains in force are the **habits** the day affirms: arriving to a tempo (“let the radio think”), then walking and naming—**redbuds / dogwoods**—until the garden’s rule lives in the hand (and eye). In the Tower, we file this under **Silence & Withdrawal**: speech **lays the track** and then **withdraws**, leaving practice to carry it forward . The Jensen sentence persists not as oratory but as doctrine—an articulated principle that the paths remember.

Cross-index (light): **Boundary**—a garden as a managed edge between design and wild; keep the tension rather than resolve it (see Tower drills where a line both bounds and moves) .

> 
> **Card 2 (stall behind the mill):** || Lines on scalp like letters or tracks. Paid for a cog with a ring from a child's toy. Refused stew; asked for wire. ||

## Archivist's Commentary

She arrives as a mechanic and leaves as a rumor. The cards disagree on her marks (letters or tracks),
agree on her refusals (food, talk). We file under *Violence & Secret Life* for the shaved head
and the tool that hushes speech, cross-listed to *Mediation & Aperture* for the way she tunes a wheel
like a window—letting force through, not bodies. The contradictions are the sighting.

---

**Catalog Code:** E1

## Provenance

Lane-collector spools from the North road (wax & aluminum, mixed quality); stool-transcripts from taverns
between Gee Road and the Quarry line; two parish songbooks (loose-leaf, weather damage). Compiled by the
North Desk, with cross-notes to the Northo "Lives" folio and three depositions referencing the mapmaker's cart.

## Extract

> "Singers show up, come from North Town more than any other borough. Why? Murder songs."
> 
> "The principle of North Town is living a secret life — serial killer only being one of the more obvious variety."

## Index — First Lines & Recording Notes

| First Line (as sung) | Locale | Source | Notes |
|---------------------|--------|--------|-------|
| *I washed my hands in the creek named After* | North road tavern, mile 11 | wax cylinder (late) | Voice doubled at refrain; second singer off-mic, suspected "pairing" echo |
| *He borrowed my name for a Sunday* | Schoolhouse porch, Old Gee Spur | aluminum disc | Child descant on verse 3; parish book lacks this stanza |
| *Bring me the knife with the churchyard handle* | Market lane, North Town proper | stool transcript | Witness swears singer smiled only on the word *handle* |
| *We took the road that won't be seen* | Bridge by the mill, dusk | wax cylinder (damaged) | Low mechanical hum underneath; mapmaker's cart reported upriver that night |
| *Mother sewed my shadow shut* | North gate steps | parish notebook | Margin hand: "*missionary is the killer*" (ink-blot, uncertain hand) |

## Archivist's Commentary

The singers carry two ledgers at once: melody for the square, confession for the alley. Many of the
North songs turn on a small instrument—knife, creek, borrowed name—then open a second life under the first,
where the "missionary" voice courts and conceals. Our task is not to decide who kills, only to preserve
the split. We file doubled takes beside clean ones, and keep the hums, because the hum is how the road
remembers who passed over it.

---

**Catalog Code:** E2

## Provenance

Axle repair entry from the village ledger (night watch signature smudged); tavern-boy's notes
recorded by the reeve; corroborating remarks from two men who shadowed the road toward Gee.

## Extract

> A man arrived with a cart not quite larger than a wheelbarrow yet opening inside into rooms upon rooms.
> Five women walked behind it as if roped though they were not. He slept a day and a night while they
> watched him. At dawn, with the new axle fitted, he pulled west again. No one could agree on what made
> the cart so heavy, only that the man refused others' food and the women refused his.

## Archivist's Commentary

The witnesses look for a single hand to carry the weight: the man, the women, the objects. The cart
answers by moving anyway. It drags its own world forward and speaks only in what it unfolds—rooms,
habits, distances—never in confession. We file intention last here. The burden is its own author;
the testimony is the only map we can draw.
