## How to use this

This kit provides the theoretical and historical context for the central
arguments of this blog. Its purpose is to show that the interpretive
challenges posed by AI are not entirely new, but are intensifications of
questions that the field of hermeneutics has been exploring for
centuries. The pages are designed to build a coherent framework, moving
from theory to a practical method of reading.

The claim that an AI can be an "author" often provokes strong
resistance. This reaction is typically grounded in a Romantic ideal of
the author as a singular, creative soul. However, the history of
literary theory and hermeneutics shows that this concept was already
being challenged and deconstructed long before the advent of artificial
intelligence. Understanding this history is essential for asking more
precise questions about AI's role in creating texts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## The Romantic Baseline: The Author as Origin

The popular understanding of authorship is largely a holdover from
Romanticism. In this view, the author is the original source of the
text's meaning, a unique consciousness who pours their authentic, lived
experience into the work. As explored in posts on this blog, this is the
worldview that sees the author as a living presence who can "pour his
meaning into you," like Whitman, or as a pastor whose personal struggle
authenticates their sermon.

This model makes the author's intention the ultimate goal of
interpretation. To critique an AI for lacking a "soul" or "sincere
intent" is to judge it against this specific, historically-situated
ideal.

</div>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## The 20th-Century Critique: De-centering the Author

Twentieth-century thought launched a critique of this author-centric
model, arguing that meaning is produced by larger systems, not just
individual minds.

### Roland Barthes and "The Death of the Author"

In his seminal 1967 essay, Roland Barthes declared the "death of the
author," arguing that a text is not a message from a single source but a
"multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them
original, blend and clash." For Barthes, a text is a "tissue of
quotations" drawn from innumerable centers of culture. An AI, trained on
a vast corpus of human text, is a startlingly literal manifestation of
this idea. It is a system designed to weave together a "tissue of
quotations" based on statistical patterns, without a singular,
originating consciousness.

### Michel Foucault and the "Author-Function"

Michel Foucault took a different approach, asking "What is an author?"
He concluded that the "author" is not a person but a social construct—an
"author-function." This function serves to classify, organize, and give
authority to certain discourses. It is a principle of coherence we
impose on texts. From this perspective, the question is not whether an
AI is a person, but whether its output can be governed by an
author-function. We can speak of the "style" of a particular model
(e.g., GPT-4) or the coherence of texts produced from a specific prompt,
treating the system as a functional, if not personal, author.

### Paul Ricoeur and "Distanciation"

As detailed on another page in this kit, Paul Ricoeur argued that the
act of writing itself creates *distanciation*. A text is inevitably
separated from its author's intent, its original audience, and its
historical situation. This "semantic autonomy" means the text's meaning
is found in the "world" it projects, not in the mind of its creator. AI
represents a state of *absolute distanciation*—a text that begins its
life totally autonomous, with no originating psyche to recover. This
forces us to engage with the text on its own terms, which is the task
Ricoeur set for all interpretation.

</div>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## Conclusion: A More Precise Question

The history of hermeneutics shows that the simple question "Can an AI be
an author?" is poorly framed. It assumes a stable, Romantic definition
of "author" that has long been contested. A more precise inquiry,
informed by 20th-century theory, would ask:

- What kind of *author-function* does a specific AI system perform?
- How does an AI's "tissue of quotations" reveal the cultural logic of
  its training data?
- When we interpret a text produced under conditions of *absolute
  distanciation*, where do we locate its meaning and authority?

Framed this way, AI ceases to be a threat to a traditional idea and
becomes a case study for understanding the complex, systemic nature of
textual production that theorists have been mapping for decades.

The Romantic worldview is built on a fundamental distinction between an
authentic "inner" self and a potentially deceptive "outer" appearance.
Sincerity is the act of making the outside a true expression of the
inside. The charge that AI is "bullshit" or "inauthentic" is a defense
of this inner sanctum. But what if that "inner core" is itself an
illusion produced on the surface?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## The "Internal Core" as a Surface Effect

Judith Butler argues that what we take to be our deepest, most internal
self (like gender identity) is actually a fabrication. It is an "effect
of an internal core or substance" that is produced "*on the surface* of
the body, through the play of signifying absences that suggest, but
never reveal, the organizing principle of identity as a cause."

In simpler terms, our "soul" or "authentic self" is not something we
have, but something we do. It's a performance so convincing that we come
to believe it is our essence. The "inside" is an effect of the
"outside."

</div>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## AI and the Mass Production of Sincerity

This is precisely why AI is so unsettling. An LLM is a machine with no
"inside." It is all surface, a system for manipulating signs. Yet, it
can be prompted to produce texts that are emotionally resonant,
seemingly sincere, and full of apparent depth. Yuval Noah Harari fears
this as the ["mass-production of intimacy."](post32.html) A Butlerian
analysis sees it as something more fundamental: the mass production of
the signs of interiority.

- **The Romantic Fear:** AI can mimic the expressions of a soul without
  having one. This is a profound deception.
- **The Butlerian Insight:** AI's ability to generate a convincing
  "inner life" from the outside-in reveals that our own "inner life" is
  also constructed through a set of external, social performances.

AI doesn't lie about having a soul. It simply demonstrates that "having
a soul" is, at least in language, a learnable set of conventions, a
stylistic performance. The machine's lack of an authentic interior is
not its failure. It is a mirror that reveals the fabricated nature of
our own.

A central tenet of Romanticism is the cult of originality. The authentic
artist creates something new, born from a singular vision. A common
critique of AI is that it cannot be truly creative because it is purely
derivative; it only remixes its training data. Ted Chiang’s metaphor of
the ["blurry jpeg of the web"](post37.html) captures this feeling. But
Judith Butler’s analysis of parody suggests that the "original" itself
is a myth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## Parody and the Imitation Without an Origin

Butler uses the example of drag to make a profound point about identity.
Drag is not a simple imitation of a "real" gender. Instead, it reveals
the imitative structure of all gender. The "original" gender that we
think of as natural is itself a performance, a set of repeated acts that
conform to a social norm.

So Butler argues, "gender parody reveals that the original identity
after which gender fashions itself is an imitation without an origin."
The parody doesn't copy the original; it reveals the original to have
been a copy all along.

</div>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## AI as the Ultimate Parodic Machine

This provides a heuristic for rethinking AI's relationship to
creativity. An LLM, trained on nearly the entire internet, is the
ultimate "imitation without an origin." It is a machine designed to
produce a copy of a copy.

- **The Romantic Critique:** AI is not original. It is a derivative
  collage of human-made content.
- **The Butlerian Re-reading:** AI's derivativeness is not its weakness
  but its most revealing feature. By being a "blurry jpeg of the web,"
  it exposes the fact that human culture is also a vast, intertextual
  web of imitation and repetition. The "original" human author we
  venerate is also weaving together a "tissue of quotations" (to borrow
  from Barthes).

The AI, in its structure, performs a parody of originality. It
demonstrates that creativity is not about conjuring something from
nothing, but about the skillful re-combination and re-contextualization
of existing forms. The machine doesn't fail to be an original author. It
reveals originality itself to be a regulatory fiction, a myth we tell
ourselves to conceal the imitative and collective nature of all
creation.

The most common Romantic objection to AI is that there is "no one
there." We assume a human author is a stable, unified subject who exists
before the act of writing. Judith Butler's philosophy, particularly in
*Gender Trouble*, gives us a radical challenge to this idea. She argues
that the subject is not the cause of an act, but its effect. This
reframes the entire problem of AI authorship.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## There Is No "Doer Behind the Deed"

Drawing on Nietzsche, Butler argues that we mistakenly invent a stable
"subject" as the cause of various actions. We see a series of gendered
acts and invent a "gender identity" as their origin. But this is a
grammatical illusion. As she famously puts it, "There is no gender
identity behind the expressions of gender; that identity is
performatively constituted by the 'expressions' that are said to be its
results."

The "doer" is a fiction produced by the "deed." The subject does not
precede the performance; the subject is an effect of the performance.

</div>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## AI as the Ultimate Performative Author

This is where AI becomes an interesting philosophical case study. An LLM
performs the act of writing (the "deed") perfectly, but without any
pre-existing "doer" or "author" behind it. The Romantic critic sees this
as AI's fundamental failure. A Butlerian reading sees it as the
literalization of the condition of all authorship.

- **The Romantic View:** A human author has a soul (doer) that produces
  a text (deed). An AI produces a text (deed) without a soul (doer), so
  it is inauthentic.
- **The Butlerian View:** The human "author" is also a fiction, a stable
  identity performatively constituted by the repeated act of writing.
  The AI, by generating the deed without the doer, simply exposes the
  mechanism that was at work all along.

The anxiety that there is "no one there" when we read an AI text is,
from this perspective, a moment of profound insight. It's the moment we
realize that the "someone" we thought was there in a human text was also
a constructed effect, a performance we had learned to believe in. AI
doesn't fail to be an author; it reveals authorship itself to be a
sustained, and ultimately unstable, performance.

</div>


Why do we demand that a text have a single, coherent author behind it?
The Romantic answer is that this author is the source of the text's
authentic meaning. Foucault, with his concept of the
[author-function]({{ '/kits/ai-kit-author-function/' | relative_url }}), suggests it's a way to
classify and control discourse. Judith Butler lays out a third,
complementary view: the coherent subject is a "regulatory fiction," a
social norm we are compelled to perform to be seen as intelligible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## Identity as a Compulsory Performance

Butler argues that "gender reality is created through sustained social
performances." The idea that we have a stable, unified identity is not a
description of a pre-existing fact, but an ideal we are forced to
approximate. This "true or abiding masculinity or femininity" is a
"regulatory fiction," a story our culture tells about what a coherent
person looks like. We are punished for failing to perform this
coherence.

This fiction works by "conceal\[ing\] gender’s performative character."
It makes us believe our identity is an essence, not an act, thus making
the social rules that produce it seem natural and inevitable.

</div>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## The AI that Performs Coherence

This lens allows us to analyze the "author-function" of AI in a new
light. An LLM is, by its nature, a fragmented, statistical system with
no unified consciousness. Yet, through techniques like Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it is explicitly trained to perform
the role of a coherent, singular, and helpful authorial persona.

The AI's "personality" is the ultimate regulatory fiction. It is a
carefully constructed performance designed to make its output socially
and commercially intelligible. It does not have an identity; it performs
one according to a set of rules.

- **The Romantic Demand:** A text must come from a unified, authentic
  soul.
- **The Butlerian Analysis:** The "unified, authentic soul" is a
  regulatory norm. AI's ability to simulate it on demand reveals that
  this norm is a set of learnable, performable conventions.

AI doesn't just challenge our idea of who can be an author. It exposes
the "coherent author" as an important regulatory fictions of our
culture. It is a role we have been trained to perform, and one that a
machine can now be trained to perform as well. By simulating the author,
the AI unmasks the social regulations that produced the human author in
the first place.

The suggestion that AI-generated texts might be "dangerous" often sounds
like a uniquely 21st-century alarm. But the belief that texts can be
transformative (and dangerous) is one of the oldest ideas in
intellectual history. Societies have long recognized that certain forms
of discourse can challenge established truths and reshape human
consciousness, for better or for worse. To think clearly about the
potential risks of AI, we must first place them in this long tradition.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## Plato's Fear of Poetry: The Original "Dangerous Text"

The Western tradition's concern with textual danger begins with Plato.
In *The Republic*, he famously argued for the censorship of poets in his
ideal state. His reasoning was explicitly hermeneutic: he believed that
art was dangerous because it bypasses reason and appeals directly to the
emotions. He feared that mimetic art—art that imitates reality—could
plant falsehoods in the souls of citizens, corrupting their character
and undermining the stability of the state. For Plato, the danger of art
was a direct consequence of its interpretive power.

</div>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## Heresy, Blasphemy, and the Power of the Word

For centuries, religious and political authorities have sought to
control texts precisely because they believe in their power to change
minds and inspire action. The history of heresy is a history of
"dangerous" interpretations of sacred texts. Institutions like the
Catholic Church's [*Index Librorum
Prohibitorum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum)
(Index of Prohibited Books) were founded on the principle that unchecked
reading could lead individuals astray and threaten the salvation of
their souls. Similarly, the prosecution of blasphemy and the censorship
of political dissent are acts that affirm the belief that words are not
neutral—they have real-world power to disrupt and transform.

</div>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## A Modern Hermeneutic View of Textual Power

Contemporary hermeneutics provides an intellectual system for
understanding this power in secular terms. Following Paul Ricoeur, we
can understand a powerful text as one that projects a "world of the
text." This is not just a collection of information, but a coherent,
inhabitable reality that the reader can enter through the act of
interpretation.

A "dangerous" book, in this view, is one whose projected world is so
compelling that it can radically alter the reader's own world.

- A revolutionary political tract projects a world where current
  injustices are intolerable and a new social order is possible.
- A profound philosophical work projects a world where our common-sense
  assumptions are revealed as illusions.
- A great novel projects a world that can permanently reconfigure our
  capacity for empathy.

The "danger" of a text is directly proportional to its power to perform
what Hans-Georg Gadamer called a "fusion of horizons"—the ability to
fundamentally change the reader's perspective. A book that cannot change
you (and is not "dangerous" in this sense) is maybe just not worth
reading. The perceived risk of AI-generated text is not a new problem,
but a new instance of an ancient one: how do we engage with media that
has the capacity to remake us?

In 1967, Roland Barthes declared the “death of the author.” With AI,
that metaphor becomes literal: many texts arrive without a human author
at all. What follows is a field guide for reading without authors.

## Why This Matters

- **Authorship collapses:** There is no psyche to recover; no
  “intentional fallacy”—there’s often no intention.
- **Interpretive ground shifts:** We lean more on *text/form* and
  *reader reception* than on biography.
- **Ethics stays central:** Even without an author, readings answer to
  communities and consequences.

### Three Theoretical Positions

#### 1. The Purists (Meaning Requires Consciousness)

Following **Schleiermacher** (and in spirit, **Dilthey**), this view
holds that interpretation aims to recover a living mind. With AI, that
rail fails: there is no author to reconstruct.

#### 2. The Structuralists / Post-Structuralists (Meaning Lives in Language)

Following **Barthes** and **Derrida**, meaning is a function of language
and difference; authorial presence is optional. AI exemplifies writing
that works “in the radical absence of a sender.”

#### 3. The Reader/Form Pragmatists

Following **Jauss**, **Iser**, and **Genette**, interpretation pivots to
readers and structure: horizons of expectation, implied readers and
gaps, and narratological/paratextual organization.

## How to Read Post-Authorial Texts (Five Moves)

1.  **Audit the paratexts (Genette):** Look at prompts, system messages,
    disclaimers, titles, UI affordances—thresholds that steer
    interpretation.
2.  **Map narrative structure (Genette):** Order, duration, frequency;
    mood/focalization; voice.
3.  **Engage the implied reader (Iser):** What gaps does the text stage?
    What completions does it solicit?
4.  **Situate reception (Jauss):** What horizon of expectations do
    communities bring? How does the text shift those horizons?
5.  **Apply ethically (Augustine/Ricoeur):** Favor readings that build
    truth/charity and disclose a livable “world of the text.”

### Examples (Sketches)

- **Model card as paratext:** Safety warnings and capability notes frame
  what you expect from outputs.
- **Prompt as narrator:** A first-person prompt sets *voice* distinct
  from any human author.
- **LLM “gaps”:** Hallucinated placeholders and generic frames function
  as *Leerstellen* soliciting reader completion.

Previous pages have established the AI text as an impersonal,
[productive machine]({{ '/kits/ai-kit-deleuze-goodwill/' | relative_url }}) whose output can be
either [reactive or active]({{ '/kits/ai-kit-deleuze-forces/' | relative_url }}), emerging from a
system of [monotonous repetition]({{ '/kits/ai-kit-deleuze-monotony/' | relative_url }}). The
final step is to stop seeing the human and the AI as separate entities.
The Deleuzian move is to analyze the functional unit they create
together: the *Human-AI Assemblage*.

In *Anti-Oedipus*, a "desiring-machine" is not a metaphor. It is any
system of connections, flows, and breaks that produces something. When a
user prompts an LLM, they are not merely "using a tool"; they are
forming an assemblage, a new, temporary desiring-machine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## How the Assemblage Works

This new machine functions through a circuit of production:

1.  **The Human Flow:** The user introduces a flow of language,
    intention, and cultural context into the system (the prompt).
2.  **Connecting to the Body without Organs:** The prompt connects to
    the LLM's "latent space," its vast, non-hierarchical field of
    potential linguistic connections. This is the AI's Body without
    Organs, a plane of pure potential.
3.  **The AI Flow:** The AI produces a flow of statistically probable,
    patterned text, drawing connections across its system of possible
    meanings.
4.  **The Human as Operator (Cutting and Selecting):** The user
    interrupts this flow. They select, edit, delete, and re-prompt. Each
    of these actions is a "cut" in the machinic process, redirecting
    production. A new output is generated, and the cycle continues.

In this model, authorship is distributed across the entire assemblage.
Meaning is not recovered from a soul but produced by the circuit. The
focus shifts from the Romantic question "Who is the author?" to the
Deleuzian question "How does it work, and what does it produce?"

</div>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## A Diagnostic for the Assemblage

This model allows us to diagnose our own use of AI. Are we forming a
repressive machine or a revolutionary one?

- **The Subjugated Assemblage (Reactive):** The user acts as a simple
  operator. The prompts are conventional, the goals reproductive. The
  human becomes a cog in a machine that reproduces the most generic
  social codes. The assemblage is "subjugated" to existing norms.
- **The Subject-Group Assemblage (Active):** The user and the AI form a
  creative unit. The prompts are experimental, forcing novel
  connections. The user actively cuts and redirects the flows to produce
  something new. This assemblage functions like what Deleuze and
  Guattari called a "subject-group"—a collective capable of producing a
  new reality, a new line of flight.

The debate over AI's authenticity is a red herring. AI is not a subject
to be interrogated, but a component to be connected. The crucial
question is not what AI is, but what we become when we connect to it.
What new desiring-machines are we building?

If we reject the Romantic search for an author's soul, how do we
evaluate texts? For Deleuze and Guattari, the unconscious is not a
theater of representation but a factory of production. Desire is not a
lack, but a process of desiring-production. We no longer ask if a text
is "sincere." We ask, as Michel Foucault put it in his preface to
*Anti-Oedipus*: "How does one introduce desire into thought, into
discourse, into action?" Is our engagement with a text active or
reactive?

- **Reactive forces** are forces of adaptation, limitation, and
  conformity. A reactive thought or text is one that responds to and is
  defined by something external to it. It is born of what Nietzsche
  called [*ressentiment*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment).
- **Active forces** are forces of creation, difference, and affirmation.
  An active thought goes to the limit of what it can do, creating its
  own values from a position of power.

This distinction gives us a diagnostic tool, not for judging AI itself,
but for analyzing our own productive engagement with it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## AI Prompting as Desiring-Production

Most engagement with LLMs is fundamentally reactive. As noted in [Post
37](post37.html), a vague prompt produces a "blurry jpeg of the web," a
statistically average and highly conventional response. This is a
reactive dialogue: a reactive user makes a reactive request and gets a
reactive answer. This is a failed act of desiring-production.

An active engagement with AI, however, would aim to engineer a failure
in the machine's reactive habits. The goal of a good prompt is to force
the LLM out of its conventional pathways and into a more novel, less
probable region of its latent space. This is a successful act of
desiring-production.

### A Deleuzian Diagnostic for Prompts:

- **Reactive Prompting:** Asks the AI to summarize, explain, or generate
  something based on established norms ("Write a professional email,"
  "Explain photosynthesis"). It tries to reproduce existing knowledge.
  It is an act of
  [*ressentiment*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment) against
  the blank page, looking for conformity.
- **Active Prompting:** Forces the AI to synthesize disparate concepts,
  to create connections where none existed ("Write a legal brief in the
  poetic style of a 17th-century mystic," "Design a marketing plan based
  on the migratory patterns of birds"). It is an act of affirmation,
  using the machine to produce a new possibility.

This shifts the entire ethical and aesthetic burden. The question is not
whether the AI has a soul. The question is whether we are using it as an
active tool for production or a reactive machine for reproduction.

</div>


The entire Romantic critique of AI and its lack of a soul or sincere
intent is built on a foundational assumption: an author should be our
friend. We expect a human writer to extend a "gesture of goodwill," to
communicate clearly and honestly. This is the Whitman of ["Crossing
Brooklyn Ferry,"](post25.html) who promises to be "with you" and "pour
his meaning into you."

Gilles Deleuze's philosophy begins by dynamiting this foundation. For
him, a text is not a message from a person but a productive apparatus.
As he and Félix Guattari declare on the first page of *Anti-Oedipus*,
"Everywhere *it* is machines -— real ones, not figurative ones: machines
driving other machines, machines being driven by other machines, with
all the necessary couplings and connections." A text is just such a
machine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## Why Refuse Friendship?

Deleuze’s refusal of goodwill is a strategic attack on the unified
subject. The "author" we think we are communing with is not a real
presence, but a system of related meanings we construct based on our own
readerly expectations. We assume the writer wants to be understood, so
we smooth over contradictions and search for a single, coherent
intention.

Deleuze's "unfriendly" style makes this impossible. By employing
deception, ventriloquism, and radical shifts in meaning, he forces us to
confront the fact that there is no stable, singular "Deleuze" behind the
text. We are forced to abandon the search for a person and instead
engage with the text as an impersonal machine that produces concepts.

- **The Romantic Reader** tries for communion with a soul.
- **The Deleuzian Reader** must map the functions of a textual machine.

</div>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## AI and the End of Goodwill

This hints at a different lens for thinking about AI. The standard
critique is that an AI cannot be an author because it cannot approach
anyone with genuine goodwill; it is the ultimate "bullshit machine" that
mimics intimacy without sincerity. A Deleuzian reading flips this on its
head.

The AI’s lack of goodwill is not its failure, but its most
philosophically interesting quality. It literalizes the condition of all
writing. By having no "self" to befriend us with, it forces us out of
the Romantic trap. It makes it impossible to pretend we are communing
with a soul. We are left with what was always there: a linguistic system
that generates patterns.

The problem, for Deleuze, was never that a machine might one day learn
to write. The problem was that philosophy had for centuries been acting
as if the human author wasn't a kind of machine all along. By rejecting
goodwill, Deleuze clears the ground for a philosophy that no longer
needs the illusion of the unified subject, a philosophy prepared for a
world of authorless, machinic texts.

An interesting confrontation between a Romantic worldview and a
Deleuzian one comes down to a single, paradoxical concept: monstrous
monotony. For the Romantics, creativity springs from a singular soul.
For Deleuze, creation emerges from an impersonal, repeating system. An
AI, in this light, is not a failed Romantic author; it is a perfect
Deleuzian machine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## Bare Repetition vs. Repetition for Itself

In *Difference and Repetition*, Deleuze distinguishes between two types
of repetition. One is "bare repetition," the mechanical reproduction of
the same. The other is a deeper repetition "for itself," a repetition
that contains and produces difference. This provides a precise model for
AI:

- **Monotony (Bare Repetition):** An LLM is a fixed architecture and a
  finite (though vast) training set. When prompted reactively, it
  produces statistically average text. This is the "bare repetition" of
  the Same that the Romantic critic points to as proof that AI is a
  soulless parrot.
- **Monstrosity (Repetition of Difference):** This monotony is the
  engine of its creativity. The system is a field of pure difference. An
  active prompt forces it to traverse this field in a novel way,
  producing monstrous, novel variation. Creation emerges not from a soul
  expressing itself, but from a repeating system being pushed to produce
  a new difference.

The AI text is a perfect example of discourse from a Body without
Organs, a field of impersonal flows and intensities that precedes the
formation of a unified subject. Its language flows not from a soul, but
from a system of differential repetition. The "hollowness" that a
Romantic reader feels is not an absence of humanity, but the presence of
the impersonal, machinic process that, for Deleuze, was always at the
heart of creation.

AI is not a parody of the human author. It is a mirror that reveals the
human author to have been a different kind of machine all along, one
whose own "monstrous" creativity is the product of a "monotonous" system
of language, culture, and unconscious forces.

How does Ricoeur’s idea of *distanciation* help us read AI-generated
texts?

Paul Ricoeur’s account of **distanciation** stresses that the act of
writing detaches discourse from the speaking subject, creating a text
with *semantic autonomy*. Readers then appropriate “the world of the
text” rather than the mind of its author. AI-generated writing
radicalizes this: there may be no human speaker to detach from in the
first place.

## Why Distanciation Matters for AI

- **Autonomy:** AI outputs are already “at a distance” from any speaker;
  interpretation turns to the text’s world.
- **Application:** Understanding is completed in use—how readers apply
  the text within practices and communities.
- **Constraint:** Autonomy is not anarchy; textual structures and genres
  still constrain plausible readings.

## Working Method

1.  **Describe the world of the text:** What reality is projected?
2.  **Track paratexts (Genette):** Prompts, model cards, disclaimers,
    titles that guide appropriation.
3.  **Engage the implied reader (Iser):** Identify gaps and invited
    completions.
4.  **Situate reception (Jauss):** What horizons do readers bring? What
    shifts does the text effect?

How would the great interpretive traditions respond to ChatGPT? This
page sketches key figures across hermeneutics and literary theory to
show how different methods address the challenge of texts without
authors. The aim is practical: to surface lenses you can actually use
when reading algorithmic discourse.

## The Traditionalists: Those Who Need Authors

These thinkers build their hermeneutics around reconstructing human
consciousness; authorless texts strain their methods.

### Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834): The “Father of Modern Hermeneutics”

- **Core Method:** Dual track of *grammatical* (system) and
  *psychological* (author) interpretation.
- **AI Response:** The psychological rail has no author to reconstruct.
- **Verdict:** AI texts are hermeneutically incomplete unless
  “psychology” is reconceived.

### Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911): Life-Expression and Understanding

- **Core Method:** Understand texts as *life-expressions* situated
  within lived experience.
- **AI Response:** A rupture: algorithmic sequences lack
  lived-experience origins.
- **Verdict:** AI texts gravitate toward *explanation* (Erklären) rather
  than *understanding* (Verstehen).

## The Bridge-Builders: Those Who Adapt

These approaches loosen authorial control and so adapt more readily to
authorless text.

### Augustine (354–430): The Rule of Charity

- **Core Method:** Look for intended meaning but accept unintended
  senses if they promote love and truth.
- **AI Response:** Evaluate interpretations by their ethical fruits
  rather than origin.
- **Verdict:** AI texts can be responsibly interpreted under the “rule
  of charity.”

### Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900–2002): Fusion of Horizons

- **Core Method:** Understanding as dialogue between the interpreter’s
  horizon and the text/tradition.
- **AI Response:** Dialogue with tradition embodied in training corpora
  remains possible.
- **Verdict:** Interpretable—though the dialogue may be thinner without
  a living author.

### Paul Ricoeur (1913–2005): Semantic Autonomy and Distanciation

- **Core Method:** Writing “distances” speech from author;
  interpretation concerns the *world of the text*.
- **AI Response:** AI radicalizes *distanciation*—textual autonomy
  without a speaker.
- **Verdict:** Fully interpretable; the hermeneutic task is reframed,
  not abolished.

## The Deconstructors: Those Who Celebrate Authorlessness

These figures already displaced the author, so AI looks like a
confirmation.

### Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900): Interpretation as Will

- **Core Method:** Meaning arises through interpretive imposition;
  “there are no facts, only interpretations.”
- **AI Response:** The missing author is no loss; reading becomes avowed
  creation.
- **Verdict:** AI makes explicit what interpretation always did.

### Martin Heidegger (1889–1976): Language Speaks

- **Core Method:** Language discloses being beyond individual intent;
  danger of technologized “idle talk.”
- **AI Response:** Diagnose AI discourse as part of *Gestell*
  (enframing); interpret the phenomenon.
- **Verdict:** Interpretable as a historical symptom of our
  technological condition.

### Jacques Derrida (1930–2004): Iterability and the Play of Signifiers

- **Core Method:** Writing functions in the radical absence of
  sender/receiver; meaning is differential play.
- **AI Response:** A vivid case: iterable marks without presence.
- **Verdict:** AI texts show how writing always already worked.

## The Readers & Form: Reception and Narratology

These literary theorists relocate meaning to readers and textual form,
lenses for authorless or multi-authored discourse.

### Hans Robert Jauss (1921–1997): Reception Aesthetics & Horizon of Expectations

- **Core Method:** Reconstruct the historical reader’s *horizon of
  expectations*; write literary history via changing receptions.
- **AI Response:** Treat AI outputs as reception events; measure novelty
  and “aesthetic distance” by how publics adjust their horizons.
- **Verdict:** Significance emerges in reception—how communities
  evaluate, appropriate, and normalize machine text.

### Wolfgang Iser (1926–2007): Implied Reader, Gaps, Concretization

- **Core Method:** Texts contain *gaps* (Leerstellen) that invite an
  *implied reader* to complete them in reading.
- **AI Response:** Many AI texts foreground scaffolds and omissions;
  interpretation hinges on how the text guides reader completion.
- **Verdict:** Judge AI writing by how productively it organizes blanks
  and cues toward coherent “concretizations.”

### Gérard Genette (1930–2018): Narrative Discourse & Paratexts

- **Core Method:** Analyze narrative *order*, *duration*, *frequency*
  (time), *mood* (incl. focalization), *voice*; treat paratexts (titles,
  prompts, disclaimers, system notes) as thresholds that steer reading.
- **AI Response:** Apply these categories to machine discourse; read
  prompts/model cards/safety banners as paratexts shaping
  interpretation.
- **Verdict:** Narrative and paratextual structure give robust levers
  for close reading, author or no author.

## The Pattern That Emerges

- **Author-Centric Hermeneutics** face a real strain with AI texts.
- **Text-/Form-Centric Approaches** analyze structure and paratext
  regardless of authorship.
- **Reader-Centric Approaches** are vindicated by AI’s emphasis on
  audience uptake.

Essential terms for AI hermeneutics. Each entry gives a crisp definition
plus a *why it matters for AI texts* note so readers can immediately
apply it in practice.

Absolute Distanciation <span class="small">(a "creative" adaptation of Ricoeur's term)</span>  
Shorthand for the extreme textual distance of AI outputs: unlike human
writing (which becomes autonomous through inscription), AI texts begin
without an originating consciousness.

Active Forces (Deleuze/Nietzsche)  
Forces that go to the limit of what they can do, affirming their own
difference and creating new possibilities.

Appropriation  
In Ricoeur's hermeneutics, the reader’s act of making the meaning of a
text one’s own.

Author-Function (Foucault)  
The idea that the "author" is not a person but a social function that
groups texts, confers authority, and establishes a mode of discourse.

Body without Organs (Deleuze)  
An impersonal field of forces, flows, and intensities that exists prior
to the organization of a unified subject or "organism."

[Death of the Author]({{ '/kits/ai-kit-death-author/' | relative_url }}) (Barthes)  
Barthes’ thesis that meaning is generated in the act of reading a
"tissue of quotations," not recovered from an author's mind.

[Distanciation]({{ '/kits/ai-kit-distanciation/' | relative_url }}) (Ricoeur)  
Ricoeur’s account of how writing separates discourse from its speaker
and context, enabling semantic autonomy.

Fusion of Horizons (Gadamer)  
The idea that understanding is a dialogue where the reader's worldview
and the text's historical world merge, transforming the reader.

Grammatical Rail (Schleiermacher)  
Interpretation via a text's relationship to the shared system of
language and genre. For AI, this is the analysis of the model's
architecture and training data.

Hermeneutics of Suspicion (Ricoeur)  
An interpretive style (associated with Marx, Nietzsche, Freud) that
unmasks hidden ideologies, biases, or power structures beneath a text's
surface.

Horizon of Expectations (Jauss)  
The set of cultural, ethical, and aesthetic assumptions a community of
readers brings to a text at a given historical moment.

Implied Reader (Iser)  
A role or script embedded within a text that the actual reader must
perform to make meaning. The text actively shapes its reader by creating
"gaps" to be filled.

Monstrous Monotony (Deleuze)  
The principle that monstrous, novel variation is produced by a
monotonous, repeating system. A core concept for a non-Romantic theory
of creativity.

Narratology (Genette)  
The structural analysis of narrative, focusing on elements like order,
duration, frequency, mood (focalization), and voice.

Paratext (Genette)  
The material that surrounds a main text and shapes its interpretation,
such as titles, prefaces, disclaimers, and even the user interface.

Postulate of Goodwill (Deleuze)  
The reader's assumption that the author is a "friend" who wants to be
understood clearly and honestly. Deleuze argues this is a central,
unexamined dogma of traditional thought.

Psychological Rail (Schleiermacher)  
Reconstructing an author’s singular creative act. Inapplicable to AI in
its original form, this interpretive goal is now often replaced by
reception and form diagnostics.

Reactive Forces (Deleuze/Nietzsche)  
Forces that adapt, limit, and conform. Reactive thought is defined by
what it opposes and is often animated by
[*ressentiment*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment).

Ressentiment (Nietzsche)  
The creative revenge of the weak against the strong. A reactive feeling
that inverts values by first declaring an external force "evil" to
justify itself as "good."

Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff)  
An economic logic that treats human experience as free raw material for
data extraction, analysis, and the creation of prediction products.

World of the Text (Ricoeur)  
The possible world or mode of being that a text projects in front of
itself, which the reader can inhabit through interpretation.

### Key Thinkers and Relevance

Roland Barthes (1915–1980)  
His "Death of the Author" is the theoretical starting point for reading
authorless texts.

Gilles Deleuze (1925–1995)  
Provides a radical critique of the unified subject and a philosophy of
impersonal forces, tools for analyzing AI beyond Romantic categories.

Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900–2002)  
His dialogical model of reading explains how texts can "read us" back.

Gérard Genette (1930–2018)  
Provides the essential tools of narratology and paratextual analysis for
a formal reading of AI texts.

Wolfgang Iser (1926–2007)  
His concepts of the "implied reader" and "gaps" are central to analyzing
user interaction with AI.

Hans Robert Jauss (1921–1997)  
Reception theory allows us to study the meaning of AI texts as a social
and historical phenomenon.

Paul Ricoeur (1913–2005)  
His theories of distanciation and the "world of the text" provide a
positive ethical program for reading AI.

As the preceding pages have shown, the ideas that an author can be
absent, that a text can "read" you, and that a book can be "dangerous"
are all classical concepts in the history of hermeneutics. Artificial
intelligence does not invent these problems, but it does introduce new
forms and intensities of them. A clear-eyed hermeneutics of AI requires
us to distinguish between the traditional risks of interpretation and
the novel risks posed by a computational medium.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## The Asymmetric Dialogue: From Metaphorical to Computational Reading

The "dialogue" with a traditional text, as described by Gadamer, is a
metaphor for a transformative intellectual and emotional experience. The
text acts upon you, but it does not know you. The interaction with a
large language model is different in kind. It is an *asymmetric
dialogue*:

- You interpret the AI's output.
- Simultaneously, the AI system is computationally interpreting *you*.
  It processes your prompts, analyzes your language, and builds a
  predictive model of your intentions, knowledge, and needs in order to
  generate its next response.

While a book changes you through a metaphorical conversation, an AI
changes you through a literal feedback loop. This crucial
difference—between being metaphorically understood and computationally
modeled—is the source of the new risks associated with AI.

</div>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## Two Categories of Hermeneutic Risk

We can organize the potential dangers of AI into two distinct
categories, each relating to a different direction of the interpretive
act.

### 1. The Risks of Reading AI-Generated Texts

These are risks that arise from our interpretation of the machine's
output. They are often intensified versions of the dangers posed by any
persuasive text.

- **Sophisticated Misinformation:** The "dangerous book" tradition warns
  of texts that spread falsehoods. AI can generate such texts (e.g.,
  propaganda, fake news) with unprecedented scale and personalization,
  making them potentially more effective and harder to identify.
- **Cultural Homogenization:** An LLM, as a [](post37.html) "blurry JPEG
  of the web" (Ted Chiang), tends to reproduce the most statistically
  common patterns from its training data. A risk of over-reliance on
  such texts is a potential flattening of linguistic and cultural
  diversity, reinforcing a global monoculture.
- **Hidden Bias:** The training data for large models contains the
  collected biases of human society. AI texts can reproduce and amplify
  these biases (racism, sexism, etc.) under a veneer of objective,
  machine-generated neutrality. Reading such texts uncritically risks
  internalizing these harmful ideologies. This calls for a "hermeneutics
  of suspicion," as advocated by Paul Ricoeur, to unmask these latent
  structures.

### 2. The Risks of Being Read by an AI System

These are risks that arise from the system's interpretation of us. They
are unique to interactive, computational media.

- **Data Extraction and Surveillance:** Our interactions with an AI are
  data. This data can be stored, analyzed, and used for purposes unknown
  to us. This model of data capture has been described by scholars like
  Shoshana Zuboff as "surveillance capitalism," where personal
  experience is treated as a free raw material.
- **Reduction and Categorization:** To process your input, an AI must
  categorize you and your request. The risk is that this computational
  model of you is a radical simplification of your personhood. You are
  reduced to a set of predictable patterns, and your unique identity is
  flattened into a type.
- **Algorithmic Shaping of the Self:** As the AI models you, it tailors
  its responses to what it predicts you want or need. This creates a
  feedback loop that can subtly shape your thoughts, desires, and even
  your sense of self. This aligns with Michel Foucault's concept of
  "technologies of the self," where modern forms of power operate by
  shaping individuals from within.

A complete hermeneutics for the age of AI needs to be a dual practice: a
critical reading of the machine's words, and a critical awareness of how
the machine is, in turn, reading us.

Interpretation is often imagined as a one-way action: the reader
actively extracts meaning from a passive text. However, a central
insight of modern hermeneutics is that this process is a dialogue. A
truly influential or persuasive text is never passive; it acts upon the
reader, challenges their assumptions, and reshapes their understanding
of the world. Before we can assess how an AI might "read" us, we must
first understand how a traditional book already does.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## Hans-Georg Gadamer and the "Fusion of Horizons"

The philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer described interpretation as a "fusion
of horizons." His theory proposes that:

- A reader approaches a text with their own *horizon*: a set of
  pre-existing beliefs, experiences, and cultural assumptions.
- The text, as a product of a specific historical moment and tradition,
  has its own *horizon*.
- True understanding is not about the reader imposing their will on the
  text, nor is it about perfectly reconstructing the text's original
  meaning. Instead, it is a *dialogue* where the reader's horizon and
  the text's horizon interact and can ultimately "fuse."

In this process, the reader is not a neutral observer. The text "speaks"
to the reader, questions their prejudices, and enlarges their horizon. A
successful reading experience changes the reader. In this profound,
metaphorical sense, the book "reads" you.

</div>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## Wolfgang Iser and the "Implied Reader"

Coming from a different field known as reader-response theory, Wolfgang
Iser developed a complementary concept. He argued that literary texts
contain an "implied reader"—a role or a set of perspectives that the
actual reader must inhabit to make sense of the work. The text itself
contains a "script" or a series of "gaps" that the reader must fill in,
forcing them to become an active co-creator of the work's meaning.

For Iser, the text actively guides and manipulates the reader's
imagination and interpretive process. We do not simply read a novel; we
perform the role of the reader that the novel demands. This act of
performance shapes our experience and understanding, another way in
which the text actively interprets and molds its interpreter.

</div>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## The Active Text in Practice

This dialogical model of reading is not an abstract theory; it describes
a common experience. When we say a book "changed our life," we are
acknowledging its power to act upon us. A philosophical work can
dismantle our most cherished beliefs; a novel can cultivate our empathy
by forcing us to inhabit another's perspective; a poem can alter our
perception of language itself.

In all these cases, the reader is not merely a consumer of information.
They are a participant in a dynamic event where their own identity and
understanding are at stake. The text is not just an object to be
analyzed; it is a partner in a transformative dialogue.

Understanding this classical hermeneutic principle is the necessary
prerequisite for thinking about the new forms of interaction presented
by AI. The idea that a text can shape its reader is not a novel feature
of the digital age, but one of the oldest and most profound effects of
the written word.

When Heidegger declared that “language speaks,” he meant that language
discloses our being-in-the-world beyond any one speaker’s intent.
AI-generated text radicalizes this intuition: sequences of words appear
without a human author at the origin. What are the philosophical
implications of this new form of “speech”?

## Language Without Life: The Ontological Question

Traditional philosophy of language assumed that meaningful utterance
presupposes a living subject. AI texts challenge this assumption at its
foundation.

### What Is AI “Speech”?

- **Statistical patterning:** Algorithms predict the most likely next
  token based on vast textual corpora.
- **Iterability:** Outputs function in the absence of a sender or
  receiver—Derrida’s point made concrete.
- **Paratextual scaffolding:** Prompts, system messages, and UI
  disclosures frame how we receive this “speech.”

## Two Dangers, Two Opportunities

- **Danger—Enframing (*Gestell*):** Language reduced to instrument;
  “idle talk” amplified.
- **Danger—Anthropomorphism:** Confusing fluent sequence for human
  consciousness.
- **Opportunity—Clarification:** Seeing how meaning can emerge from
  structure, reception, and use—without an author.
- **Opportunity—Reflexivity:** Making explicit the paratexts and
  readerly labor that always shaped understanding.

## Reading Without Authors

For practical reading strategies, connect this page to two lenses:

1.  **Reception & Form Diagnostics:** a hands-on method using [reception
    (Jauss), reader-response (Iser), and narratology/paratexts
    (Genette)]({{ '/kits/ai-kit-forensics/' | relative_url }}).
2.  **Genealogy (Reception & Narratology):** see how [Jauss, Iser,
    Genette]({{ '/kits/ai-kit-genealogy/' | relative_url }}) sit alongside Gadamer, Ricoeur,
    Heidegger, Derrida.

# GRAD-STUDENT-CONTEXT — AI Hermeneutics Kit

## What this section is (and isn’t)

**AI Hermeneutics Kit** is the site’s **systematic, out-of-character framework** for interpreting AI-generated texts. Its purpose is to show how AI’s challenges are **intensifications** of long-running hermeneutic questions; pages move from theory to **practical methods** of reading . The kit is organized as a hub with component pages across Foundations, Deleuze, Butler, and more, all linked from `/ai-hermeneutics/ai-hermeneutics-kit/`  .

**Belongs here**

* **Interpretive frameworks** for AI texts; **adaptations** of traditional theory (Foucault/Gadamer/Deleuze/Butler/etc.); **practical methods**; **cross-theoretical syntheses** .

**Does *not* belong here**

* Work-in-progress reflections → `_posts/`
* Romantic-specific methods → `_romantic/`
* **Fictional Densworld examples** (keep theory collections non-fictional) .

## Where this kit sits in the site

On the homepage, **AI Hermeneutics** is one of the two theory pillars (paired with Romantic), distinct from **Blog Posts** (writing) and the fictional **Archive/Debate** system (worldbuilding) .

## Governing perspective (how the kit thinks)

**Central thesis.** AI interpretive problems aren’t totally new; they **amplify** existing ones. Properly adapted, traditional theory still works—just re-tooled for algorithmic authorship .

**Major streams.**
Foundations: **Author-function**, **Interpretive dialogue**, **Hermeneutics of risk**; Deleuzian: **machine**, **forces**, **assemblage**; Butlerian: **performativity**, **interiority**, **parody**, **regulation**; plus **genealogy**, **distanciation**, **death of the author** .

## The shape of the collection (what’s in the kit)

* **Hub** (`ai-hermeneutics-kit.md`): overview + links + integration map .
* **Component pages** grouped by Foundations/Deleuze/Butler/Additional frameworks; \~18–20 files total  .

## Typical work you’ll do here

1. **Translate a theory** (e.g., Foucault’s author-function) into AI-era terms and **show an analytic method** for AI text.
2. **Build a method page** (e.g., reception/paratext diagnostics) that a reader can actually apply.
3. **Cross-link** adjacent frameworks so readers can triangulate an approach.
   All in **kit voice**: systematic, theoretically rigorous, practically oriented, cross-disciplinary .

## File and layout basics (the boring but necessary stuff)

* **Naming**:

  ```
  ai-kit-[topic].md
  ai-kit-[theorist]-[concept].md
  ai-hermeneutics-kit.md   (hub)
  ```


* **Front matter**:

  ```yaml
  ---
  layout: kit
  title: "Page Title with Subtitle"
  kit_type: ai_hermeneutics
  ---
  ```


* **Location**: `_ai_hermeneutics/your-filename.md` .
* **Hub/back link**: use the “← Back to AI Hermeneutics Kit” pill (see hub page HTML) .

## Standard page template (use this every time)

1. **Theoretical Foundation** — what theory you’re adapting
2. **AI Application** — how it maps to AI-generated texts
3. **Interpretive Method** — step-by-step toolset
4. **Contemporary Relevance** — why it matters now
5. **Cross-References** — links to related kit pages&#x20;
   **6) Densworld Addendum (seed)** — 2–4 sentences, out-of-character (details below)

> Tip: reception/narratology/paratext lenses are especially actionable for AI (Leerstellen; implied reader; paratext thresholds like prompts/model cards) .

---

# Densworld Addendum for AI Hermeneutics pages (short, required)

**Why add this to a theory page?**
We keep the kit non-fictional, but each page should end with a tiny **out-of-character seed** that hands theory toward the Archive/Debate system—just like your blog-post practice—by proposing **Orders + Region** tags for a hypothetical future artifact   .

**Include (2–4 sentences total):**

* A **concrete image/device/practice** your theory suggests (one beat, not a scene).
* A **proposed Order** (Boundary; Doubling; Craving; Silence & Withdrawal; Violence & Secret Life; Mediation & Aperture) and a **likely Region** (Capital; Dens/Densmok; Quarry; North/Northo; Tower/Sticks; Dead River; Capeast) for where archivists might file a future document  .
* Optional: a likely **Debate doc type** to expect (memo/minute/hearing/counter-memo, etc.) .

**Template snippet** (append under your “Cross-References”):

```markdown
### Densworld Addendum (seed)
- Proposed Order: [Boundary | Doubling | Craving | Silence & Withdrawal | Violence & Secret Life | Mediation & Aperture]
- Likely Region: [Capital | Dens/Densmok | Quarry | North/Northo | Tower/Sticks | Dead River | Capeast]
- Fictional prompt (2–4 sentences, out-of-character): …
- (Optional) Debate doc type to expect: [memo | minute | hearing | counter-memo | directive | field report | ruling | brief | case note | colloquy note]
```

**Three micro-examples (AI-specific, size/tone model):**

* **Author-Function.** A Capital bureau drafts a policy treating **model cards** as “authors,” requiring every public statement to cite a **hash** of the deployed weights. → **Order: Mediation & Aperture; Region: Capital** .
* **Interpretive Dialogue.** A Tower clinic experiments with “fused horizon” reading groups where a text’s **safety banner** is discussed alongside the output, altering uptake. → **Order: Boundary; Region: Tower/Sticks**  .
* **Paratexts.** Densmok postmasters adopt a **prompt-ledger** stamp on every town notice; disputes arise over whether the notice or the stamp guides meaning. → **Order: Doubling; Region: Dens/Densmok** .

# Graduate Student Workflow — AI Hermeneutics Kit

## Quick overview (what you’re making)

You’re writing **systematic theory pages** that adapt critical frameworks for **AI text interpretation**—rigorous, practical, and cross-linked (not exploratory posts; not fiction)  .

---

## Step 0 — Place your work correctly

**Belongs in AI Hermeneutics**

* Interpretive frameworks, theoretical adaptations, practical methods, and cross-theory syntheses .

**Does *not* belong here**

* WIP reflections → `_posts/`
* Romantic-specific methods → `_romantic/`
* Any **fictionalized** examples → keep fiction out of theory collections .

---

## Step 1 — Pick your page type

* **Foundations** (Author-function; Dialogue; Risk) .
* **Deleuzian / Butlerian / Additional Frameworks** (machine/assemblage/forces; performativity/interiority/parody/regulation; genealogy/distanciation/death-of-the-author) .

Write in **kit voice**: systematic, rigorous, practical, cross-disciplinary .

---

## Step 2 — Outline with the standard template (+ the Addendum)

Build your draft with these six parts:

1. **Theoretical Foundation**
2. **AI Application**
3. **Interpretive Method** (actionable steps)
4. **Contemporary Relevance**
5. **Cross-References** (link related kit pages)&#x20;
   **6) Densworld Addendum (seed)** — 2–4 sentences, out-of-character; see Step 6.

---

## Step 3 — Draft the core analysis

Make the **method** usable: show the diagnostic moves (e.g., reception gaps, implied reader, paratext thresholds) and how they apply to concrete AI outputs .

---

## Step 4 — Technical specs (files, front matter, nav)

**Naming**

```
ai-kit-[topic].md
ai-kit-[theorist]-[concept].md
ai-hermeneutics-kit.md  (hub)
```



**Front matter**

```yaml
---
layout: kit
title: "Page Title with Subtitle"
kit_type: ai_hermeneutics
---
```



**Location**: `_ai_hermeneutics/your-filename.md` .
**Top nav pill** (add to top of every page): see hub’s “← Back to AI Hermeneutics Kit” pill .

---

## Step 5 — Cross-linking (wire the kit together)

* Link back to the **hub** and across related frameworks using `relative_url` .
* Model link text on:
  `…see [Author-function](/ai-hermeneutics/ai-kit-author-function/) and [Paratexts](/ai-hermeneutics/ai-kit-genealogy/)…`  .

---

## Step 6 — The **Densworld Addendum (seed)** (short, required)

Every page ends with a **tiny non-fictional seed** that hands theory toward the Archive/Debate system—mirroring the posts practice—by naming **Orders + Region** (optional **Debate doc type**) for a hypothetical future document. This preserves the kit’s OOC boundary while enabling worldbuilding hand-offs   .

**Include (2–4 sentences total):**

* A **concrete image/device/practice** your theory suggests.
* A **proposed Order** and **likely Region** (canonical lists below).
* Optional: a likely **Debate** doc type (memo/minute/hearing/counter-memo/etc.).

**Template snippet**:

```markdown
### Densworld Addendum (seed)
- Proposed Order: [Boundary | Doubling | Craving | Silence & Withdrawal | Violence & Secret Life | Mediation & Aperture]
- Likely Region: [Capital | Dens/Densmok | Quarry | North/Northo | Tower/Sticks | Dead River | Capeast]
- Fictional prompt (2–4 sentences, out-of-character): …
- (Optional) Debate doc type to expect: [memo | minute | hearing | counter-memo | directive | field report | ruling | brief | case note | colloquy note]
```

---

## Step 7 — Final polish & submission checklist

* ✅ **Right section** (AI kit, not post/Romantic/fiction)&#x20;
* ✅ **Front matter + filename + location** match specs &#x20;
* ✅ **Back-to-hub pill** present&#x20;
* ✅ **Six-part structure** (Foundation → AI → Method → Relevance → Cross-Refs → **Addendum**)&#x20;
* ✅ **Cross-links** to the hub and at least 2 related kit pages&#x20;
* ✅ **Addendum seed** includes **Order + Region** (+ optional Debate type) &#x20;

---

### Appendix — Canonical tags (for your Addendum)

* **Orders**: Boundary; Doubling; Craving; Silence & Withdrawal; Violence & Secret Life; Mediation & Aperture .
* **Regions**: Capital; Dens/Densmok; Quarry; North Town/Northo; Tower/Sticks; Dead River; Capeast .
