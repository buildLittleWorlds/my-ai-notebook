      <h2>53 Romanticism Was Never Naïve: A Defense in the Age of AI</h2>
      <p>This post opens the <em>Defense of Romanticism</em> series. Its central claim is that the common critiques of AI art and literature are marked by the trace of a misunderstood Romanticism. Critics often attack a caricature—a "Romanticism" of sentimental feelings and diary-like sincerity.</p>
      <p>This series argues for something different. True Romanticism was never naïve. It was a rigorous intellectual movement that built a powerful <strong>method</strong> for understanding texts, consciousness, and the very nature of meaning. That method, known as Romantic hermeneutics, is surprisingly robust—and it gives us the sharpest tools we have for analyzing the challenges of AI.</p>

      <h3>What This Series Will Do</h3>
      <p>This is not a nostalgic defense of the "human spark." It is a methodological argument that will do three things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Re-center the Method:</strong> We will show that Romantic interpretation is a disciplined, evidence-based practice of reading, not a subjective search for feelings. The "author," whether human or machine, is a <em>reconstructable practice</em> we can trace in the text.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide a Toolkit:</strong> We will not just theorize. The <a href="romantic-quick-kit.html"><strong>Romantic Quick Kit</strong></a> is the intellectual home base for this series. It contains the key concepts, a step-by-step method, and links to primary sources. Use it as your guide.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply the Method to AI:</strong> Each post in this series will use the toolkit to analyze the core problems of AI—from "bullshit" to "individuality"—demonstrating that the 200-year-old method is more relevant than ever.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>How to Read This Series</h3>
      <p>Start with the toolkit. The posts that follow are applications of its method. This series is an argument that the best way to understand our future with AI is to master the intellectual tools of the past.</p>
