TRANSCRIPT:

When the flush of a newborn sun fell first
on Eden's green and gold, Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched
with a stick in the mold; And the first rude sketch that the world had
seen was joy to his mighty heart, Till the Devil whispered behind the leaves:
"It's pretty, but is it Art?" I’ve been pretty bored by the AI Art debate
or conversation until very recently. I think AI Art marks an important rupture in our perception
and our appreciation of art, enough to call it a revolution. As you’ll see, this rupture
has existed for a long time, but AI Art will make this separation, if it hasn’t been
done already, unrepairable. In a nutshell, AI generated art consists of
prompting an artificial intelligence to make an image. From a database of an inimaginable
amount of images, it’ll produce several which will correspond more or less to your
prompt. Now that’s fun and all, but some concerns
have been raised. Questions about the ethical collection of data to feed these AIs, or the
ethics of using people’s artworks to feed this AI. What about companies using AI generated
images to replace the work of artists? What if the artist, who needs a wage and money
to live, is replaced by a cheap AI?  This last question might sound a bit ridiculous,
but works made by an artificial intelligence, at least digitally, can be indistinguishable
from works made by actual artists. What does that entail? What does it mean for
the future of artists  and art?  I obviously don’t have answers
to all these questions and the opinions I will share here may change eventually. Knowing
how contentious this subject is, I invite you to change my mind in the comment section
if you disagree. I’ll get some of the questions out of the
way rapidly: What about the ethics of data collection for
AI? Data collection online is not a problem specific to AI generated art. It’s a problem,
but I think the AI Art debate would still happen even if the data collection was completely
ethical. It’s deeper than that. What about the ethics of using the artworks
of artists to feed your AI? The history of art is the history of copying and making reiterations
of previous artworks. I would argue that human progress is the history of people building
upon the progress of their predecessors. The problem with using the work of artists
to create new artworks, which has been a common practice throughout history, is because AI
generated art is free, or very cheap, for corporations to use them. Artists who want
to be able to feed themselves now don’t only need to compete with other artists, but
with a cheap, instant AI who can produce any art in a fraction of a second. The question here is: Do we want to live in
a world where the job of artists is replaced by AI? Technology and automation have always been
an issue in terms of eliminating jobs. That’s what automation is designed to do. Automation is a good thing. Any society in
the history of humanity would gladly cheer for automation. Less necessary labour means
a better quality of life, right? Well, not under capitalism. For capitalism,
automation is a bad thing because if robots do our jobs, if they, for example, harvest
food for us, then how will we be able to afford food? It’s a paradox under capitalism: if
production is automated, then nobody will be able to afford these products because most
will be unemployed. Automation is a good thing if we assume that
the labour made by machines is going to be for the benefit of humanity, not for the profit
of the machine owners. But for art, there’s something different
about automation because we really want the human touch. Most criticism of AI art I found
online boiled down to a gut feeling of discomfort to the idea that machines could make artworks
indistinguishable from the ones humans make. Why does AI generated art provoke this fear?
I think we might be afraid that automized processes might make art less soulful, less
human. However, I’m not entirely convinced by that. Disney’s Alice in Wonderland was
hand painted frame-by frame. Nowadays, many animation techniques such as tweening or rigging
have computers do most of the heavy-lifting for animation, at least when compared to frame-by-frame.
One could say that animation lost a bit of its soul when it stopped being painted frame-by-frame,
but the issue wasn’t the introduction of computer software or semi-automation, which
became a tool for animators. The issue was that this tool became somewhat obligatory
because of the profit-motive, because of capitalism. Capitalism obviously has tremendous impact
on art and we tend to forget about that because of capitalist realism, or the notion that
we can’t imagine anything outside of capitalism. To best illustrate the impact of the profit-motive
on cinema, we can turn to George Lucas (for my younger audience, he’s behind Star Wars
and Indiana Jones). What makes art soulless isn’t the fact that
it’s generated by a machine, but the fact that it’s commodified. The worrying thing
about AI generated art is that corporations will use it and make art even more stale,
devoid of any innovation, of any soul. But that’s not new, that’s been happening
for years. For a system that supposedly encourages risks and innovation, capitalism has been
doing quite a terrible job culturally. Let’s stick to what sells and reproduce it, repackage
it and resell it as long as its profitable. But that’s not the only negative impact
capitalism has on culture. For artists who need to make money to survive, they need to
work for, usually, corporations. Many artists, just to afford living, just to justify their
existence, need to sell-out, need to make art they don’t necessarily like or necessarily
want to do. That makes for soulless art. Artificial Intelligence can be an incredible
tool for artists, but, under capitalism, it’ll become a requirement which, instead of enabling
new ways for artists to express themselves, might limit and stifle their creativity. Perhaps one day I’ll make a video on the
impacts of capitalism on art, but let’s get back to AI Art. The introduction of AI art sparked a conversation
about what art is. And to understand what art is, I’d like to quickly explore the
reasons why we make art. And, specifically, why would we make art in a world where artificial
intelligence can do it for us? I’ve been watching the Stalker directed
by Andrei Tarkovsky, written by the Strugatsky brothers, where a writer, as they take a break
in their journey, gives a monologue to a science professor: The writer not only positions humans at the
centre of art, he also argues that it’s our purpose to create art. And while he says
that all this technology is a crutch, I see it as a way of slowly liberating ourselves
from the necessity to labour for survival. The less we need to labour for survival, that
is to labour to feed and shelter ourselves, the more we can labour for personal and collective
growth, that is the more we can put work into creating art, into understanding and exploring
art. It might sound like a foreign idea today as
most people’s purpose in life becomes their jobs and most people’s appreciation and
understanding of art is the consumption of entertainment. You might see where I’m going with this
and you might not like it. Narrowing the definition of art is something very scary to many people.
Separating Art from Entertainment, or “high art” from “low art”, is an exercise
that can lead into elitist territory. However, I believe Ai Art forces us to narrow the definition
of art. That, to me, is the Ai Art revolution. Ai Art is going to increase our standards
as to what art is. From now on, there will be art and illustration. The conversation about the definition of art
has been sparked many times in the art world, perhaps most famously with Marcel Duchamps’
Fountain where Duchamps presented a urinal and claimed it to be art. He argued that,
by forcing us to treat this object as art, it became art the moment we engaged with it
as art. This object, without the artistic intent,
was not art. With the artistic intent, it became one of the most influential artworks
of the 20th century. One of my favourite terms coined by Duchamps
was “retinal art” or the idea that some artworks just appeal to the eye and nothing
more. He was quoted famously for saying: “I was interested in ideas – not merely in
visual products, I wanted to put painting once again at the service of the mind.” This distinction between the painting at the
service of the mind or the eye, the idea that culture is aimed at growth and not entertainment,
creates a divide, a divide exacerbated and confirmed by Ai Art. This divide brings me to think: Not every
drawing, not every painting, not every sculpture, not every picture, not every image is art.
The same way not every text is a novel, a poem, or art. The same way not every video
is cinema, or art. “It’s pretty, but is it art?” AI art is finally making many people realize
that art isn’t beauty. Something can be very beautiful, yet not be art. A sunset isn’t
art, though it can be beautiful. A tree isn’t art, though it can be beautiful. However,
these can become art if contextualized and conceptualized as art, as Duchamps once did
with a urinal. I think AI generated images are the same.
They can be beautiful images, but not art, because beauty is not enough anymore to make
an image art. You can paint a beautiful landscape, or a really cool-looking character, but if
it doesn’t create an engagement with an audience in any way aside from creating a
sense of beauty, if it acts as entertainment or just appeals to the eye, then, to me, I’m
more comfortable calling it illustration. Art requires something like a social conversation,
a broader reflection a deeper meaning or intention. This is why Scorsese calls Marvel movies “theme
parks” rather than cinema. I’m applying that to the visual arts, which is why I’m
ok with calling retinal art “illustration” rather than art. And as long as AI illustration can’t give
deeper meaning or engagement to an image, no matter how beautiful it is, it’ll remain
illustration. It’s pretty, but it isn’t art. If you make images just because they’re
beautiful or cool-looking, without deeper meaning or engagement, you’re making illustrations
which, by the way, isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I will enjoy a landscape painting which
doesn’t have any other meaning than “this is a cool landscape” the same way I’ll
enjoy a sunset, or a really nice tree. But, just like the sunset, I won’t consider it
art. However, if you want to make art, be thought-provoking, share an experience, contribute
to people’s understanding of the world, use an image as a tool of communication, not
merely as a tool of entertainment. As an artist, you have to think of the writer
in Tarkovsky’s Stalker. If our purpose is to make artworks, how can you fulfill that
purpose? Ask yourself, is it enough to appeal to the eye as would a tree, stars, mountains
or AI generated images. I don’t think it is - not anymore. Ai generated images is not the death of artists,
and even less so of art. It might be the death of illustration, or illustrators. Photography killed a whole industry of artists
once it became popular. People who drew products for advertisements, people who painted portraits,
etc. lost their jobs. However, photography also pushed artists into modernity, forcing
them to create new ways of expressing and interpreting the world around them, new ways
of engaging, and having others engage, with the world. AI art will force artists to stop
making art for the sake of making pretty or cool images. Ai art will force artists to
make specifically, precisely and authentically human artworks, artworks designed to be engaged
with, designed to contribute to a social conversation, designed to communicate. An artificial intelligence
can recreate beauty, but can’t recreate the thought, the meaning and the intent behind
an artwork. That, I hope, will lead us towards a wave of more thoughtful, meaningful and
intentional artworks.
