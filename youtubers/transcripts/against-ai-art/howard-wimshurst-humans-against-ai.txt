TRANSCRIPT:

AI art needs to stop and here's why we need to talk about AI art guys um believe me I don't want to talk about this subject I'm in the middle of production on my short film but this is one of those topics that I feel so strongly about that I feel like I have to say something I have to do something to help I'm witnessing an entire industry get taken advantage of here I'm an animator so why should I care about the problems which concept artists and illustrators are facing right now well I consider them to be like my close Neighbors on the left is me and my little animation house and then I'm looking over the fence at my neighbor in digital art space and I'm just seeing that there are people at his house with flamethrowers just selling the whole thing Ablaze the first thing I think is that's not fair and the second thing I think is how long will it take until those Flames reach my house and burn that house down as well so we're all Neighbors in this like the creative space these things can spread and they will spread because there's profit involved so I feel like I need to say something about it right now before the damage gets even worse and and just do what I can so I can sleep peacefully at night I'm not making the argument that AI generated images have nothing valuable to offer that AI generated images never look beautiful or thought provoking that AI is an inherently evil or bad thing research of AI cannot lead to Improvement in quality of life or that AI cannot potentially increase the prosperity for all people potentially or that AI is simple and and building an AI is easy I'm not trying to trivialize what AI developers have done here and this is not an existential debate on the use case of AI either we're getting too far ahead of ourselves when we talk about those existential problems we will try instead in this presentation to focus on the actual underlying issue with AI image generators so welcome to the greatest data and intellectual property theft ever conceived I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that there are other videos that explain the technology G very well if you're completely new to this but I will explain the theft the Crux of the issue here stability AI funds a non-profit AI research project now the only reason that lion 5B was allowed to be made is because they did so under the banner of non-profit research project then this commercial AI is trained on a massive online data set without permission of the image owners lion 5B stands for 5 billion it's actually 5.6 billion images and contained within that is millions at least probably billions of copyrighted images and private images stability AI wastes no time in this they quickly release these so-called tools that exploit the artist they used to train it and they even have a feature where you can name artists you can use an artist's name as kind of like a style filter the artists images are being directly used to replace them they also waste no time in swiftly introducing premium tier options for massive profit and valuations oh believe me they are profiting they are making a mint out of this and millions upon Millions is lost in artist revenue and where do you think that artist revenue is going it's going to these small AI companies a few hundred staff it's going into their pockets and into their valuations and it's coming from the art industry and this is happening daily I'm talking about Millions daily that's being sucked away from the artists I drink your milkshake I drink it up and I'm gonna get a little bit more into it I'm going to show you more evidence for this just in case you are watching this and you are on the fence about the whole issue and you're saying oh well you know both sides have a good points one side is clearly in the wrong here these are the big players right we've got mid Journey Dolly and stable diffusion and stability AI is one of the biggest sort of players behind behind the scenes that are pulling strings with this also called open AI I don't know if this was intentional but they've kind of splinted off into like stability AI open AI stable diffusion it's kind of confusing one of the things that that's kind of linking them is the massive data sets that they've been using the biggest one being lion 5B their biggest Innovation was finding a legal loophole which allowed them to steal from all artists past and present I don't even think it's a loophole here after doing all the research I think they legally cannot do this they should not be able to do this I think when this is examined closer I think it will be found that they have been breaking the law EU law and U.S law even if it is a loophole it's a very immoral loophole I think they need to roll back these models the damage to artists lives clients and industries and virtual spaces has been substantial and it's only just begun we're starting to feel it stealing from one group selling to another group and making a ton of money in the process you have this one group here the artists right now the artists are copyright owners not because of any kind of endowment that they have right but because of their contribution when you create an original image you get the copyright by default because you have contributed something new to society typically artists have a strong work ethic especially when you get to the top of echelon of artists people like Craig Mullins people like James Gurney James Jean as an illustrator like these people are in the top Echelon of Arts not because of some kind of endowment but because they worked really hard to get there they have a respect for the medium they have artistic opinions and creative agencies human digital artists have been the ones driving Innovation for centuries and they're the ones driving it now as well and they want basic boundaries to be respected AI image generators the ones that I named in the previous slide they take from this group and they sell to this group which is the prompters right notice how I didn't say give they would a lot of the time as give they're not giving they're selling to the prompters prompters have no copyright ownership because they haven't contributed anything sometimes you have a crossover it's rare but sometimes you have artists that are also become prompters and I think that they're a very confused group of people typically the prompter has no work ethic more really colorblind they have to be to ignore this problem or they are just ignorant I could see that some people just haven't looked into it very much and they see this tool and they see oh it's a cool tool right I I can use it unformed artistic opinions a lot of the time and here's an interesting point I just added on here they are being used by AI prompters are being used by AI to improve the AI they think they're using this tool the tool is using them AI is using them and they have a false sense of entitlement it's something that I will get into later with the uh this new um group of people that's popped up that I call the AI bro prompters you might call them or AI apologists I sometimes call them but here I've put them under prompter now we have a word for this when an entity comes along they take from one group and they sell to another group and that word is exploitation this is exploitation of an industry and of course AI prompters the people using AI of course they love this technology they have nothing to lose in this they are not the ones being robbed they're the ones getting all the free samples of these AI image generators right and they're getting to skip a lot of the more difficult steps the time consuming steps like rendering drawing sketching having an idea taking credit for the regenerated ideas spat out by the AI using other people's hard work for free I'm Gonna Keep On search circling back to that guys because that is the Crux of the issue here it's not just me that thinks this this is the problem according to chat gbt Yani putska actually put in the questions and got open ai's own chatbot system to talk about this and chat GPT appears to agree with what I'm saying right the chatbot says it's important to obtain their consent before proceeding if you are considering using an artist's images in this way it's important to respect their rights and ensure that you have obtained the necessary permission before proceeding here's another one not leading it down anyway because Yani said some people believe they are not really using the pictures but merely showing them to AI to learn so being devil's advocate here chap GPT disagrees and says this may have some consequences for artists who created the image for example if an AI system is being trained on an artist's images to generate similar images or hybrids this could potentially lead to the creation of new works that are based on artists original images these new works may be produced and distributed without the artist's permission or compensation it is therefore important to obtain the artist's permission yes before using their images in this way their own chat bot disagrees with them and agrees with me let's say we have these four groups here like like let's see what everyone's thinking how are people being deceived so you've got the prompters prompters can think that what they're getting is super original when it's actually not and they've just arrived on the art scene and they don't know a lot of artists they don't notice when something is a rip-off of a human artist of course they do know some artists some of the more mainstream artists they've heard of they try to replicate using the AI they put in the name of those artists and they've noticed that that kind of bumps up the quality of the results that they can get right makes sense professional artists that's dedicated their lives to it it you put in his name the AI uses that portfolio as a data set and it gets better results the AI can do this very well as it can copy and preserve images one-to-one with no error AI devs developers right they confess that they literally don't know what's going on in their own AI software so they feign ignorance they say well it's not up to me right the AI is going to do whatever it wants they try to use that as a way to hide from their responsibility but they are well aware of all the copyright and sensitive data that they laundered very intentional in that AI it's using the data at its disposal to make the user very happy right that's its goal the goal is just to do the best job it can right it's using its data crunching ability to narrow down its sources to only professional art and photography because that gets it better results from people it gets it better feedback look it's noticing what the prompters are asking for and it's also notice missing the images that are selected in that multiple choice interface at the end so over time it uses the user feedback to narrow down the data set to only beautiful professional grade images the copyright images of the data set are doing all of the heavy lifting in these AI generated images that makes sense right so when people say well you know it's it's just one image and a sea of five billion well I'm pretty sure that Craig Mullins Greg Rakowski one of these professional artists their artwork is getting used way way more people calling them out by name human artists can clearly see their own artwork and the artwork of their peers being plagiarized and misused human artists are the most able to recognize what the AI is doing because of their Education and Research into Visual Arts and yet they are constantly being dismissed you can listen to Ahmad mustak the CEO of stability ai go through a full interview a sits down talks about the technology he doesn't mention artists once he never brings up artists I will be making memes uh throughout this video uh it's such a dark topic it's such a dark period of time for artists that like I couldn't actually get through making this without making a few memes hopefully it will make this easier to digest so the law I've told you they're kind of breaking the law the law is slow to catch up you know if we think of like progress societal progress as going from left to right we've got morality and ethics kind of leading the way and law is is just trailing behind trying to catch up right that makes sense given the the bureaucracy and the amount of time it comes along with bureaucracy here's where AI art is it's nestled neatly between you know this highly unethical AI art definitely not keeping up with morality and ethics for the time being it is ahead of the law it hasn't brought anyone to trial it hasn't called anyone into question there you have it we we must take action though right we cannot just sit by on the sidelines okay and and watch them get away with this I just I won't do it like my my soul my spirit doesn't allow it so we've got three things here legal recourse public awareness and holding social media accountable I'm gonna go into this this is not just whinging and us coming together to commiserate and to mourn the loss of our medium no we've got things we need to do this is our to-do list guys number one legal recourse I'm gonna link you in the description you can visit it at the end if you don't want this video to be interrupted these are two fundraisers one's called protecting artists from AI Technologies the other one similar name helped protect our art and data from AI companies the top one is in the US it's um closer to being funded it has a larger funding goal and it has more eyes on it has more publicity a smaller one in the EU I suggest you read all the information that's on these pages and donate to whichever one you want I've already donated to the protecting artists from AI Technologies by the concept art Association this is for the American one so it's in dollars the other fundraiser I suggest which is help protect our art and data from AI companies an Italian comic book Association they are going to bring this to Brussels to the EU courts in Brussels and and basically represent artists I think it's a really good cause so I'm going to show you how to donate and I'm also going to demonstrate it for you so click donate now very simple enter your donation so I have read um all of the information about this and uh I've been thinking about it for a while and I've decided to put a thousand Euros into this I think it's a very worthwhile course so uh let's put that in I put the tip amount to zero I'm gonna use PayPal for it I don't think you need to select a team member there I will do this part off screen for security and we see it loading thank you for your donation receipt has been sent to my email great okay and I'm going to copy the link and I'm going to put that in the description of this video for you to check out to read this is good okay I'm gonna post a comment maybe I'll copy it first I donated to both of them but I donated more to the EU campaign because they are further away from their funding goal and they have less publicity at this point the US and the EU are the two legal hot spots in the world where I think this issue needs to be brought to the highest Powers it needs to be addressed okay public awareness we need to inform the public just ordinary everyday people that AI image generators in their current state are highly unethical people need to know that not everyone does in fact very few people are aware of that they see it as being harmless Right image generators are highly unethical like the companies behind them but it's also using and consuming Arts from image generators is problematic it is unethical in a similar way where you wouldn't buy and use trainers that you know had been made in a sweatshop with child labor right we need to get better at holding our ground in stupid arguments with AI Bros and prompters because I see them winning Sometimes using these just very shallow tactics they manage to convince people we need to win that war because guys morality and ethics is on our side for this number three we need to make irresponsible AI art a taboo that's more of a general one we need to make a fuss when artists are exploited like this we need to speak up first of all I would recommend that we stop using these weak arguments that I find I think you know the ones these arguments that are like drawing attention to the artifacting AI can't even draw hands AI images all look bad you see these are really easy arguments to undo to unravel if you say it can't even draw hands well what are you going to say Well when it improves when it actually is able to draw hands AI images all look bad okay then why do you care if if it's using stolen data sets of course the problem is that AI image images do look good and they look good because they are using stolen artwork I know let's just like appreciate them for a moment here let's just let's pay our tributes to these memes they are funny we're gonna have to stop using them I told you that the morality is on our side right so what we find a lot of the time is that like Pro AI rhetoric with these Ai apologists and these AI Bros they can't actually use these with a straight face like they can't tell you with a straight face that it's morally defensible or that it helps the artist's Community or that people love AI art like the public have been calling out for air we need air it's the thing that we need like no one asked for this no one needed it artists love this tool artists have been just begging for AI art as a tool that they can use and that it removes the tedious task of creative work do we love making things everyone loves making things removing the creative part of image making to where it's just like a multiple choice selection screen you can't tell me that that's better so they can't use these so they resort to these weaker arguments right they take refuge in these kind of nihilistic arguments you know they'll tell you it's not technically illegal and they'll tell you that it's a cruel world and you've just got to keep up you know they resort to nihilism they say it's pointless to resist technological progress and there are critics systems to all of these points I will get into them in more depth in the coming slides when they can't win a fair argument what we found is they start gaslighting they start questioning your sanity they start questioning your emotional stability you're in the denial stage of grief oh I just love it when someone tells me that when I'm making clear coherent points and they're not and then they turn around and tell me that I'm in the denial stage of grief or you're fighting against technology advancements you know you're a Luddite you're against remix culture you hate freedom of expression you're depressed oh this is the worst one you're you're depriving the masses of a creative outlet and this is actually one that was used by the CEO of stability AI uh Ahmad mustak the hedge fund boss who just got 101 million dollars in Venture Capital money for his AI company which is built on Stolen artwork and says that artists who oppose him are like Aristocrats who try to keep poor people from learning to read seriously and opponents are arguing for skill segregation skills segregation for real like this is the type of guy who is Gonna Act Like a pencil and paper don't exist and that like a pencil and paper cost you like a hundred thousand dollars to attain he goes on to say they'd rather keep a monopoly on visual communication dude like for you to characterize digital artists as ruling class bourgeoisie Aristocrats who are hoarding their abilities depriving it from the masses we're not talking about food here the French Revolution let them eat cake type thing these are artists portfolios this is an artist's skill set which he uses to earn a living it costs the artist a mountain of time effort and determination to build up to a portfolio that good it's not yours to take what an entitled little man baby a failed artist with no one to blame with his head stuck in the talent paradigm all right I need to bring my energy down because this subject does get me worked up what we need to do every time these dirty argument tactics are used is to backtrack the discussion we need to go back to the central thing because what I'm finding and this happens with artists in artist discussions so much is that we have this progression AI art is using stolen data sets Okay we start that that's the important one guys the first one then we progress to AI images are getting mistaken for Human Art and then we progress to what does this mean for the future of artists now it's important to have those existential discussions but I just don't want us to drop the first point here AI art is using stolen data sets that's the important point we can't forget that guys because the reason that images AI images are getting mistaken for Human Art is because they are trained on Stolen data sets we should only have these existential discussions when the issue of artist exploitation is resolved so forget about these two for now we've got to take it back to the basics let's do some debunking now because we're still on that topic of raising public awareness improving our ability to debunk flawed arguments being made so we start with the gaslighting I suppose you're just mad that you have been replaced no artists are mad that they are being robbed we will figure out the existential questions about the future of art later but for now don't change the subject of the massive Injustice that's happening which by the way is unlike any historical example they're going to try and bring up analogies of farmers who protested the combine harvester things of that nature it's not the same theft is not the same here AI technology isn't hurting anyone wrong artists and photographers invest thousands of dollars in art education thousands of dollars in equipment and hundreds of thousands of dollars in opportunity costs artists are being left in debt as a direct result of the profitable theft of their images by image scrapers and image generators I just want you to see these two case studies here of Master artists that were exploited here Greg Rakowski his artwork was taken and trained in an AI against his wishes over 93 000 times and then he was cyberbullied by AI artists it's just ironic to me that the hardest working artists are the ones that are most targeted for this the the ones who are the most dedicated who have spent the most Decades of their lives Master Kim jong-gi's art was fed into an AI model without his family's consent the day after he died on October the 3rd this year and was used to create these awful imitations that was in such poor taste Kim jong-gi prided himself on just doing everything manually like on analog pen on paper right he wasn't a digital guy to rip his artwork it's just disgraceful that's like the artist's perspective but that's not the only people being wronged by this we also have clients being scammed I've just made five gigs on Fiverr here's what we're offering City and Landscape concept art dog portraits Dungeons and Dragons character and Landscape are heavy metal and rock album covers anime and furry character art we're trying everything receiving AI art instead of human-made art they're being sold fake custom art that they can't own the copyright to right you cannot own the copyright from AI generated art if there have not been insignificant editing of that AI generated image so you have these prompters and AI Bros just looking to make a quick bug they are lying to clients telling them that they are hand painting these images when in fact they are just prompting them and then they sell them for a significant commission fee to clients and the client doesn't own what they're buying it's a scam clients are being scammed so it's not good for clients and also we have celebrities celebrities are being targeted with degrading pornographic deep fakes here are three examples that are being used Emma Watson you have Megan Fox and Billy eilish I think I'd be safe to assume that this is doing Untold psychological damage to these human beings and their families it's not cool not to mention it's the exploitation of their brands which costs a lot of time and money for them to build a celebrity like Emma Watson she has signed movie deals she has worked in front of the camera she has put a lot of investment into things like makeup and hair and clothing her entire brand is being taken here without her permission so it's not just artists of course I am focusing on the artists here but this is another group of people who is being taken advantage of here uh you'll hear people say that AI is just a tool this is like their favorite one of their favorite catchphrases they'll just post it comments without listening to anything that's being said AI is just a tool that is trying to take heat away from their unethical actions and it's trying to give prompters undue credit for creating these things you know if they say it's a tool then it's like oh I'm using the tool to create an image when really the tool is using you bro but in this case the crime was committed in the making of the tool these tools were trained on Stolen data sets therefore the problem is embedded within the tool itself using one of these unethical AIS in any capacity is endorsing that the mass exploitation of an entire industry is okay multiple Industries actually as I just established also no it's a replacement there's a difference the Target customer for AI in the majority of cases is entirely different from the artists who were targeted for the theft and you actually hear this being said by the developers of these AIS these so-called tools are designed to Rob artists of their visual styles that took them years sometimes decades to attain with no permission or royalties going back to the artist most of these apps have the feature of targeting specific artists by name to rob their small specific catalog of work when talking to artists the AI apologist will call it the tool when making the app to Consumers the AI developer will give an entirely different story telling you of a mystical computer mind that just fathoms up art from scratch without any help or Talent needed I want to actually show you an example of what I just said where they're targeting specific artists there's a small community I suppose you could call it of people who are developing an AI to specifically try to emulate the style and brand of Sam does Arts you can see communities of prompters going after specific artists I'm going to get back to Sanders Arts later because he's a great example for how individual artists are being targeted and are being exploited for their portfolios beyond a shadow of a doubt and they're being named they're literally not even trying to hide the name of the person they're plagiarizing don't stand in the way of technological progress bro this is another one that I've heard as a retort don't stand in the way of Technology this is the very very juvenile assumption that new tech equals good in all situations so does that mean you're down with chemical weapons surveillance States eugenics you see like new tech doesn't automatically equal good we have to question new technology we have to uh be careful and responsible like are you just going to blindly adopt new tech without questioning if it's safe and ethical like that's very irresponsible false equivalence so this is usually where ai apologists go to hide they hide with the false equivalence I think among all of the debunking this is the most popular one for AI Bros they will try to tell you that the creative process is the same for artists as it is for AI no it is not this opinion is so shallow It could only be held by someone who has not spent significant time making art I'm sorry artists and AI have entirely different processes to get to where they are the AIS work backwards from a data set they do what they're told they're 100 OB obedient they cannot innovate as a result of that they have this very dangerous damaging unlimited output which can harm our virtual spaces it copies and remembers perfectly which artists can't artists have these limitations put in which are a good thing it works backwards from the finished results artists work forward artists start with an impetus artists start with an intention this false equivalence is what I would call the AI apologist fallacy they want you to believe that AI is a revolutionary new technology that changes the way art is made and at the same exact time they also want you to believe that AI uses the exact same process as human artists and they hold both these contrasting arguments at the exact same time they want you to believe both they don't make sense you can't believe both at the same time take a look at these human-made Arts it takes so many different forms it's so diverse I love the diversity of human-made art if you think artists have been spending centuries just imitating the other artists they see around them how on Earth did we arrive at the level of creative diversity flourishing in the world today it's very clear that the way that AI art works and the way that human art works are completely different there are so many other ingredients such as lived experience that go into a human artist's work that make it distinctly a different process from AI Arts anyway that was just a distraction they were trying to smoke screen us right they try to draw you into these existential difficult to answer questions to make you forget about the data laundering right and I guess you could say I fell for it there I went into too much detail to explain how Human Art is different from AI Arts so let's bring it back on topic if they at first tried to reduce the AI art thing to make it simple to make it like oh but AI art is just doing what humans do now they're trying to make it a more complex process you just don't know enough about how deep learning works if you knew more details about the wonders of deep learning you would be converted we know about the steps AI uses to train you start with the data sets very essential component that you have those data sets then you've got the other processes you've got the Deep learning you've got it stored in latent space the technology is very smart you have the use of gaussian noise to generate images into kind of randomize the results and then you have a multiple choice output selection okay we understand that we are focused on the unlicensed theft occurring at this step here the first step in the process the Foul Play that's been done here does not require expertise to understand the foul play only requires expertise if you're trying to excuse it if you're trying to excuse the exploitation going on then I guess you need to bamboozle people with these steps about deep learning latent space about noise generation and isn't it funny that after all those complex steps it still clearly has the ability to plagiarize now I'm going to read you this excerpt from a disappointed mid-journey user she writes it makes sense to say mid-journey can return copyrighted imagery if that's what the person asked for but then my overall confidence in mid-journey is lowered I have no way of knowing if my attempt to create an original image caused mid-journey to return a copyright image perhaps this only happens in very intentional prompts and not by accident but that's unknown I hope that would be the case but I don't know you see there's this uncertainty with mid-journey users where all mid-journey users don't know if the image that's been created is a rip-off if it exists somewhere else in the world just as a very slightly altered variation any image that's generated could be with the current technology it's so irresponsible you can't steal a style bro I've heard this one brought up a lot just one of those quick things to just kind of bamboozle you oh yeah you can't steal a Style again yes there I guess they have a license to do whatever they want so it's true you can't steal a style but AI store artwork AI stole images AI stall IPS AI store portfolios I'm sure I'm sounding like a broken record here if you can impersonate an artist's style without stealing any of their images for your data set without illegally trolling the websites and using them for something that they did not consent to if you didn't do that and you were able to impersonate their style I guess you would win fair and square but the fact is these AIS stole from artists and the public without any permission to get those Styles and it hasn't been proven that they can reach those Styles without those data sets those stolen data sets without professional ads in the data sets image results would look more like this this was trained on a data set of about 30 million labeled images given the size of that data set I think it's safe to assume that most concept art and digital art was not contained within the data sets this goes to show that the ai's use cases depend entirely upon the quality and quantity of the images in the data sets mid-journey Dali stable diffusion would not be worth a fraction of their valuations if they followed copyright law and yet they have never to my knowledge they have never given any credit or attributes or any acknowledgment to the professional concept artists who own those copyrights who are driving the quality of the results in their AI image generators artists don't have a legal case against AI image generators wrong wrong the legal cases that are going to be brought up when they are finally taken to court breaching millions of copyrights at once knowingly misusing non-profit data sets for profits we have a word for this now it's data laundering it's not cool a breach of data privacy GDP regulations this is according to EU law and d false advertising maybe the data sets are covered by fair use right this is what a lot of people have been saying no let's read fair use Doctrine shall we by looking at these four we can clearly see with beyond the shadow of a doubt that three out of the four are just like hands down yes the only reason I didn't highlight number two is because I've personally have never understood number two it doesn't really make sense the nature of copyrighted work it's a weird one but if we read number one three and four number one purpose and character of the use including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit educational purposes is it for profit or non-profit the results of this it's for profit guys number three the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to copyrighted work as a whole and number three is a hard one to pin down but we can see from the fact that you can name artists in prompts that it's extremely weighted towards a specific group of artists most of these image generators can and are being used to Target single artists or a single images number four is effect of the use upon potential market for or value of copyrighted work we're gonna witness this but the effect that is going to have on digital art in general and photography is just going to be catastrophic here's another important thing that I didn't include in the documentation here but you don't need that one to be proved you only need to prove that it is a threat so for example you don't need to wait until the digital art industry is in rubble to assume that the effect is going to be bad and I have evidence for those three points AI image generators are offering premium tears which they are profiting from but also that the prompters are exploiting AI images for profits in merchandise in commissions and in building social media followings I'm going to show you how you can generate insane amounts of money with AI generator guys I cannot believe it in the middle here we have this AI plugin for blender where you can literally just from a top-down selection process you can just decide by name their real names it will use their data sets to create a style that is basically the same I've got to thank Carla Ortiz for this because she has curated so much evidence about this that was really helpful so go and follow her on Twitter you can see here there's evidence to show that artists jobs are being taken away by this by AI there are companies such as in this example this company used an AI image generator to create their poster artwork that's an artist's job right there an artist's job gone because of AI image generators because of stolen data sets I imagine someone might misuse this they could accuse me of breaking fair use because I'm using memes no you see I can create meme times because of fair use fair use is protecting us in using educational like for criticism for analysis so fair use is great I love fair use but don't hide behind fair use when you steal the world's data everyone's data and don't ask them permission when using a new technology that we're not sure about we're not sure about the consequences it's especially important that you don't just take people's data without their consent a lot of us are not on board with how AI is treating this data a lot of us don't trust it you especially need consent when it's a new technology gdpr I need to talk about as well so this is in the EU I'm no lawyer but this is what is said on the official website I'll try and Link it in the description the rights of individuals the gdpr lists the rights of data subject meaning the rights of individuals whose personal data is being processed the need for an individuals clear consent to the processing of his or her personal data easier access for the data subject to his or her personal data the right to rectification to Erasure and to be forgotten right now we don't have that feature the right to object including to the use of personal data for the purposes of profiling right now there is so much personal data inside lion 5B the right to data portability from one service provider to another the regulation also lays down the obligation for controllers who are responsible for processing of the data to provide transparent and easily accessible information to individuals on the processing of their data mid journey is not doing that it's a black box stable diffusion to my knowledge is not doing that Dolly e is not doing that they are not being clear with how their data is being processed or what data is being stored or used they are in breach of most of these gdpr regulations maybe the lawyers can squirm out of it somehow I don't know they have a lot of money now so they can afford lawyers I suppose but this data laundering was done in bad faith and it should not have the support of the public much less the art community I expect that the majority of the public will not support the misuse of their data and their inability to opt out I want to talk a little bit more about lion 5B for a moment because I've been dropping its name here and there lion 5B was funded by stability AI it was originally used for non-commercial purposes that's how they had permission to troll the internet and scrape all these images together we know that it's been used for commercial purposes with these AI companies these AI companies are valued at billions of dollars it contains 5.6 billion images and Text data so it basically hoovered up a majority of the internet's images found within these data sets it in includes non-consensual porn Isis executions child porn medical record photos racially discriminatory images there is bad stuff inside these data sets the creators have gone on record saying that they have not successfully filtered out all of these dark results from their data set I think the illusion of believing that my mother is perfectly safe just because I excluded all the harmful data from it is a little bit naive because there could be gaps in the filtering or harmful actors will take them and fine-tune them easily so this is a false safety true safety only can come from really careful thinking and Engineering on a more personal note there are photos identifying probably everyone you know within this your mother sister son daughter if they exist they're probably in this data set probably a profile picture and probably their name as well because it's text and image the real names of real people inside this data set it's a huge breach of privacy it's a huge breach of consent so now that I've done the debunking I have a question for AI apologists and for the AI developers AI image generators could have made developments ethically so why didn't they they could have trained only using public domain images they could have used data sets vetted by a neutral third party they could have made artists opt in to the data set so artists would have to give their consent or else they wouldn't be included and they could have offered royalty deals to these artists who opted in simple stuff but they decided to take the unethical exploitative way you funded a legal loophole in Germany to train your AI on billions of images littered with copyrights you decided to vilify and Gaslight the artists you're stealing from you just released this dangerous technology to the public and you rolled out subscriptions as soon as possible to cash in on this so the question actually is quite an easy one to answer it's all about money and valuations guys stability AI you can see that it gets a one billion dollar valuation the 18th of October 20 22. there's a good business model we've negotiated massive deals so we can be profitable at the door versus most money losing big corporations don't be too smart about your lean business model Ahmad I know why your business model is so profitable it's because you don't pay out royalties to the artists you screwed over the AI arms race has begun and there's this Winner Takes all rush to get something out they all did this very irresponsibly because they wanted to get that money it's like a gold rush for many years really they've had this shallow doctrine of disruption equals good in all situations it's like it doesn't matter who you screw over it doesn't matter who loses out from this it doesn't matter whose lives you're damaging it's disruption we're going after disruption because that's where the most profit is also Digital Arts in particular was calculated as being less of a legal threat than the music industry yes they prayed on the art industry because they saw it as being weak in terms of the legal backbone of artists and there's this attitude of if we move fast enough maybe people will just go with it and forget about it image I think is the killer app because when you look at this it's a wonder for people that they can suddenly create rather than consume and that's something that's across the board you know the comparators are Snapchat or Tick Tock where you can create as Pokemon go you know gacha games and these kinds of things say odds could you please just say that art exists and that you didn't invent creativity with this I get that you're from a gaming background but you must know about the art industry because every single noteworthy image that's been generated with stable diffusion has done so with an artist's name in their prompt with AI anything is possible except for common decency apparently so this is David Holtz interview in a Forbes article here is one of the questions did you see consent from living artists or work still under copyrights to which David Holtz replies no there's no way to find a picture on the internet and then automatically trace it to an owner and then have any way of doing anything to authenticate it these AI Geniuses supposedly couldn't find an easy way to automate consent what a shame oh we just it was difficult it was tricky like the consent thing is difficult from a developer's standpoint so we found a solution though our solution was that we just took everyone's images without their consent we just decided to backstab them all basically they could have taken their time to build a verification system they could have built an image portal for volunteers to opt in and to upload their images to they could have licensed image archives the conventional way they could have just not broken copyright law for millions of people a single copyright violation is a tragedy a million copyright violations is a statistic okay maybe I went a bit too far on that one I don't know I can't read the room here I'm just on my own in my office okay we got a meme finally I was beginning to despair a bit too much it's been nothing but lies deceit and question dodging from these CEOs very slimy slippery kind of question answering can artists opt out from being included in data training model he says we're looking into that the challenge now is finding out what the rules are and how to figure out if a person is really the artist of a particular work or just putting their name on it we haven't encountered anyone who wants their name taken out of the data set that we could actually find in the data set lies that is a lie right there can artists opt out of being named in prompts he says not right now we're looking at that again we have to find a way to authenticate those requests which can get complicated okay so why didn't you try and solve this before you launched you're looking into it this is a product that you launched already what an irresponsible thing to do all of the big players they give commercial rights to what prompters make they take from rights holders and they sell them to prompters these are the subscription models if you think they aren't profitable if you think they're just giving it away because in all of these talks they do they always frame it as like them giving they are giving to people it's not it's a SAS business dude it's subscription as a service mid-journey has a subscribe description membership costs Dolly has a sort of credits model stable diffusion has a credit model they are making bank from this make no mistake one more little bit from the Forbes article because it is such a juicy Forbes article this journalist I need to bring his name up because like he asked good questions the output from your product is imagery which has a commercial value in professional context in addition to all of those other properties and this is very disruptive of that economy David Holtz gives the weakest flimsiest slimy answer I can think of he says I think it's like we're making a boat and somebody can race with the boat but it doesn't mean that the boat's about racing if you use a boat to race then like maybe yeah sure in that moment it is okay so it's the guns don't kill people arguments now that he's made and developed this software and has done it in a very irresponsible way now he's distancing himself from the tool that he's made and saying well you know it's a tool it can be used for lots of different things he's basically saying like we haven't made the software to be used by professionals and for companies and for corporate use but if you do happen to be a corporation then we're going to charge you for it and negotiate with us to how much it will cost to license that image good news finally basically the US copyright office refused copyrights from AI generated images in other words if you generate an image with one of these AI image generators you do not own the copyright the US copyright office will not recognize that as a copyright so that's a good thing so it essentially blocked the ability for them to realistically give the rights away to to these things what is your sort of opinion if someone comes to you and says your model produces horrible output here I I can show you I would say of course humanity is horrible if they use technology in horrible ways and good ways as well but at the same time like I said I think that this is positive technology for Humanity it should diffuse because in the pace of innovation to make it beneficial as well as to combat negative uses is far greater oh good good I was beginning to worry there okay it's all right guys it's no problem Emma just said that our suffering will be worth it in the end and I guess this means he doesn't need to do anything to fix the massive gaping problems in his AI model so if you're the victim of revenge porn or you're the victim of constant plagiarism false impersonations your livelihood taken away from you it's okay because somewhere in the world a kid is spamming prompts to make a hundred anime waifu iterations per day and Emma decided for you that that makes it all worthwhile some of you may die but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make yeah choose for involving the community Ahmad AI is in the hands of some very irresponsible people I hope you can see that by now these developers need to be restrained by Democratic processes and held accountable when they cause damage and they need to slow down people are getting hurt by this and they are not paying any attention they will say that they are all about an empowering creatives they will say that they want to bring about a Utopia by AI if you're an artist they don't care about you they are trying to pretend like you don't exist they are trying to minimize the impact of your words and maximize the use of your images that you worked for years to create that's another thing as well like Academia um companies all these things I think too many people in our community are unhappy and obviously there's a lot of new atypical people within our community right I'm neurotypical myself you know um I want to see how we can have a happier community that supports each other that would imply that it goes both ways and that you support artists emad how about we support each other in this way um you leave artists websites out of your data sets and we leave you alone yeah that sounds like a great Community to me no parasitic relationship just two distinctly separate communities double standards this is by stability AI this is dance diffusion dance diffusion is a music AI in the music industry they are respecting the copyrights this is the same company stability AI That's behind an image generator right so how are they treating it differently for the music industry let's read this dance diffusion is also built on data sets composed entirely of copyright free and voluntary provided music and audio samples because dance diffusion models are prone to memorization and overfitting releasing a model trained on copyright data could potentially result in legal issues in honoring the intellectual property of artists while also complying to the best of their ability with are often strict copyright standards of the music industry keeping any kind of copyrighted material out of training data was a must so why are they being so reasonable when it comes to respecting the rights of the music industry the copyrights of the music industry well it's because the music industry has teeth if you replace the words music and audio samples and the music industry with the word Arts that's essentially what we want we want that kind of behavior so I'm going to outline the simple demands these are the demands that I think that we as artists should be making and we should not stop until these demands are met first of all remove the ability to name artists in prompts this feature exploits a massive breach of personal data rights under EU law it enables and encourages prompters to falsely impersonate artists it enables prompters to tap directly into specified artists portfolio and brands for profitable exploitation they should remove this feature immediately swiftly introduce a feature to manually search and remove images from Lyon and also I'm aware that there are other data sets so not just lion but any data set used in AI now this would only affect future releases due to how the AI is trained unfortunately so for current models you can't really backtrack in terms of what it's been trained on but this would affect future releases which most of the public are likely to adopt it would allow millions of unhappy artists performance and public figures a way out from this blatant exploitation we want an escape it would force these black box AI companies to be transparent with the public about how their data is being used with billions of dollars in Venture Capital funding the data sets already logged and money pouring in through subscription fees this feature is well within your budget limitations I'm talking to the big players in AI I'm talking about stability AI mid-journey Dali all future data sets should be opt in you would have to knowingly ask for your images to be used in their data sets that's basically what I mean by opt-in this would respect the Dignity of deceased artists and their families it would prevent the uninformed coercion of older less Tech informed artists and citizens and it would stay true to the spirit of data Privacy Law to the big players in the AI space stop stop finding new Industries to exploit and start remaking your current apps with these features options and limitations in place please a public apology would also be nice but it's not expected I suppose because it's above freezing which is good because that means I can paint without using any antifreeze in my water medium but I have a view along the stream that I like so the next most important and obvious thing we want to do to gain more control over our Creations is find artists to use in our prompt just scroll through look what catches your eye okay I've been talking a little bit about AI Bros prompters and AI apologists I want to go into a theory of the origin story of the AI bro the AI artist whatever you want to call them I mean here are two little screenshots I've found on Twitter one of them who's just ragging on the artist that he's exploiting and the other one asking can I train a model based on my favorite artist's work and start taking commissions basically just rubbing two brain cells together to just Connect the Dots here you can see the idea forming in his tiny little Primal mind I mean to the guy's credit at least he asked permission I guess he's here's a theory here's a theory for you in 2020 and moving into 2021 mid to 2021 you had the pump boys these uh Bros who were pumping meme coins and it was the greater fool Theory at play alt coins meme coins that had known inherent value and I remember on Discord in 2020 and 2021 I was getting at least two DMS per day from random people and these Bots were sending me an invite to a pump group where they would pump these old coins and then in 2021 you see the rise of the nft Bros just like with crypto the technology itself is very is very interesting and I'm sure it will have future applications but you have this wave of bros that's the only way I can put it because it was such a new technology they were using nfts to basically try to make a quick profit while doing as little work as possible and then in 2022 you have the AI prompters I think they've kind of moved on because my inbox in Discord has not had any nft pump group requests or meme coin requests for a long time now I think it's because they've all moved on to AI prompting that's the their new hustle Unfortunately they are also joined by fledgling artists who haven't really got many formed opinions about art and also they are joined by unfortunately just the uninformed public who is not aware of the moral and ethical issues surrounding AI art because it's being played down in many of these circles key characteristics of the AI Bros though as a core group of people my observations are they want a quick profit for a minimal effort are willing to exploit others in the process and they use new technology before legislation catches up that looks insane so for the next 30 days I'm gonna try to sell a ir and see how much money I can make with my masterpiece let's try to generate a gangster baby oil painting that baby is looking fresh even most artists are mostly unknown to the mainstream public and this makes it easy to impress people with slightly mutated art from unfamiliar Masters just add the false marketing about the AI forming original art and hey you have a license to steal prompters use information disparity to build social media followings sell merchandise and take on commissions with unlicensed unethical images propped up by the art industry there are so many ways that I can use Dali to create artwork that I would have previously had to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars on to hire an artist to create for me I'm excited for me I'm excited for me the prompter sees art as worthless pixels on a screen pixels which can be taken and exploited they're kind of like pixel Merchants the prompter refuses to acknowledge the vast time money and effort that went into making these original or images that have been stolen and this naivety can partly be blamed I believe on social media the major social media networks are literally changing the name of artwork photography music and film to content which in my opinion is just such a degrading word it's kind of like a trough of feed more than ever people are dissociating art from the hard-working risk-taking people who made it an artist makes art what makes content I suppose anything can make content right you have content creators yes but content kind of opens up the floor to allow this kind of endless computer generated feed Force feeding you mush over and over again over things that aren't meaningful art used to be a lot more valued so anyway getting back to the AI Bros I quite like this meme that I found the character of the AI bro and the AI prompter they didn't have the patience to learn this software but then when stability AI comes around they change their tune completely and they say like I've always been a genius adapts to AI or become obsolete ludd eyes watch out as your Superior takes your jobs do you really think that trained artists couldn't beat you at prompting if they didn't have the backbone that they have like if they didn't have the moral fiber that they have to not use prompters you don't think that artists could wipe the floor with you at prompting because this is what we're trained at we are trained to be creative we spend our lives studying Arts anyway it's just just kind of a funny meme I thought this was very accurate at first I thought I would portray them like like an evolving ape you know they're evolving from mean coins to nfts to AI art but there's no Evolution involved they're actually more like locusts I would say they have a very short attention span and that's why they've only arrived in the art scene when it became reduced to a quick multiple choice selection process a bit like what you have at a character selection screen on a game I'm at my place right now and he has an insane gaming PC with an Nvidia GPU let's generate some air yeah bananas and space baby we've got Elon Musk banana spaceship just like Locust the majority will leave as soon as there's a new AAA game that comes out or there is a bigger opportunity to exploit some poor souls for easy money somewhere else are you a prompter watching this this is the impression you are making on the artist Community to stop prompting until we have a fair system established plus if you sign up to one of their memberships then you can legally sell the artwork that you create so as you can see they have three different plans if you're paying these image generators you are a very big part of the problem we're not saying that the image generators and developers aren't to blame they are absolutely to blame but you are enabling them you are giving the product value when you decide to turn your back on the moral and ethical issues with AI generated images so here's something that you can do that is completely legal but whether it's ethical is another question is he about to acknowledge that AI artists insanely unethical for the artists that are forced into being in the data sets you can copy the prompt oh never mind I guess Make It Rain I want to bring this to a specific case study that I um mentioned earlier Sam does Arts this guy has been in the firing line of prompters of AI Bros I haven't followed Sam does Arts that closely but I have been aware of him for a number of years I've seen his art and his YouTube videos he's a very popular artist his artwork is very aesthetic he specializes I suppose in painting females now they've set up this subreddits I was just I'll I'll just show you I was appalled at what I saw in this subreddit which was kind of focused on Sanders Arts they were working to get as close to Sam's art style as possible and they were openly using Sam's name and copyright related brand for this like that's part of the appeal is like you can get the Sam does Arts look to the images that this generates now people are using some specific data set a portfolio he built over many years as a kind of marionette doll to serve their every whim so I put together this Meme here um by the way all the memes will be available in the description below you can you can download them and spread them we need to spread the word about these problems okay like I think memes are quite an effective way to get the word out about what's going on in these spaces these were the images that were showcased by the developer showing what you can do with this new prompter that specifically targets Sam does Arts so he starts off with bunnies and then I feel like the developer was almost hinting at what this could be used for and you have generated pictures of uh military uniform and things yeah it just made me think about how this is being used kind of as a marionette doll to serve other people's whims but the problem is that this is getting mistaken for Sam does Arts his brand is being tarnished by this it's being watered down and his livelihood is being taken away from him by his own stolen art how's he going to get commissions if anyone can create any image in Sandoz art style because of his stolen images by the way because of his stolen data set how can he take on commissions from now on if that's something he wants to do for money you know he's had that option that livelihood taken away from him how could he run merch when someone can just prompt I'm going to show you how you can generate insane amounts of money with AI generator guys I cannot believe it here we have like on the subreddit we have this battle of the sand which Sam does Arts model does it best they are literally competing on how close they can get to imitating Sam's style and doing uh these false impersonations this is kind of like a deep fake of an artist's brand look if you haven't been an artist I will tell you your brand is everything it's an artist everything hinges on your brand if your brand is sullied by something like this it causes a lot of damage to your livelihood now this is the most infuriating part so I will be reading this out I'm gonna read it out because I want you to get a feel for how condescending these AI Bros are to the artist that they are ripping off hey Sam hope you're doing well this holiday season to be honest we had no idea who you were until a minor drama outbreak occurred on our stable diffusion regarding a lone hobbyist obvious taking some time to create an homage to your art style oh right it's an old mileage is it so that anyone with stable diffusion could attempt to recreate your work perhaps even improve it what the hell like this guy is so oh as you may or may not be aware you probably are aware your reaction to calling out this individual and his work created a Streisand effect resulting in a slew of aspiring AI artists taking up the task of creating models in your art style Sam does Arts is now not only one of the most copied models but also the most downloaded in the event that you're actually some kind of reverse psychology Savant and wanted this to happen to better spread your style and marketing then Bravo fantastic job if not well unfortunate to celebrate the work of These Fine creators find creators what the you really think they're creators to celebrate the work of These Fine creators we're hosting a battle of the Sams where members of R stable diffusion can vote on which of your models did it best first prize will be an 8x10 of any of your prints from your print shop since we actually believe in supporting artists I've linked a couple of entries for your famous scrutiny if none of these are up to Snuff we'd love to work with you to create an official Sanders Arts model could be a fun project all the best civitai I don't know who civitai is the host of this forum sense a mocking email to Sam basically saying we are taking your style and there's nothing you can do about it and also trying to make the case in some way that they believe in supporting artists basically saying that like the publicity that this has gotten for Sam's name is making up for any of the harm that they're doing I don't know about you but this kind of email just makes me so mad like artists like Sam need to be protected Sam basically asked them to stop this literally the guy who their entire model is based on and they are taunting him linking to him all of these entries of people that are that are exploiting his artwork and it doesn't stop there the redditor who created the latest like version 4 model of Sam does Arts impersonator was complaining about underrepresentation in Sam's portfolio and taking matters into his own hands to fix the problem so he was complaining about this character who shows up a lot in Sam's portfolio this female with white hair and saying that like the community has more varied interests and fixing this problem in Sam's portfolio which is so condescending I mean I know guys we're not talking about legal stuff anymore like we're just talking about disrespect the disrespect and entitlement that these prompters have towards an artist like Sam is like overwhelming this character this girl we don't know who she is right but this could be Sam's representation of his real life girlfriend or a significant other for all we know whoever she is she is important to Sam Sam's painted her and drawn her many times so this is an important character to Sam and this AI could be used to do things like to twist her into indecent and undignified poses which the more I think about it the more just like disgusted I am about this community that is taking all of these Liberties that they never should have had in the first place they never had the right to do this to an artist they should not have the right to do this it's amazing how Sandra helper can be 100 reliant on Sam's art style and yet have such disrespect for him at the same time this is just one clear example of artists portfolios and Brands being specifically targeted for plagiarism and misuse but there are more happening as we speak I mean in the comments of this model one comment was said yo can we get a wallop please that guy is a real Bonafide art God so they're gonna go after woolops soon as well because he also makes images of pretty women so it's just going to continue they're just going to go around to their favorite artists and they're gonna they're gonna export these models and just completely Sully their brand they literally attach the artist's name to these artworks into this generator it's absolutely disgraceful these can be made to do very dark things to an artist I can only imagine what it feels like for Sam to to witness this happening he must be distraught at this I know I would be luckily they're not really using it to endorse a war or to maybe they are making porn I don't know but I guess it's lucky that most of these AI eyebrows don't have very high Ambitions this is a meme that I just took off of their the same subreddit just to show you that they don't really have very high Ambitions but look behind the data that has been stolen this massive data Heist that's mostly affecting right now comic artists and illustrators concept artists digital artists modelers and photographers as well behind all of this data and these data sets are real people being exploited go ahead look at their faces these are real people and they have names go ahead and look at their names they are the ones being exploited and it's not just pixels on a screen it's hard work it's thousands of hours of hard concentration thousands of dollars in equipment and student debt they are professionals they pay rent with their Arts some of them have kids they have invested in their artwork and their brand so that they can pay off these debts so that they can provide for their families they're some of the hardest working people I know they bring so much joy and life into the world at Great cost to them you think it's fun to make hundreds of high quality concept art renders why don't you try it it's hard work it's it takes dedication it takes grit it's a great cost to them and I can't stand to see their work being forced into a meat grinder with no way out they have no consent in this they do not give their consent and someone needs to stand up for them we need to speak out for them we need to support them if people say I'm biased heck yeah I'm biased artists did nothing wrong in this artists didn't start this mess artists don't deserve this and they should protest I won't be a Stan Pro kapanko sitting comfortably in the middle saying well both sides make good points like it's two warring tribes with equal claim to some land that's not honest we're respectfully but firmly reject the falsehoods made by these AI Advocates we don't want to be bodies with people who degrade our work we want accountability for the damage they have caused and a behavioral shift on the side of the AI developers to caution and responsibility holding social media accountable social media sites are a key player in this I have made three different groups here you've got the bad social media sites who are not coming out in support of artists you have the good social media points who have been decisive on their treatment of artists and taking aside and rolling against non-consensual data scraping on their websites in the bad section right now you have meta Google and art station this isn't an exhaustive list there are others that I don't know about and they're subject to change like they could change their policy on the good side you have new grounds I love new grounds of course Kickstarter 3D total arts.io pH so yeah Orange YouTube and the ones I don't know are Instagram and Pinterest I'll get into these a little bit in more depth new grounds Kickstarter 3D total arts.io the ones on the good list have all written it into their policy you're officially not allowed to data scrape from these websites and also they have some kind of control on accepting AI projects or accepting AI artwork with Kickstarter it's not a social media site it's a crowdfunding platform but they have been taking down irresponsible AI projects from being funded they've taken them down off their platform 3D total has been fantastic in its support of the crowdfunding that I talked about in the earlier part of the video the ones that I don't know about are Instagram don't really know where they stand on it I know they're owned by meta but I'm not sure and Pinterest Pinterest I don't know their official policy but I do know that a lot of their images are scraped off of Pinterest and Pinterest has sort of like helps these data scrapers because Pinterest is a website that uses AI to organize and categorize and arrange images but let's talk about art station because this is the the least popular artists website in the world right now I would say and that's because it betrayed its user base it sold us out basically making decisions that are against its entire use base and will ultimately lead to the downfall of this portfolio site choosing to become an unlimited feed of AI generated art by accepting AI generated art in and drowning out the portfolios of real artists with endless AI variations this will make it extremely difficult for recruitment which is what the website was about in the first place it was about real artists connecting with other real artists looking at portfolios and hiring people instead it's selling out all of its human users to feed the meat grinder and they basically said that they're not Banning any AI generated artwork from being posted there and also by default they are not ruling out the AI image scraping which I think is disgraceful here's evidence of that why are all projects not tagged with no AI by default does that mean if I don't use the tag I am allowing it and their response is We Believe artists should be free to decide how their art is used and simultaneously we don't want to become Gatekeepers with site terms that stifle AI research and commercialization when it respects artists choices and copyright law AI research is not respecting artist choices and copyright law so why are you respecting them you're basically echoing the gas lighting that's going on against artists when you say that that artists are stifling AI research no we want control over our own images the images that we own the copyright to we want control over them every AI generated image is breaking the website rules and yet they ignore this because in their policy they say when you post stuff to Art station make sure that you own it or that you have permission to post it when you create an AI image you neither own it or have permission to post it because it's using AIS that were trained on data sets that you don't have permission to use the AI does not have permission to use so by their own logic every single AI generated image on artstation is breaking their own terms of service their own policy it leads to the question why are they doing this are they being paid off because that's the only explanation I can come up with they say they're not getting paid by any AI art companies but my guess is yes I would guess that they are being paid somewhere there is some corruption involved in art station there's no other explanation for it why would they betray their entire user base and now art station are trying to silence their users instead of updating policy so this is before and after the silencing the vast majority of artists are making images in protest of the misuse of the platform and of their images which they own and then afterwards you can see that they've just systematically gone along and just Search and Destroy try to find every single protest image and delete it they missed one there in the middle uh right there they missed it but um this is not because of a fall off in interest and just in case you were wondering like if artists are now like simmering down and the dust has settled and now artists are just getting along with things no artists are but mad as hell and we are not going to let this slide we are not going to drop the subject deviantART is doing what art station should okay here's an update from deviantART it said we heard the community feedback and now all deviations are automatically labeled as not authorized for use in AI data sets you don't understand how important that is it's so important that by default they are labeled as not authorized for AI use because that means that people who are recently deceased people who are not tech savvy who don't go onto the internet very much they might just post their images and then go away for six months on an art Retreat somewhere you shouldn't have to expect that your users are going to be logging on every day to check what's the latest situation a massive majority of users are not going to be informed enough to make those updates by default they should not be authorized but there is another thing so I've talked about my naughty list just and my nice list the websites that are doing good things they're siding with human artists but there is the problem of how are these data sets being formed which sites are they taking advantage of how they suck your artwork into the data set well it's actually very simple from what we can see from my suspicion and the suspicion of others it's very simple they actually just use a right-click save as option there are certain websites that actually disable this option so the websites that allow this where you can just go on go on to the feed and just right click save as art station deviantART Pinterest WordPress this makes it very easy for the web crawlers to Hoover up these images the websites that make it difficult are websites like 500px now I can demonstrate this right now for you I have 500 PX up here so this is a photography website it's got very high standard professional grade photography if I click into one of those images here and I try and right click save as look at what comes up it just tells me who the photograph is by now of course it can't completely prevent against screenshots but it's a bit more difficult it just adds a layer of difficulty in there for these web crawlers so my recommendation to website owners people like Tom fault who's running new grounds is I strongly recommend that you look into this technology with Instagram as well you would have to screenshot something to take it it's not as easy as a right click save as art station deviantART Pinterest WordPress and I would also add new grounds onto that if we look at new grounds here like here's the featured art right if I right click save as in that it's only going to save the thumbnail which is this tiny little square you'd have to click onto it to actually get the artwork up so that's quite good but it's not as ideal as Instagram and where you actually would have to screenshot it and these are all animations actually but you can't just right click save as you would save the web page based on what we found by looking inside the lion and 5B database you can search for an artist like James Gurney or Craig Mullins you can just search them in and you can see that Pinterest Pinterest Pinterest Pinterest don't know what that one is being a lot of them it's it's Pinterest and art station are really big corporates one of the reasons for that is because it's easy to scrape images from there because it's just as simple as moving your way along the grid right click save as just saving ads as you go it's just a theory right now I'm not actually sure how these web crawlers work so some people are saying like they're just really eager to put this whole thing in the past they're saying like these bad things have already happened they've already scraped the internet for images for all the images they've already done this they've already done that why are you talking about them and it's because it sets a precedent as one thing but also because the narrative surrounding these AI image generators as being irreversible is one propagated by the AI companies themselves and AI apologists they want you to think that the genie is out of the bottle and it can't be put back in because they just want us to move on to the next topic while they continue to profit off of another industry's hard work if these Reckless and irresponsible Heights go on scrutinized they will keep happening and believe me things can get worse things can get worse than the way they already are also Justice just because someone you know if someone robbed your house you don't say ah well it's in the past they should just be allowed to keep on burgling houses in the in the neighborhood no you want them to come to just this you want them to answer for their crimes this has been part five of a six-part series thank you to these people for helping me with information and encouragement and remember you can help in a really big way to bring this case to the highest authorities in the world the link to the crowdfunders is in the description of this video I mean some animators seem to feel safe where they are you know they say they will never make the crossover into animation to which I say they already are meta has just introduced make a video and they're not doing this by innovating they're doing it by sucking up millions of videos and letting the Deep learning do what it does it's not particularly Innovative I won't lie the results they have with this new beta are pretty bad but it will get better meta created make a video by scraping the entire Shutterstock archive watermarks and all over 10 million proprietary video clips with no consent or fees and they are following open ai's terrible example with this they they've almost kind of got permission to do this kind of bad behavior because of open AI so I don't think artists should feel safe I think artists need to start engaging in this problem that is sweeping the internet because it's going to invade all areas of creativity the situation is as bad as I'm making it sound we cannot give up though because as bad as it is it can get a lot worse from here if we don't hit the brakes on this train the situation is hopeless no this has just started remember I linked to you these crowdfunders they are on their way to being funded but they need your help they need your contribution so anything you can afford you know even if it's a five dollar donation or something really small it all adds up and then when you're looking back 50 years from now you can say that you helped to solve this you helped to save art next steps so we need to make AI art a taboo do not use AI image generators I know it can be tempting for some of you because it's curiosity but don't use them support real artists if you know that an artist that you follow has a patreon page give them a little something you know help them because they are going through hard times right now because of this their own artwork is being used against them give them funding on patreon fun day kickstarters give them a tip if they have some kind of virtual tip jar share their work support fundraisers class action lawsuits and protests and above all keep making art you cannot let this stop you guys and this brings me on to hope do I have any well my gut feeling is that this new wave of software is not all it's cracked up to be I expect an S curve in Innovation as the novelty of this software wears off I mean what you're seeing right now is like a really like some of the images being shared would not actually be popular images unless the whole meta Narrative of AI art was there to kind of hold them up it's a bit like the child drawing thing if a child holds up an artwork and says I drew this and it's like a half decent drawing like everyone applauds everyone loves it but if an adult holds up the same drawing no one notices and it's the same thing with AI it's like wow that's especially good considering that it was made by an AI this is an S curve and this is actually something we see a lot in the technology space the start of this curve is an exponential curve and it looks like it's never going to stop like when you hit the middle here you just think it's going to go through the roof you can tell the developers of this software like just think that the sky is the limit they think it's never going to stop they're never going to face any Tech hurdles while it's true that like this can Skyrocket for a long time the interest and Buzz runs out eventually people start to realize that like what they're seeing is just kind of fake it's not real it's not wholesome that right now they're really flawed by the beauty of some of these images what they're really stunned by is actually just a kind of distorted reflection of human art that they haven't seen before you have a lot of different technologies that do adhere to this kind of curve this kind of taper off in interest smartphones they stopped innovating smartphones years ago social media platforms they're all getting to be the same now they're not actually branching out in the way that you would hope nfts nothing's dying and it's dead you can think of other fads and fashion trends as well which they have their time and then they taper out because there's nothing of substance there guys the thing is we can all see that there's very little substance in these prompted images and there is so much substance in human-made art it's human made art will Outlast this trend that's my conviction anyway digital art will be permanently scarred from this new tech though the open source release made sure of that I don't want to leave you satisfied with a happy ending because the struggle is not over we must take action there's a lot we need to do to save our creative Industries it started with digital art but it won't end with digital art things can get a lot worse from here if we all stay passive luckily we have the power to affect what happens in the future look if we raise hell right now we hold protests we do boycotts we file class action lawsuits and we fund those class action lawsuits if we keep educating people and keep hosting discussions around this then the AI theft and abuse will be slowed down and maybe even stopped right and maybe even reversed back they say it's not possible to reverse this stuff because it's trained but I can see ways that they could at least for the majority of people now there will always be these open source AIS that will be pushed Underground around as kind of like a bit like pirated movies but the mainstream will adopt a more responsible and ethical AI if that is what the courts rule the arrows are pointing in the direction of the destruction of the art industry and the abortion of great future art there's a lot of human artwork that is yet to be made it's going to come out in five ten years 20 years from now and I believe that we are responsible right now for allowing that art to have a chance and the way we do that is by raising hell we do not give up we do not become apathetic we do not become nihilists we have to hope we have to hope and throughout all of this don't ever stop expressing yourself people who think I'll never be as good as what AI can produce you always had a superior in art there was always someone better than you when you stepped into this you weren't the best and you probably knew realistically that you were never going to be the best there's always a bigger fish and you didn't let that stop you before and nothing has changed in that regard there's still artists human and AI that are producing artwork that's better than you there will continue to be exciting opportunities for artists just like you you don't have to be the best at something to contribute to the medium you don't have to be top dog to have a voice and to get a lot out of the art experience the creative experience we will keep facing struggles but we will face them together you've got me I'm here I'm not going away I'm not going anywhere I'm keeping on business as usual nothing's changing for me my plans are the same hosting the animator Guild short film contest coming up this year change is nothing many more events after that that I've got planned as well I have a lot of plans in the works business as usual guys we keep creating we keep doing our thing we're not letting something like this stop us and I also want to bring you to this concept that I've been toying with the way of the artist I think of real artists you know we can ask ourselves what would Master Kim want he died recently God Rest his soul I think he would tell us to keep drawing and to enjoy the process he wouldn't want us to stop he wouldn't want any of us but whether we're on day one or day one million of our art Journeys he wouldn't want any of us to quit because of some kind of external circumstance or Bob Ross you know I can only guess at what Bob Ross would say but I think he would just remind us that we're each very special and he would encourage us to stay calm and experience the joy and adventure of painting when I thought of that I wrote this small thing and see what you think image making is merely the surface of what an artist does art is a way of life it's a method of observation and of conversation we document what is happening in a way that words cannot we make art to deepen our understanding of all things we keep ourselves open to what we are feeling and puts those emotions into our images creative work presents challenges and facing those challenges makes us grow stronger I do not envy those who have hacked their way to a result they are missing out on so much joy [Music] now that we're at the end of the video I want to remind you about the different places you can go to help the cause to take these legal issues to the highest authorities in the world which is exactly what we need to defend artists rights right now this is what's needed of us the situation requires each of us to step up and play our part and do our bits to protect our medium and all of the hard-working individuals that we benefit from in our medium they need our help now and we are privileged because we can do something about it new Discord group as well I am planning on setting up a new Discord group we need volunteers and we are also looking for artists who have been exploited and we are going to try and help as many artists as possible we need to come together as a community guys I can't do this all on my own I need your help but as a community we are powerful and strong when we come together so the link to that will be in the description where we tackle this problem I'm talking about inventive Solutions we need to be more creative than the prompters here guys because we're artists creativity is what we do that's the end of the video I hope this gave you Food For Thoughts I'm gonna go back to making my animation now goodbye
