TRANSCRIPT:

during this last lecture of the series i propose to say however rash it may seem what it is that the heart of romances appears to be to be i should like to go back again to a scene which i spoke of in the first and second lectures on this topic namely the old tradition which is at the heart of all western thought for at least 2 000 years and more before the middle of 18th century that particular attitude those particular beliefs which it appears to be romanticism attacked and gravely damaged namely the old proposition that virtue is knowledge a proposition which is was enunciated i suppose for the first time explicitly by socrates in the pages of plato and which is common to him into the christian tradition what kind of knowledge one may disagree about one there are battles between one philosopher and another one religion and another one scientist and another between religion and science between religion and art between every kind of attitude and every kind of school of thought and every other but the battle is invaluable but what is that true knowledge of reality the possession of which makes it possible for men to know what to do how to fit in the proposition that there is a nature of things such that if you know this nature and know yourself in relation to this nature and if there is a divinity if you know this divinity and understand the relationships between everything that composes the universe then your goals as well as the facts about yourself must become clear to you and you understand what it is that you should do if you are to fulfill yourself in the manner in which your nature cries out for and for this it is necessary to know whether the knowledge is the knowledge of physics or psychology or theology or some intuitive kind of knowledge individual or public whether it is confined to experts or maybe known by every man about all these things disagreement may occur but there is such a knowledge that is the foundation of the entire western tradition which they say romanticism attacked this is the view of the jigsaw puzzle of which we must fit in the fragments that is the view of the secret treasure which we beseek the essence of this view is there is a body of facts to which we must submit science is submission science is being guided by the nature of things scrupulous regard for what there is non-deviation from the nature of things understanding knowledge adaptation the opposite of this which is i think what the romantic movement proclaimed may be summarized under two heads one which we'll be familiar to from these lectures is the notion of the indomitable will not knowledge of values but the creation is what men do you create values you create goals you create ends and in the end you create your own vision of the universe exactly as artists create works of art and before the artist is created work of art it doesn't exist it isn't anywhere there is no copying there is no adaptation there is no learning of the rules there is no external check so to speak there is no structure which you must understand and adapt yourself to before you can proceed the heart of the entire process is invention creation making out of literally nothing or out of any materials that may be to hand and this most central aspect of this view is of course that your universe is as you choose to make it to some degree at any rate that is the philosophy that is to some extent the philosophy of shelling that is the insight indeed in our own day even of such psychologists as freud who maintain that the universe of people um possessed by one set of will illusions or possessed by another set of sentences it will be different from those possessed by another the second proposition is that there is no and it really is in some sense connected to the first is that there is no structure of things there is no pattern to which you must adapt yourself there is only if not the flow the endless self-creativity of the universe the universe must be conceived of not as a set of facts not as a pattern of events not as a collection of lumps in space three-dimensional entities bound together by certain unbreakable relations as for example talk to us by say physics chemistry and other natural sciences the universe is a process of perpetual forward self-trusting perpetual self-creation which can either be conceived of as hostile to man as say by shopping or even to some extent by nature which will overthrow all human efforts to check it to organize it to feel at home in it to make oneself some kind of cosy pattern in which one can rest either that or friendly because by identifying yourself with it by creating with it by throwing yourself into this great process indeed by discovering in yourself those very creative forces which you also discover outside by identifying on the one hand spirit on the other hand matter by seeing the whole thing as a vast self-organizing and self-creative process by doing this you will actually at last be free understanding is not the proper term to use because understanding throughout presupposes the understanding and the understood the noah and the known some kind of gap between the subject and the object but here there is no object there is only the subject in some sense create thrusting itself forward the subject may be the universe the subject may be the individual the subject may be the class the nation the church whatever is identified as the truest realities that speak in which the universe consists but in any case it is i say a process of perpetual forward creation and all schemas all generalizations all patterns put upon it are forms of distortion are forms of waking when words were said that the dissection is the murder this is approximately what he meant and he was much the mildest of those who expressed this particular point of to ignore this to invade it to attempt to see these things as in some sense submissive to some kind of intellectualization some sort of plan that to attempt to drop a set of rules or a set of laws or a formula and so forth is a form of self-indulgence or and in the end suicide or stupidity that at any rate is the sermon of the romantics wherever you try and understand anything by whatever powers you have you will discover as i tried to say last time you will discover that what you are pursuing to what you are pursuing is inexhaustible that you are trying to catch the uncatchable that you are trying to apply a formula to something which evades your formula because whenever you try and nail it down new abyss is open and these are business open to get other abilities the only persons who have ever made sense of reality are those who understand to try and circumscribe these things to try and nail them down to try and describe them no matter how scrupulous is a vain task and this will be true not only of science which of course does this by means of the most rigorous generalizations of to the romantics the most external and empty kind but even those scrupulous writers those scrupulous describers of experience realists naturalists those those who belong to the school of um the flow of consciousness bruce tolstar the most gifted diviners of every movement of the human spirit even those to the extent to which they commit themselves to some kind of objective description whether by external inspection or the most subtle intersection the most subtle insight into the inner movements of the spirit so long as they labor under the illusion that it is possible once and for all to write down to describe to give any finality to the process which they are trying to catch which they are trying to nail down so long as this goes on unreadable results fantasy will result some attempt always to cage the uncageables they speak some attempt always to pursue some kind of truth when there is no truth to try and stop the unceasing flow to catch movement by means of rest to catch time by means of space to catch life by means of darkness that is the romantic summon and when they ask themselves how then one could begin to understand reality in some sense the word understanding how one might obtain some kind of insight into this without positively distinguishing oneself on the one hand of the subject and distinguishing it as an object without the process killing it the answer which they sought to give at least some of them was that the only way of doing this was by means of myths by means of these symbols which i tried to speak last time because myths embody within themselves something you know uninarticulable and also somehow managed to encapsulate the dark the irrational the inexpressible that which in some way conveys the deep darkness of this whole process by images which themselves carry you to further images in which themselves point in some infinite direction that is attenuate what the germans who i think are responsible for this this whole outlook in the end uh preached the greeks for them understood life because apollo and dionysus were symbols they were myths who at one at the same time conveyed certain properties and yet if you ask yourself what it is that apollo stands for what it is that dionysus wants they attempt to spell this out in a finite number of words or even paint a finite number of pictures was plainly an absurdity and therefore in some sense myths are at one at the same time images which the mind can contemplate in relative tranquility and yet also something which is everlasting follows each generation transforms itself of the transformation of men and is in some sense an inexhaustible supply of the relevant images which are at once static and eternal but these images the greek images are dead for us for we are not greeks that's much harder the notion of returning to dionysus or returning to odin is absurd therefore we must have modern myths thus and since there are no modern myths because science has killed them or attenuated made the atmosphere unprofessional to them we must create them and so there is a conscious process of mismaking and we get in the early 19th century all this conscientious and painful effort to construct myths perhaps not to paint what they have some of it could be described as per genius the effort to construct myths which shall serve us in the way in which the old myths serve the greeks the roots of life are lost in darkness said um wilhelm schwager and the magic of life rests on insoluble mystery and this is what the myths must somehow incorporate the romantic art that is brother friedrich is a perpetual becoming without ever attaining of perfection nothing can come its depths it alone is infinite alone free its first law is the will of the creator is the will of the creator the will of the creator that knows no law all art is an attempt to evoke by symbols the inexpressible vision of the unceasing activity which is life this is what i've attempted to convey now that is how hamlet for example becomes a myth that is how don quixote becomes a myth that is how faust becomes a myth what shakespeare would have said about the extraordinary literature which was accumulated around hamlet what cervantes would have said about the extraordinary um adventures which were quick that it had from the early 19th century onwards i don't know but at any rate these things were converted into rich sources of mythology and if their inventors knew nothing about it so much the better the assumption was the author cannot know what dark depths he plans mozart cannot tell what genius it is that inspires him indeed so far he can tell his genius probably to that extent dries up and that i think if you wish for a very vivid illustration of the mismaking capacity of the early 19th century which is really the heart of the romantic movement the attempt to break reality into fragments to get away from the structure of things to say the unfavorable and so on the history of the opera don giovanni of moses don giovanni is quite an apt illustration as everyone who has heard it knows the opera ends or almost ends with the destruction of don giovanni by the infernal forces after he fails to reform after he fails to repent sunday is heard and he's swallowed up by the forces of hell at the end of which after he has been followed up and the smoke on the stage was cleared there is a success on the part of the remaining characters in the drama who then think of a very pretty little six set about um how extended it is that don giovanni has been destroyed while they are alive and happy and proposed to seek a perfectly peaceful and contented and ordinary life in each in his own session mazzetto is going to marry the leader will go back to our convent foreign will find a new master octavio will marry done under answer in the 19th century this perfectly harmless success was one of the most charming of murder species was regarded by the public as blasphemous and was therefore never performed it was first reintroduced into the european referees as far as i know by mala towards the end of the 90s the beginning of the 20th century and is now regularly played the reason is this here is this vast and dominating sinister symbolic figure don giovanni who stands we know not for watch but certainly for something inexpressible he stands perhaps for art as against life he stands perhaps for some principle of inexhaustible evil against some kind of philistine god he stands for power he stands for magic he stands with some kind of infernal forces of a superhuman kind and the tragedy the opera ends with an enormous climax in which one infernal force is followed by another and this vast melodrama rises to volcanic timax which is meant to cow the audience and show them amid spot and an unstable about a terrifying world they live and then suddenly this philistine little piece this success which follows in which the characters simply peacefully think about the fact that a rake has been punished and good men will continue their life that ordinary that's the peaceful life that after this was regarded as in artistic shallow pathetic and disgusting and therefore eliminated now this elevation of don giovanni into a vast myth which dominates over us which must somehow be interpreted in a way to convey some kind of the profoundest and most inexpressible aspects of the terrifying nature of reality it was certainly very far from the thoughts of the liberties and probably very fast from the thoughts of mercury the greatest lorenzo de ponte who started life as a converted drew in venice and ended it i think as a music teacher in philadelphia i was certainly a very remote from any sort of places on the stage one of the great ones the vast symbols of spiritual existence on earth but in the nineteenth century this was the airstrike taking towards don giovanni and he continued to haunt the mines of the 19th century haunted kyrgyzstan to a very profound degree and he haunted the minds of the 19th century and indeed does so to the president until the present day this is very very typical example of the total reversal of values of the complete transformation of something which started off by being dry classical symmetrical and in every respect in accordance with the conventions of the age it was something which burst its frame and suddenly begins to spread its wings in the most unaccustomed and and and fearful the this particular view of speak of of great images dominating and kind of of dark forces the unconscious and the importance of the inexpressible and the necessity of discounting it and allowing for it spreads into every sphere of human activity by no means confined to art it certainly enters into other spheres it enters for example into politics first in a mild way in works great images of the society great society of the dead and the living of those not yet born bound together by myriad in in the unanalyzable stands to which we're loyal so that every attempt to try to rationally analyze it say as a social contract or stay in some kind of utilitarian arrangement for the purpose of living a happier life or preventing collisions with human beings every such attempt is shallow and betrays the inner the inexpressible spirits which dominates any human association which carries it forward loyalty to which spiritual immersion in which is at the very heart of true genuine deep devoted human life then miller who is a german disciple of work um it really reaches its most eloquent form let me read it to you science says i can only reproduce a lifeless state by stating the political state death cannot represent life nor can stagnation that is the social contract the liberal state is what he means the english state in particular north stagnation movement science utilitarianism the use of machinery that does not convey the state that conveys a mere factory an insurance company a mercantile society not the intimate association of every physical and spiritual need of the whole of this physical and spiritual wealth of the totality of the internal and external life of a people into a great energetic instantly active and living home these mystical words then become the heart and center of the whole organic theory of political life and of loyalty to the state and of the state as a semi-spiritual organization which in a sense is symbolic of the spiritual powers of divine mystery which is very nearly what the state among the romantics it takes the extreme romantics and that it becomes it enters the sphere of law in the german school of historical jurisprudence the notion that true law is not that which a given person say king or say an assembly happens to pass which is simply an empirical event guided perhaps by utilitarian or other contemptible considerations it isn't that nor is it something eternal those laws of nature those divine laws which any rational soul can discover for itself as thoughts say by the roman church or as thoughts say by the stoics or as thoughts say by the 18th century french philosophers they may have disagreed about what these laws were or how to discover them but they all agreed that there were certain eternal immutable principles along which human life had to be founded adherence to which made men moral made men just and made men good this is denied law is the product of the beating force within the nation of dark traditional forces of its organic step which flows through its body like a tree of something which we cannot identify and cannot analyze but which everyone who is true to his country feels coursing through his veins therefore law is a traditional growth law is something which faster circumstances but partly the inner cell of the nation now beginning to be conceived as almost individual that which between them they in some sense generate and therefore true law is traditional law every nation has its own law every nation has its own shape and this shape goes far into the mystic past and its roots are somewhere in the darkness and unless it's roots in the darkness it is too easily overthrown the maestro who was the reaction of french catholic philosopher who i think only half believed in this organic role of life in as much as theoretically at least he had to do he he was he was apparent optimism the mess that says anything which man can make man command anything which man can create man can destroy therefore the only thing which is eternal is this mysterious frightening process which goes on far below the level of consciousness this is what creates traditions this is what creates states nations constitutions anything written anything articulated anything arrived at by sensible men in a cool hour is a thin superficial thing likely to collapse when other equally sane and equally superficial and equally reasonable men refuted and this therefore has no true basis in religion this is also true of historical theory certainly on the part of the great german historical school which again tries to trace historical evolution out of unconscious dark sectors into interweaving with each other in all kinds of inexplicable ways there is even such a thing as romantic economics in the form for example of the economics of men like fichten of list particularly in germany who believed in the necessity of say creating an isolated state to give us a hundred start an isolated state in which the true spiritual force of the nation can exercise exercise itself without being buffeted by other nations that is to say where the purpose of the economics the purpose of money the purpose of trade is towards the spiritual self-perfection of man and does not obey so-called um unbreakable laws of economics which even people like burke believe birth believed said indeed that the laws of commerce and are the laws of nature and therefore the laws of god and deduced from this that nothing could be done about passing any radical reform and the poor would have to starve this is approximately this this was as you know um one of the consequences which led which which led the legislative school of economics into a certain amount of justice justified disrepute the romantic um economics is precise opposite of this all economic institutions must be bent towards some kind of ideal of living together in a spiritually progressive manner and above all you mustn't make the mistake of supposing that there are external laws and there are some kind of objective given laws of economics which in some way are beyond human control this is a typical return to the rerun this means once again you believe in a structure of things which can be studied which sits still while you look at it and describe it and this is false any such assumption that there are objective laws is simply a human fantasy a human invention an attempt on the part of human beings to justify their conduct and particularly their disreputable conduct by calling into being by placing the responsibility upon the shoulders of imaginary external laws such as the laws of supply and demand or in any other kind of external laws this law of politics that law of economics which is alleged to be unalterable and which therefore in some way not only explains but justifies the poverty scholar and other unattractive social phenomena the romantic in this respect could be either progressive or reactionary in what might be called revolutionary states the radical states created after the french revolution they were reactionary they called that for some kind of medieval darkness in reactionary states say prussia after 1812 they became progressive in as much as they regarded this artificial creation of the king of prussia as a suffocating artificial mechanism which stifled the natural organic thrust of the life of the human beings imprisoned by it so it could take either form that is why we get revolutionary romantics and reaction romantics that's why that is why it's impossible to pin romanticism down to any given political view however often this has been tried this i think is the fundamental i think those are the fundamental um bases of romanticism will and the emptiness to speak of outer space the fact that there is no structure to things that you can really mold these things as you will they only come into being as a result of your building activity and therefore opposition to any jew which tried to represent reality as having some kind of form which could be studied written down learned communicated to others and in other respects treated in a scientific manner there is no problems in which i think this particular attitude is more evident than the field of music about which i have not yet spoken it's interesting and indeed even amusing to watch the development of issues towards music from the beginning of the 18th to roughly speaking in the middle of the 19th century in the 18th century particularly in france music is regarded as honor in syria art vocal music has its place because it heightens the importance of the words religious music has its place because it contributes to the mood which religion is meant to induce but uh it is clear for example well the end of the 17th century says that it is obvious that the visual art is far more sensitive to the spiritual life of man than for example the ear fontenelle who was the most civilized man of his time and indeed of most times said when instrumental music first began to invade france and sonata began to appear as against the kind of vocal religious music or operatic music to which he was used which had a plot which had explanation which had some kind of extra musical importance when sanasas appeared he said what do you want of me and condemned instrumental music as a meaningless pattern of science not rarely suitable for delicate or civilized ears the perhaps this is this is a fairly common attitude in france in the middle certainly in the middle of 18th century it comes out with particular vividness in the verses addressed by the atheist and dramatist mar montel in the 70s um to the composer who at this period conquered the paris stage look as everyone knows reform music by placing music above the words and by forcing the words so to speak into some conformity with the true emotion and drama which he wished to convey by means of the music he didn't um he the great musical reform of no longer using music as a mere accompaniment to the meaning of the actual dramatic words this outrage vermonter who suppose drama was supposed all art to have some kind of mimetic quality that is to say imitation of life imitation of the ideals of life imitation of imaginary beings ideal beings not necessarily real beings but still some kind of imitation some kind of relationship to actual events actual persons actual emotions something which was there in reality which was the business of the artist it's necessary to idealize but it's any way to represent as it truly is and music which had no meaning by itself or simply its exception of sounds was clearly non-memetic everybody saw that words had something to do with the words spoken in ordinary life paints had something to do with colors perceived in nature but sounds were very dissimilar to the sounds heard in wrestling forests or auto or to bird song the kind of sounds which musicians used were clearly a much remoter from any kind of ordinary human experience than where the materials used by other artists hence he attacked look in the following words so if we give the english version first then i shall read the fetch he has arrived this mountain bank from bohemia he has arrived preceded by his reputation upon the ruins of a superb perm he makes achilles and agamemnon howl he makes queen triton lester scream he makes the independable indefensible orchestra snow iran this is a very typical um attack of its it's time by no means uncharacteristic this is approximately the attitude of those who didn't wish to give up association with nature or the idea of imitation to this peculiar notion of mere expression of the inner cell this is true about fontan writing in 1785. for him the only purpose of music is to evoke certain emotions unless it evokes some kind of emotions which are already there unless it is reminiscent of something unless it is in some sense associated with experience of some kind it has no value certainly sounds as such expressed nothing and need never be employed in this particular way madame the star very typically already in the beginning of the 19th century speaking about music which allegedly thought to be extremely fun said something this thought the value of music relies in the following what man she says exhausted by a life of passion can listen with indifference to the tunes of his tranquil youth what woman whose beauty time has at last ravaged can hear without emotion the song that i love i once sang well now that this is true but this is a very very very different type of approach to music from that which was already being stressed by the romantic germans of this particular period even standard who like rossini with an almost physical passion says about the music of beethoven that he detests these combinations um he detests the combinations of this learned and almost mathematical harmony rather the sort of thing which people nowadays might be inclined to say about say srendrik this is very different from vacant rhoda who wrote in 1795. music shows us all the movements of our spirit disembodied aura schopenhauer who says the musician reveals to us the intimate essence of the world he is the interpreter of the profoundest wisdom speaking a language which reason cannot understand neither reasons nor indeed anything else it speaks better shopping our point because in some sense this music was the expression of the naked will of that internal energy which moves the world of that inexpressible inner drive or will which in fact is the essence for him of reality and which all other us to some extent try to tame order arrange organize and to that extent cut into distort and kill and this of course is also the view of geek and of schlegel and of all the romantics we indeed somehow very fond of music and there are there are essays by hustling not only remarkable racism remarkable but also remarkable essays on the actual significance and cosmic metaphysical significance let us say of the tonic in the fifth which are described as vast giants and glittering arms he also has a little essay on the true significance of for example the court of asia minor which is a very unlikely thing a that period have been written about by any member of any other european nation this then is fixing the attitude towards music which is abstract detached from life direct expression non-memetic non-immediate and at the furthest possible end to any kind of objective description of anything nevertheless of course they didn't think that the arts ought to be unbridled that one should simply sing whatever comes with one's head paint whatever the mood charges want to paint or give absolutely completely undisciplined um expressions of the emotions they were child they've been charged with this by professor irving david and others but mistakenly um schlegel says very clearly once i'm sorry says very clearly when storms rage and he is bewildered and confused gibberish results a person must not wander idly all day in search of feelings and images he must certainly he must have receiving images certainly he must plainly allow these songs to rage for her indeed can you avoid it but then he must discipline it then you must find the proper medium for that expression trubert said that the mark of a great composer is to be caught in a vast battle of inspiration in which the forces rage in the most uncontrolled way and then to keep one's head in the course of the storm and direct the troops this is the sound practically a far more genuine expression of what artists do than the remarks of the more unbridled romantics who i think were unaware of the nature of art in as much as they were not artists themselves who were these persons who so celebrated the will who so hated the fixed nature of reality and who believed in these storms and these untameable these unbridgeable abysses and these unorganizable fields it's very difficult to give any sociological explanation although it ought to be done for the right of the romantic movement the only explanation that i've ever been able to discover is by looking at who these persons were particularly in germany and the truth of course is that they were remarkably unworldly body of men they were poor they were timid they were bookish they were very awkward in society they were easily snubbed they had to serve as tutors to great men they were constantly full of insult and oppression it's clear that in some sense they were confined and contracted in the universe they were like diedro's description of the bench twig which always always jumped back and hit its benders to speak and that is i think what is on the whole true of these germans was something perhaps about prussia where most of them came from about this excessively protagonistic state of freddie the great about the fact that he was a mercantilist and therefore increased the wealth of prussia increased her army made her most powerful and rich of all the german states but at the same time popularized her presence and did not allow sufficient opportunity to most of our citizens it is true too that these men most of them children of clergymen of civil servants and the like received education which made of them gave them certain intellectual and emotional ambitions which endured the fact that too many jobs were perhaps held by persons of good birth in prussia where social distinctions were preserved in the most rigorous manner because they weren't able to obtain full expression of their ambitions did perhaps become somewhat frustrated and began to breed fantasies of every possible kind there is something in there at any rate it seems to me to be a more reasonable explanation that this should have been the case that men of a humiliated kind excited perhaps by the french revolution and by the general overtime events should have given rise to this then the theory of music who thinks that the movement really began in france among ladies and it's really due to um the effects upon the nerves of the consumption of too much tea and coffee of corsets which were too tight of cosmetics which were poisonous and of other means of self-beautification which had physically dignitarious results this doesn't appear to be on the whole theory which is worth pursuing very much further attenuate anyways the the movement rose in germany is a rose in germany and there it found its story's home but it traveled it traveled certainly beyond the confines of germany it traveled to every country where there was some kind of social discontent section particularly the countries oppressed by small elites of brutal or oppressive or inefficient women particularly in eastern europe and it found its home perhaps it found its most passionate expression of all in of all countries england where baron certainly was the leader of the entire romantic movement in the sense of baroness who became almost synonymous with romanticism in the early 19th century where byron speaks how badly became a romantic is too long a story which i don't think i can even attempt to tell even if i knew it but there is no doubt that he is a person perhaps best described by chateaubriand who said the ancients scarcely knew the secret anxiety the bitterness of strangled passions all fermenting uselessly a large political life games in the gymnasium or in the field of mars the business of the forum public business filled our time and left no place for the balling and destructive unui of the heart that i think is certainly about his condition and i think chateaubriand who was only perhaps half a romantic only a romantic in the sense that he was subjective and introspective and try to make a kind of vague myth out of christian values to replace the no longer available myths of the ancient world in the middle ages which chateaubriand seems to me to have described ethically chatobia is respectful and half ironical towards this movement perhaps the best expression of it it was given by a little french jingle which i should now read you written by an anonymous period at the beginning of the 19th century lobbies obedience is switched to the vile heart of the catholic they always have someone as a model out of the law an artist must only listen to his own self and pride alone fills the romantic house this is certainly the position of baron in the emotional and indeed political world of the 19th century the byron's chief emphasis is upon the indomitable will and the whole philosophy of volunteerism the whole philosophy of the fact that there is a world which must be subdued and subjugated by superior persons who really takes its right from him to the french romantics from hugo onwards are very in a certain sense disciples of bahrain baron and greta are the great names but goethe was very ambiguous romantic and although in faust he created somebody who keeps saying forward forward never stop never cease never ask the moment to wait over murder over crime over every conceivable obstacle the romantic spirit must forge its way although gertie said that his later works and his life belied it baron acted his beliefs in the most convincing session let me read you typicalized the baron was really entered into european consciousness and in a certain sense infected the entire imaging movement apart he stalked in joyless reverie with pleasure drugged he almost longs the world and ian for change of scene and ian the shade the shade by which he means death there was in him a vital scorn of all his sort of stranger in this breathing world this is the typical note of the outcast the exile the superman the man who cannot put up with the existing world because he's so large to contain it because he has ideals which in some sense presuppose the necessity of perpetual servant movement forward which is constantly confined by the stupidity of the unimaginativeness and the flatness of the existing world therefore the career the lives of iranians are byronic figures begin in scorn pass into vice from there to crime to terror and to despair that is the odd nicara of all these jawas and laras and cains who filled his furniture so much he saw beyond or sunk beneath the man with whom he felt condemned to breathe my spirit walks not for the fails of men this is meant for it nor looked upon the earth with human eyes the theft of their ambition was not mine the aim of their existence was not mine my joy my greeks my passions and my powers made me a stranger now the whole of the byronic syndrome speak consists in adhesion to these two propositions or rather two values which i tried to expand one of which is the will and the other of which is the absence of a structure of the world to which one must in some sense make one adjust themselves and from there it passes to others from bahrain it passes to la martin to victor hugo to the french romantic to no gay to the french romantics in general from them it goes further to schopenhauer who sees man as being tossed in a kind of frail bark upon a vast ocean of the will which has no purpose which has no end which has no direction which man can only resist at his own peril but with which men can come to terms only if he somehow manages to rid himself of this unnecessary desire to order unnecessary desire to tidy himself up unnecessary desire to create a cozy home for himself in this wild and unpredictable element that is the only way in which you can do it from shopping it goes to wagner who again whose whole sermon in the ring for example is the appalling nature of unsatisfiable desire which must lead to the most fearful suffering and ultimately to the immolation in the most violent session of all those who are possessed by a desire which they can at one at the same time neither avoid nor satisfy and the result of which must be some kind of ultimate extinction ultimate the waters of the rhine rise and cover this violence this chaotic this unstoppable this incurable disease from which all mortal by which all mortals are affected that i think is the heart of the romantic movement in europe now let me go back now and consider again um what the position is with regard to that long catalogue which i attempted to read during the first of these lectures in the course of which i tried to show that romanticism appeared on the surface to say everything in its opposite it appears to me that if i'm right at all then perhaps it is possible to maintain that these two principles the necessity of the will and the absence of a structure of things may satisfy most of these criteria and that the contradictions which appeared so stringent then are not perhaps quite surviving as they may seem to appear to begin with if you begin for example with the notion of the fact that it's by which professor um lovejoy complained to bitterly how can it be that the word romanticism stands at one at the same time for two such contradictory things as on one hand noble savages primitivism the simple life rosy cheek peasants away from the frightful sophistication of the cities and towards smiling prairies of of of of them the united states um or some other simple form of life in some existence or non-existent part of the globe on the one hand that and on the other hand blue wigs green hair upset and uh pulling his lobster along the streets of paris in order to attract some degree of attention to himself which indeed he succeeded in doing they if you ask what is common to these two and professor lovejoy quite naturally expresses a certain surprise that the same word should be comfortably used for those what is common to them both is that they both wish to break up the nature of the given in the 18th century you have a sophisticated form of life you have scheme an extreme order of sophistication you have forms you have rules you have laws you have etiquette you have an extremely tight and well organized form of life whether in the arts or in politics or in any other sphere anything which destroys this anything which blows it up is welcome and therefore whether you go to the isle of the blessed whether you go to the noble indians whether you go to the simple uncorrupted heart of the simple man as sun by rousseau on the one hand or whether you go to green wigs and blue waistcoats and then of wild distempers and the people with most extreme sophistication heavy bohemianism of life whichever of these you go to attenuate both these are methods of blowing up the given of shattering that which is given just as in hofmann the fact that brass knockers become old women or old women become city councillors or city councillors become build a punch it's not simply meant to titillate your feelings not simply meant to be a slightly fantastic kind of story which which gives pleasure it's immediately forgotten just as evil and goggles say the story of the nose the fact that a nose detaches itself from the face of a minor civil servant and then has romantic adventures of a very violent kind in the top half in the great coach he's not merely meant to be a rather peculiar story but he's somehow meant to be an invasion of an attack upon the hideous nature of the unalterable given the fact that you wish to show that underneath this smooth surface there are frightful inexpressible forces boiling that and that nothing can be taken for granted and the profound view of life essentially entails the breaking of this mirror-like surface so in the case of romanticism whichever way you turn whether it is towards extreme sophistication or some unheard of simplicity the results will be the same of course if you think that you actually can become a noble savage if you think that you actually can transform yourself into a simple native of some unsophisticated country living a very primitive life then the magic is gone but none of them did the whole point of the romantic vision of the noble savage was that he was unattainable if he was attainable he was useless that is certainly true because then he becomes this awful given this frightful rule of life which is just as confining just as disciplining just as detestable as that which it replaces and therefore the unfindable the unattainable the infinite and so forth these are the hearts of the matter similarly for example if you ask what is common to the entrance and the phantoms and the griffins and the moats and the wrestling and the ghosts and the dribbling deaths which surround medieval castles and the the ghosts of bloody hands and the faithful the dark voices which reach you from all kinds of mysterious and terrifying ravines and so forth what is the common to these and let us say the great spectacle of the peaceful organic middle ages with its tournaments heralds and its priests and its royal personnel and its aristocracy quiet dignified unalterable and essentially at peace with itself people say what is common to both these and both these are of course stuck in trade romantic writers the answer is both these things is placed alongside the daily reality of a beginning of an early industrial civilization in lyon or in birmingham in some sense compromise it let's say even scott let us take the extraordinary case of scott here is the writer commonly accounted as romantic in a sense you may ask as indeed a number of marxist marxists critics do ask why is scott's a romantic writer scott is simply an extremely imaginative and scrupulous writer who managed to describe with considerable fidelity in a way to affect all kinds of historians the life of ageless preceding his own say 17th century scotland say in the 13th century england say 15th century france and so forth why is this romantic well by itself it wouldn't be naturally it was simply a very um faithful scrupulous medieval historian simply describing the exact customs of your ancestors you are simply being a historian in the best classical tradition and you are simply telling the truth as well you are able and this is indecently romantic but on the country highly reputable academic activity but scott was a romantic writer why was this simply because he liked these forms of life that is not quite enough the point is that by painting these very attractive and delightful and hypnotic pictures of these ages he placed alongside our values by which i mean the values of 1810 the values of 1820. the values of his own contemporary scotland or in contemporary england or france which were what they were which were the values of the early 19th century by the side of these values whatever they may have been protestant unromantic industrial attenuate not medieval by the side of these he placed another set of values equally good if not better in competition with these and this in some sense shattered the monopoly shattered the possibility of the fact that every age is as good as it can be and is indeed advancing to an even better one if you ask the difference in macaulay and scott you will see it precisely in this but macaulay really does believe in progress if it is everything fits into its own place and the 17th century was less fortunate in the 18th and the 18th much less luckier than the 19th everything is all right where it is everything can be explained in terms of its own causal forces and we are progressing everything fits everything advances at a certain cost it may be but at the same time if it were not for human stupidity human idleness human perversity and other dark forces vested interests and alike we should be progressing much faster this he had in common to some degree with james mill and the utilitarians he believes that bacon did not believe in mystical religions now that is a picture whereby you say there is a reality it has a certain nature we study it we are scientific we know more now than we used to know before they didn't know how to become happier we know it better we don't do it perfectly but we know it better and our answers are descendants will know better still whether we ever get to the goal of a perfectly perfect society stable unalterable with all human possible natural human wishes tilted is satisfied in a harmonious manner nobody can tell but it is not an absurd ideal this is the jigsaw puzzle solved if scott is right this cannot be true this is like have that again if there are values in the past which are more valuable than those of the present or at least in competition with them if there is a magnificent civilization somewhere there in 13th century britain or in some remote part of the world whether in space or in time which is as attractive if not more so than the drab civilization in which we are living but nevertheless and that is the important thing irreproducible you cannot get to it it can't be rebuilt it must remain a dream it must remain a fantasy it must remain an object of disappointment if you seek it if that is so then nothing will satisfy you because two ideals have come into collusion and it is impossible to solve the condition it's impossible to obtain a state of affairs which will contain the best of all these cultures because they're not compatible and therefore the notion of incompatibility of plurality of ideals each of which has its own validity becomes part of the great battering realm which romanticism employs against the notion of order against the notion of progress against the notion of perfection classical ideals the structure of things and so forth that is why scott surprisingly enough is correctly called a romantic writer no universal pattern no great style nalini brain of which jesus folks the real line the true the the underground traditions to which mr ts eliot wish to penetrate these are the things which are denied and denounced by the entire romantic movement from the beginning to the end as a fearful delusion only likely to lead to stupidity and shallowness on the part of those who pursue it this is nature methodized this is hopes nature methodized this is aristotle this is what the romantics most bitterly detested and therefore one must break up this order one must break it up against the past or by going within oneself and out of the external world or one must go and seek to be one with some kind of great spiritual drive which one will never completely identify oneself with or one must somehow idealize some myth which will never quite come to pass and no dickmas or a southern miss or a celtic myth or some other yes it doesn't matter which class or nation or church or whatever it may be which will constantly drive you forward and which will never be fulfilled and the essence and daniel which is that it is strictly unfulfillable so that if it were fulfilled it would be worthless that i think is the heart and essence of the romantic movement so far they can see will and the life as not as as a man as an activity as something which cannot be described because it is perpetually creating you mustn't even say itself for the reason yourself there is only movement that i think is the heart of the romantic movement now something perhaps ought to be said about its consequences about its consequences almost in the present day and it has certainly happened it is sent to a very vast degree but of course it was met by certain counterforces which to some extent softened the blow for there is no doubt whatever else may be said about romanticism that he did put his thing i said to speak up on something which classicism had left out upon these unconscious dark forces upon the fact that the classical description of men and the description of men by scientists or scientifically influenced men such as helveticians let's say or james mill or h.d wells or shaw or russell is not the whole name there are certain aspects of human existence particularly the inward aspect of human life which were totally left out and which never distorted the picture in a very valid degree one of the movements certainly which is led to in the present is the so-called existentialist movement about which i should like to say a few words for essentially it seems to me certainly the truest era of romanticism before i speak of it let me explain what i think to be certain common qualities for the great achievement of romanticism and that which i started my lectures was that unlike most other great movements in human history it literally succeeded in transforming certain of our values to a very profound degree that is what made existentialism possible let me first speak about these values and then i should attempt to show how it penetrates this modern philosophy and how it enters into certain other phenomena of modern life as well such as for example the emotive theory of ethics or fascism each of which it is profoundly influenced i think i mentioned already but i think i just now put greater stress on the fact that a new cluster of virtues appeared with the romantic movement since we are wills and since we are must be free in the country of 15 cents motive counts more than consequence for consequences cannot be controlled but motives can since we must be free and since we must be ourselves to the fullest possible degree the great virtue the greatest virtue of all in the sense is what extensionists call authenticity and what the romantics called sincerity now as i tried to say before this is you i don't believe that in the 17th century as i think i said joe if you had a religious conflict between say a protestant and a catholic it would have been possible for the catholic to say the protestant is a damnable heretic and lead souls to perdition but the fact that he's sincere raises him in my estimation the fact that he's sincere that he's prepared to lay down his life for the nonsense which he believes is a morally noble sect and that anyone should speak who is sufficiently a man of integrity anyone who is prepared to sacrifice himself upon any altar no matter what has a moral personality which is worthy of respect no matter how detestable or how false the ideals to which he bows his knee the notion of idealism as i say is new idealism means that you respect people for the threats that prepare to give up health wealth popularity power all kinds of desirable things which their emotions demand which speaks to that which they can't control themselves what can't call the external factors emotions which are themselves part of the psychological or physical world that people are prepared to lay that aside for the sake of something with which they truly identify themselves no matter what and the notion that idealism is a good thing and realism a bad one and that i think i said to you before if i say i am something of a realist you now mean i'm about to tell a lie or do something peculiar that sense of realism is the result of a romantic movement namely that sincerity becomes a virtue in itself and while it's and this i think is the other heart of the whole thing the fact that there is admiration from the 1820s onwards for minorities as such for defiance as such for failure as being nobler in certain respects and success for every kind of opposition to reality for what is called taking up positions on principle where the principle made itself be absurd that this in some way is not regarded with the kind of contempt with which will regard say a man who says tries to is seven which is also a principle but which nevertheless you know to be the assertion of something false insignificant because what romanticism did was to undermine the notion that in matters of value politics morals aesthetics there are such things as objective criteria which operate within human beings such that anyone who doesn't use these criteria is simply either a liar or a magnet which is true state of mathematics or physics and this division between where objective truth obtains say mathematics say physics say certain regions of common sense and where objective truth has been compromised say ethics say aesthetics and so forth that i think is new and that i think has created a new attitude to life whether good or bad i will not volunteer to say that is to say if you ask yourself for example um what kind of moral evaluation you would give to certain historical personalities i don't know let's just say you compare um utilitarian persons who utilitarian figures have considered benefits of mankind say freddie the great or or or let us say whom about whom you might think that their private characters were not irreproachable about whom we might say that they were perhaps in certain respects hard-hearted or brutal or cruel or not at all free from certain um impulses which on the whole um human beings was approved at the same time there is no doubt they improved their lives of their people they were competent they were efficient they raised the level of life they created great organizations which have lasted and they have been the source of a great deal of satisfaction strength and happiness to a large number of persons on the one hand these and if on the other hand you compare them with say someone who obviously called suffering john of leiden who caused cannibalism to occur in the city of minister who caused a large number of people to be slaughtered for the sake of his own apocalyptic religion talk to a mother who let us say destroyed a very large number of persons whom today we should consider innocent for the sake of ourselves the purest possible motive supposing you ask yourself which of these persons you rate higher in the 18th century there would have been no doubt frederick the great clearly comes above a religious marathon today people would suffer from certain doubts they would suffer certain doubts because they think that idealism sincerity dedication purity of heart purity of mind are qualities preferable to corruption wickedness calculation algorithm the desire to exploit other people's abilities which these great state founders undoubtedly were guilty of and therefore we are in some sense children of both worlds the peculiar articular position is that we are heir to romanticism because romanticism broke that great single mold in which humanity in one way or another had marched to the two the philosophy of we are in some sense products of certain dots we can't quite tell we give so much so many marks for consequence so many amounts of motive and we oscillate between the two if it goes too far if someone is a is a hitler then we don't think that his sincerity isn't necessarily saving quality although in the 30s it was much argued in his favor at the same time but this he must go very far indeed and flout values which are of an extremely universal kind so that in some sense we are still members of some kind of unified tradition but the fields within which we now oscillate freely the amount of allowance we make is far far greater than it has ever been before and for this the romantic movement is too great degree responsible in as much as it preached the incompatibility of ideals the importance of motive the importance of character or attenuate of of speak of purpose over consequence over efficiency over effect over happiness success and um position in the world when hildeben said happiness happiness is not an ideal happiness is tipped water on the tongue when nietzsche said man does not desire happiness only the englishman does this was a very this was a sentiment which on the whole would not have been last yet in the 17th or 18th centuries at least i think not and i think this is perhaps the direct product of the romantic movement now as to existentialism the central terminal of essentialism is essentially a romantic one namely that um there is in the world nothing to lean on if you try and explain your conduct and you say simply for tomorrow it's too strong for me emotion overcame me or there are certain principles of an objective kind which i although i hate it i must subserve or i have received orders from an institution which is eternal or divine or which is of an objectively valid character and although i may not like it it has given the order it's being laws of economics it being um the ministry of the interior it being whatever it may be it has given the orders and it has a right to my validity once you begin doing this you are simply using anybody you are simply pretending that you are not deciding when in fact you have decided but don't care to face the consequences of the fact that it is you who have decided even when you say i am partially unconscious i am the product of unconscious forces i cannot help it i have a complex it is not my fault i am driven it is because my father was unkind to my mother that i am today the monster that i am this is broadly speaking and i think he's probably writing but this is broadly speaking an attempt to carry favor or to obtain sympathy by transferring the weight of responsibility for your ex in which you are entirely free to something objective it doesn't matter whether it's a political organization or a psychological doctrine but somewhere you are trying to shift responsibility from your shoulders of course it is you decided once you say you are a monster and don't mind being a monster everything here it's a kind of complacent acceptance of something which you know to be ideal but which of which will take the curse of all which will take a curse by saying not our society is responsible we're all determined we cannot help it there is a causarity which pervades the world and i am merely the instrument of powerful forces which i can no more prevent from making me evil and that can prevent making you good you are not to be congratulated being good nor am i condemned for being evil neither of us can help our state we are simply fragments of an enormous causal process sartre i think with a certain justice echoes the view of the fictitious rules of which is where it all comes from ultimately in saying that this is in some sense either self-deception or deliberate deception of others and the existentialists of course go further than this they say that the very notion of a metaphysical structure of the universe theology or metaphysics they attempt to say that certain things have essences which merely means things are what they are of necessity we arrive in a world which has a certain structure which cannot be altered physical structure chemical structure social structure psychological structure and metaphysical and theological structure with god at the head of this great creation and the amoeba below or whatever it is you may believe in these are nothing but pathetic attempts on the part of human beings to make themselves at home with the world by breeding enormous cozy sentences so that the world should be such that they should be able to fit into it more comfortably and shall not have to face the appalling prospect of total responsibility for all their acts upon their own shoulders and when they give motives to doing what they do when they say i have done this because of that because in order to pursue this and you say but why should you pursue this particular end and you say because it is objectively right that too for the existentialist is again an attempt to transfer responsibility of what should be a free choice in a vacuum onto something which is not yours which is objective natural law the sayings of the sages the pronouncements of sacred books the pronouncement of scientists and laboratory what psychologists and sociologists say what politicians or economists declare not i they and this is regarded as on the whole an attempt to shuffle off responsibility and to blind oneself and blind ones unnecessarily to the fact that the universe is in fact a kind of void that is what is meant by calling it absurd i can't avoid which you and you alone exist and you make whatever there is to make and you are responsible for making what you make and you cannot plead extenuation all excuses are false and all explanations are explaining the way and this might as well be faced by a man who is brave enough and tragic enough to face reality as he should this is the stoic servant of his essentialism and it derives directly from um from romanticism some romantics of course went too far by which i mean this let me give you the extraordinary example of sterner which i think will may perhaps lead us to see what it is in the end that is valuable in romanticism even for us now now was a german hegelian school master who argued quite correctly as follows the romantics are quite right in supposing that when we think that institutions are eternal this is a mistake institutions are created freely by human beings for the benefit of other human beings and in time become worn out and therefore by looking at them from the point of view of the present we see their worn out we must abolish them and have new institutions freely arrived at by our own indomitable will this is not merely true political institutions economic institutions or other public institutions it's equally true of doctrines doctrines can also be a most terrible weight upon us fearful chains and tyrannies which yoke us down to all kinds of jews which the present or our own wills no longer desirate but if it is true and therefore theory is still must be blown up any kind of general theory say hegel say marx is itself a ghostly form of despotism which claims to have some kind of objective validity beyond the choice of individual men this cannot be right for it confines us and crips us and limits our free activity but if this is true about doctrines it will be equally true of all general propositions but if it is true of all general propositions then and this is the last step of all which some romantic success you talk it's true of all words because all words are general they're all classified if i use the word yellow i want to mean by what i meant by it yesterday and what you will mean by tomorrow and this of course is a terrible yoke this is a fearful despotism why should the word yellow mean the same thing now and tomorrow why can't i alter it why you should try to always make four why should words be uniform why can't i make up my own universe each time i begin but of course if i do that then if there is no systematic symbolism i can't think and if i can't think i'll go mad and to do him justice stephen and ended his life very honorably very consistently in the lunatic asylum the perfect peaceful harmless lunatic somewhere in the middle sixties but something the thought was also boiling in the mind of nature with the far superior thinker but who in certain respects resembles sterna and from this i think a model may be drawn namely that so long as we live in society we we communicate those with whom we if we did not communicate we should hardly be men among the definitions of what we mean by human being is someone who understands attenuated portion of what we say to him to this degree then there must be some degree of common uh common values common language common communication and some degree of common values otherwise there will be no intelligibility between human beings but a human being cannot understand what any other human being says is scarcely human being he's on the whole pronounced abnormal to the extent to which there is normality there is and there is communication there are common values to the extent to which there are common values it is impossible to say everything must be created by me if i find something given smash it if i find something structured destroyed in order to give free play to my unbridled imagination and to this extent romanticism if it's driven to its logical conclusion does certainly end in some kind of lunacy in a certain sense fascism too is an inheritor of romanticism and that is inherited not because it is irrational plenty of movements have been left or because we believe no leaks plenty of movements have been dead the reason why fascism owes something to romanticism is again because of this notion of the unpredictable will either of a man or of a group which forges forward in some impossible to organize impossible to predict impossible to rationalize fashion that is the whole hearts that speak in a certain sense of fascism that is the whole heart the whole heart of terrorism was what the leader will say tomorrow how the spirit will move us where we should go what we should do that cannot be foretold the hysterical element the historical self-assertion and the narcissistic destruction of existing institutions because they confined the un unlimited will which is the only thing which counts for human beings the superior person who crushes the inferior because he's really stronger that is direct inheritance in an extremely distorted garbage formula that is still an inheritance from these romantics of whom i have been speaking and this certainly has played an extremely powerful part in our lives the whole thing indeed is an attempt to impose an aesthetic muscle upon reality to say everything should obey the rules of art if you are an artist and perhaps some of these propositions which i've tried to utter during the last six lectures have a great deal of validity their attempt to convert life into art presupposes that human beings are stuff the presupposes they are simply in some sense material even if paints or sounds are material and to the degree to which this is not true to the degree to which human beings in order to communicate with each other are forced to recognize certain common values are forced to recognize certain common facts are forced to live in a common world to the extent to which not everything which science says is is nonsense not everything which common sense declares is untrue but to say that is in itself a self-contradictory and absurd proposition to this extent romanticism in its full form and even its offshoots in the form of both existentialism and the fascism seemed to me to be fallacious let me end on one further note what may we can be said we owe to romanticism well we are a great deal to it we owe the notion of the freedom of the artist and the fact that he neither he nor human beings in general can be explained by oversimplified jews such as the president of the 18th century and such as still enunciated by over-rational and over-scientific and the risks of either human beings or groups we owe i think we owe to romanticism also the notion that a unified answer to human affairs is likely to be ruinous that if human beings if you really believe that there is one single solution to all human ills and this solution you must impose at no matter what cost you are likely to become a violent and despotic tyrant in the name of your solution because your desire to remove all obstacles to it will end by destroying those creatures for whose benefit you you offer the solution the notion that there are many values that are incompatible the whole notion of serenity the whole notion of inexhaustibility the whole notion of the in some sense imperfection of all sorts of arrangements the notion that no single answer which claims to be perfect and true whether in art or in life can in principle the perfect social that i think we certainly owe the romantics and so another security situation has arisen here are the romantics whose chief burden is to destroy ordinary tolerant life to destroy psyllidism to destroy common sense to destroy peaceful evocations of men to raise everybody to some passionate level of self expressive experience of such a kind as perhaps any divinities in the older works of man were supposed to exercise this is the ostensible um sermon the sensible purpose of romanticism whether among the germans of whom i speak or in bahrain or among the french or whoever it may be this is and yet as a result of making clear the existence of preventative values by the result of driving wedges into the notion of the classical idea of the single answer to all questions of the rationalizability of everything of the unstability of all questions of the whole jigsaw puzzle conception of life by doing this they have as it were put forward prominently and laid emphasis upon the incompatibility of human ideals and if these ideas are compatible then human beings sooner or later realize that they must make do they must make compromises because if they seek to destroy others others will seek to destroy them with the result that as a result of this passionate fanatical half-mad doctrine we have appreciation of the necessity of tolerating others the necessity of preserving an imperfect equilibrium in human affairs the impossibility of driving human beings so far into the pen which we have created for them or into the single solution which possesses us that they will ultimately revolt against us or attenuate the crushed side so the result of romanticism is liberalism toleration decency and the appreciation of the imperfections of life some degree of increased if you like rational self-understanding this certainly was very very far from the intentions of romanticism but at the same time so far as romantic doctrine is true they are the persons who most strongly emphasize the unpredictability of all human activities and in their own particular case that hoisted their own petals aiming at one thing they produced fortunately for us all almost the exact opposite thank you very much i'm most grateful to you for having the patients to listen to these six long lectures
