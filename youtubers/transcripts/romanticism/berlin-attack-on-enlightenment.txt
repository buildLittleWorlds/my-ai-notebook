TRANSCRIPT:

last time i said that i would speak today about the attack delivered on the ideal of the enlightenment attenuate the beginning of it i think it would be only fair to tell you what the general program of these lectures is to be i shall today discuss the first onslaught upon the enlightenment next time i propose to continue with that and in particular to deal with the attitudes and the ideas and the effects of the ideas of rousseau in the fourth lecture i propose to deal with the rise the real full blast effect of romanticism both upon the arts and upon literature and on thought and life in the fifth lecture i propose to deal with specific results of it in the early 19th century and in particular in france and in the last lecture i propose to try and draw a summary of all that i've said and consider what parts of it are alive and what parts of it are dead for us now and what effect it has had is having and even perhaps is likely to have upon our own lives let me therefore go back to the subject of which i spoke the enlightenment of the late 17th and early 18th century needs some definition there are certain propositions if we like to boil them down to that which are as it were the three legs upon which the whole western tradition rested these are not confined to the enlightenment although the enlightenment gave a particular version transformed them in a particular manner these three principles are roughly these that all genuine questions can be answered that if a question cannot be answered it is not a question we may not know what the answer is someone else will we may be too weak or too stupid or too ignorant to be able to discover the answer for ourselves in that case the answer may perhaps be known to persons wiser than we experts in the elite of some sort we may be sinful creatures and therefore incapable of ever arriving at the truth by ourselves in that case we shall not know it in this world but perhaps will in the next or perhaps it was known as some golden age before the fall and the flood had rendered us as weak and as sinful as we are or perhaps the golden age is not in the past but in the future and we shall discover the truth then if not here there if not now at some other time but in principle the answer must be known if not to men that attenuate to an omniscient being to god if the answer is not noble at all if the answer is in some way is in principle shrouded from us then there must be something wrong with the question this is a proposition which is common both to christian and to scholastic to enlightenment and to positivist tradition of today it is in fact the backbone of what might be called the main western tradition and it is this that romanticism in a certain sense cracked the second proposition is that all these answers are knowable let's say they can be discovered by means which can be learned and taught to other persons though there are techniques by which it is possible to learn and to teach ways of discovering what the world consists of what part we occupy in it what our relation is to people what our relation is to things what true values are and every other serious and answerable question the third proposition is that all the answers must be compatible with one another because if they aren't compatible then chaos will result it is clear that the true answer to one question cannot be incompatible with a true answer to another question it is a logical truth that one true proposition cannot contradict another if all answers to all questions are to be put in the form of propositions and if all true propositions are in principle discoverable then it must follow that there is a description of an ideal universe a utopia if you like which simply is that which is described by all true answers to all serious questions and this utopia is something which although we may not be able to attain to it attenuate is that ideal in terms of which we can measure off our own present imperfections that is the general presupposition if you like of the rationalist western tradition whether christian or pagan were the theist or atheist now the particular twist which the enlightenment gave to it was to say that the answers were not to be obtained in many of the hitherto traditional ways i needn't dwell on that for it will be familiar to most people here the answer is not to be obtained by revelation for different men's revelations appear to contradict each other then it's not to be obtained by tradition because tradition can be shown to be often misleading and false it is not to be obtained by dogma it is not to be obtained by individual self-inspection of men of a privileged type because too many impostors have used up this role and so forth there is only one way of discovering these answers and that is by the correct use of reason deductively as in the mathematical sciences inductively as in the sciences of nature that is the only way in which answers in general true answers to serious questions may be obtained and there is no reason why these answers which after all have produced triumphant results in the worlds of physics and chemistry should not equally apply to the much more troubled fields of politics ethics and aesthetics the general pattern i wish to stress of this notion is that life in some sense or nature if you like and when 17th and 18th century authors say nature we can translate that into life perfectly easily the word nature was as much a commonplace in the 18th century as the word creative is now and had about as precise a meaning at any rate the notion of life and of nature is that of a jigsaw puzzle we lie among the as it were dejected fragments of this puzzle there must be some means of putting these bits together the all-wise man the omniscient being god or an omniscient earthly creature whichever way you would like to conceive it is in principle capable of fitting all the various bits together into one coherent pattern anyone who fits things into one coherent pattern will know what the world is like what things are what they have been what they will be what the laws are what govern it what man is what the relation of man is to things and therefore what man needs what he desires and also how to obtain it all questions whether of a factual nature or what we call a normative nature that is to say answers to questions what should i do and what i to do or what would it be right or appropriate for me to do all these questions are answerable by someone who is capable of fitting these bits of the jigsaw puzzle it is as it were like a hunt for some kind of concealed treasure the only difficulty is to find the path to the treasure upon this of course theorists have differed but in the 18th century there was a fairly wide consensus that what newton had achieved in the region of physics could surely also be applied to the region of ethics and politics the regions of ethics and of politics presented a rare disorder it was perfectly clear i mean then as now that people didn't know what the answers to these questions were how should one live were republics preferable to monarchies was it right to seek pleasure or to do one's duty or could they be reconciled was it right to be ascetic or was it right to be a voluptuous was it proper to obey elites of specialists who knew the truth or was it the case that every man had a right to his own particular opinion as to what to do and was majority opinion of necessity to be taken as the correct answer to political life was the good something which was intuited as an external property as something which is out there eternal objective true for all men in all circumstances everywhere or was the good only something which a particular person in a particular situation happened to like or happen to be inclined towards these questions were then as now of a puzzling nature it was quite natural that people should say here was newton who had found physics in a very similar state with a great many criss-crossing hypotheses founded upon a great deal of classical and scholastic error with a very few masterly strokes he had managed to reduce this enormous chaos to comparative order from a very few clear physical mathematical propositions he was able to deduce the position and the velocity of every particle in the universe or if not to deduce them to place weapons in people's hands with which they could if they applied themselves deduce them weapons which any intelligent man could in principle use for himself surely if this kind of order could be instituted in the world of physics the same messages produce equally splendid and lasting results in the worlds of morals politics aesthetics and the rest of the chaotic world of human opinion where people appear to struggle with each other and murder each other and destroy each other and humiliate each other in the name of incredible principles this appeared to be a very reasonable help and it appeared to be a very worthy human ideal at any rate this is certainly the idea of the enlightenment now the enlightenment was certainly not as it sometimes maintained a kind of uniform movement in which of which all the members believed approximately the same things for example opinions about human nature differed very widely fontenelle and every more voltaire and lametri thought that man was hopelessly jealous envious wicked corrupt and weak and therefore needed the most strenuous possible discipline in order to keep his head just above water so to speak he needed in other words a rigid discipline for the purpose of making him capable of coping with life at all others on the other hand thought on the contrary didn't take quite so black of you and thought that man was essentially a malleable substance clay which any competent educator any enlightened legislator could mold into perfectly proper and rational shape and there were of course a few persons like russo and others who thought that man was naturally neither neutral nor wicked but in fact good and had only been ruined by institutions of his own making and if these institutions could be altered or reformed in a very drastic way man's natural goodness would burst forth and the reign of love could be once again created upon the earth again some imminent doctrinaires of the enlightenment believed in the immortality of the soul others believed that the notion of a soul was a hollow superstition and there was no such entity some believed in for example the elites in the necessity of government by the wise that the mob would never learn that there was an inequality of gifts which was permanent among mankind and unless men could somehow be trained to obey experts as they obey experts in for example those techniques which clearly need them such as let us say navigation or economics or whatever it may be unless men could be induced to obey those who knew the elite of experts life on earth would continue to be a jungle others on the other hand believed that in matters of ethics and of politics every man was his own expert that while not everyone could be a good mathematician all men by inspecting their own hearts could know the difference between good and evil right and wrong and only didn't know it because they had been misled by knaves or fools in the past by self-interested rulers wicked soldiers corrupt priests and other enemies of man and that if these persons could be eliminated or liquidated in some way then every man could be placed in a situation where these clear answers could be discovered by every man written in eternal letters upon graven in eternal letters upon his own heart as in fact russo preached and there were other disagreements as well into which i didn't go but what i think is common to them all is the view that virtue consists ultimately in knowledge that if we know what we are and we know what we need and we know where to obtain it and we obtain it by the best means in our position then we can live happy virtuous just free and contented lives that all virtues are in fact compatible with one another that it is impossible for it to be the case that the answer to the question should one seek justice is yes and the answer to the question should one seek mercy is yes and that these two answers somehow prove incompatible equality liberty fraternity must be compatible with one another so much mercy and justice it is impossible if a bear were to say that for example the truth could make someone miserable this must somehow be demonstrated to be false if it could be shown that in some way total liberty was incompatible with total equality there must be some misunderstanding in the argument and so on this was a belief which i think all these men held and above all they held that these general propositions were obtainable by the dependable methods used by natural scientists in the establishing of the great triumph of the 18th century namely the natural sciences this i think qualifies them all now before i go on to the to the particular form of attack upon it let me explain to you that this of course penetrates as much into the realm of the arts as it does into that of the sciences and that of ethics uh for example if you ask what was the dominant aesthetic theory of the early 18th century the dominant aesthetic theory was that man should hold up the mirror to nature spoken like that it seems a rather tedious platitude in fact a falsehood to hold up a mirror to nature's marriage to copy what is already there these people i don't think meant that by this particular phrase by nature they meant life and by life they meant not what one saw but that towards which they supposed life to strive certain ideal forms towards which all life was tending no doubt it was a clever thing on the part of the painter's luxes in athens to paint birds so realistically to paint up solid grapes so realistically the birds came to peck at them it was very skillful on the part of raphael to paint gold pieces so skillfully that the innkeeper thought them to be genuine and let him go without paying his account but these were not the highest flights of human artistic genius the highest flight of human autistic genius consisted in somehow visualizing that inner objective ideal towards which nature and man tended and somehow embodying this in a noble painting that is to say there is there is some kind of universal pattern and this universal pattern the artist is able to incorporate images as the philosopher or the scientist is capable of incorporating in propositions let me read you a very typical statement by fontenelle who was the most representative of all figures of the enlightenment and led a very careful and very rational life which enabled them to live to the age of 100. he said a work of politics morals criticism possibly even of literature will be finer all things considered if made by the hands of a geometer that is because geometers are persons who understand the rational interrelationships of things and anybody who understands the pattern which nature follows because nature is surely a rational entity otherwise man would not be able to conceive it or understand it at all that is the argument if anyone who can do that is surely able to elicit from the apparent chaos and confusion of nature those eternal principles those necessary connections which bind together the eternal and objective elements out of which the the world is composed music in the 17th century said aristotle's poetics is only a nature reduced method good sense reduced to principle and pope repeated that in famous lines saying those rules of old discovered not devised are nature still but nature methodized that is roughly speaking the official doctrine of the 18th century namely that you discover the method in nature herself reynolds who i suppose was the most representative aesthetic theorist certainly in england of his period in the 18th century said the painter corrects nature by herself her imperfect state by her more perfect he makes out an abstract idea of forms more perfect than any one in the original this is the famous ideal beauty by which he says by this phidias acquired his immortal fame therefore we must understand what it is that nature what the ideal consists of the idea is there are certain persons for example who are more eminent than others alexander the great is a more splendid figure than a lame or blind mega and therefore deserves more of the artist than the name of blind beggar who is a mere accident of nature nature tends towards perfection we know what perfection is by some inner sense which tells us what is norm and what is abnormal what is the ideal and what is the deviation from this idea therefore says reynolds with great firmness if alexander had happened to be of low stature do not render himself bernini should never have let david bite his lower lip because that is a mean expression inappropriate to royal rank if says if saint paul was of mean appearance as we're told rafael was right not so to draw him and pero writing it towards the end of the 18th century says it it is a great pity that houma allows his heroes to be too familiar with swineherds he doesn't i suppose that doesn't wish to deny that perhaps hermes heroes or persons whom he drew his originals might have been a civilian with fine heads as in fact they are represented as being but if so there shouldn't have been and the business of the painter is not simply realistically to reproduce what is there that is what the dutch too often do and this merely populates the world with a number of copies of entities which originally had no need to be there the the the purpose of painting is to convey to the questing intellect or the questing soul what it is that nature seeks after nature seeks after beauty and perfection all these people believe that it may not have attained to it particularly man conspicuously had not attained to it but by inspecting nature we observe the general lines upon which he proceeds we see what it is that she's trying to produce we know the difference between a stunted oak and a fully grown oak we know when we call it stunted that it is an oak which has failed to become that which it was as it were intended by itself or by nature to be in the same way there are objective ideals of beauty of grandeur of magnificence of wisdom which is the business of writers philosophers preachers painters sculptors composers to in some way to convey to us that is the general notion winkleman who i suppose is the most the most original of all the aesthetic theories of the century and who introduced this passionate nostalgic taste for classical art winkelmann speaks about noble tranquility and calm restraint why noble tranquility why calm restraint he doesn't any more than anyone else suppose that all the ancients were nobly tranquil or calmly restrained but he does think that this is the idea of what man should be he does think that to be a roman senator to be a greek auditor whatever it is that he regarded as the perfection of man what all the germans in his time tended to think of as most perfect men were persons who tended towards this noblest of human ideals and the sculptors who in this way immortalized these particular traits hold up before us the ideal of what man can be and in this way not only inspire us to imitate these ideals but reveal to us the inner purposes of nature reveal to us reality reality life nature ideal these things are identical for these particular thinkers just as mathematics deals in perfect circles so the sculptor and the painter must deal in ideal forms this i think is the rational the rationalist notion of most 18th century aesthetics that is why there is a comparative neglect of history although it's true that voltaire was the first person who began to write history no longer of individual kings and conquerors and captains and adventurers but took an interest in people's morals like clothes their habits their judicial institutions although some interest in what might be called the general history of people's manners as well as individual conquests the treaties had got going in the 18th century nevertheless there is no doubt that when bullying brock said that history was nothing but philosophy teaching by examples he was voicing a very common view voltaire's interest in history was to show how men were much the same in most ages and how the same causes produced the same effects and the purpose of that was to show sociologically what we were like what kind of ends men sought after what kind of means did not bring them about what kind of means did bring them about and in this way to create some kind of science of how to live well the same is true of hume who also spoke in much the same way he said most men in most circumstances obeying the same causes behave in roughly the same fashion the purpose of history is not simply curiosity about what happened in the past desire to revive something which occurred in the past simply because we feel passionately interested in what our ancestors were like or because we wish in some way to connect the past with ourselves to see what it was that we grew out of that i think was not the principle spring of these men's interests the principal spring was simply an accumulation of data upon which general propositions could be constructed telling one what to do how to live what to be that is a most historical possible attitude which can be taken towards history and it is the fairly characteristic attitude of the 18th century including great historians who despite themselves throughout great history like gibbel whose ideals were a great great deal inferior to his actual performance now these being the general notions of the enlightenment you can see that in the case of the arts it would lead to speak to the formal the noble the symmetrical the proportional the judicious there were of course exceptions to this i don't say everybody believed exactly the same thing this is very uncommon in any age even in france even in classical france there were all kinds of quietest and convulsionist persons of hysterical ecstatic temperament there were people like governor who said who complained bitterly about the appalling emptiness of life there was madame de la papillinier who said she wished to throw herself out of the window because she felt that life had no meaning in her purpose but these were comparatively speaking a minority broadly speaking it could be said that it was voltaire and his friends people like elvishes people just to a certain extent like like fontenelle who represented what might be called the major position of the age and this was that we were progressing we were discovering we were destroying ancient prejudice superstition ignorance and cruelty and we were well on the way towards establishing some kind of science which would make people happy free virtuous and just it was rarely this that was attacked by the person about to discuss next now certain cracks in what might be called this rather smooth wall rather smug and smooth wall in some ways had already proceeded from the enlightenment itself for example montesquieu who was a very typical representative of the enlightenment had suggested that men were not the same everywhere and this proposition which had already been noted by a good many greeks office but had been forgotten i think intermediately in a certain sense did make a sort of dent in the general picture though not a very deep one his point was that if you are a person and brought up in the personal conditions you might not want what you would want if you were a parisian and brought up in paris that men were not made happy by the same things that they attempt to fost upon the chinese things which delighted the french or upon the french things which the light of the chinese would cause misery in both places and the darfur one had to be very careful in altering laws in reforming in generally speaking looking after people if one was a statesman or a politician or even in personal relations in friendship and family life to consider very carefully what are the actual needs what is the process of growth what is the particular what are the conditions in which a specific body of persons grew up he attached enormous importance to soil climate and political institutions others attached importance to other factors but whichever way you look at it the general notion was that of general relativism that what did for people in birmingham would not do for people in bakara roughly speaking now in the sense of course this did contradict the proposition that there were certain objective uniform eternal fixed entities for example certain forms of pleasure which pleased everyone everywhere that there were certain true propositions which all men at all times could have discovered themselves but only failed to do because they were too stupid or placed in unfortunate circumstances so there is a form of life which once it is introduced into the universe could be made there could be as it were fixed as eternal would not need to be altered because it was perfect because it satisfied the permanent interest and desires of men it did contradict that but it didn't contradict it very sharply all it said was that all men in fact sought the same thing namely happiness contentment harmony justice liberty none of us he denied but different circumstances made different means of attaining it necessary this was a very sensible remark and didn't in principle contradict the foundations of the enlightenment he did make an observation which did shock people he said when montezuma said to cortes that the christian religion was all very well for spain but the aztec religion might be best for his people what he said was not absurd this of course did shock both parties it shocked the roman church and it shocked the left wing it shocked the roman church for obvious reasons it shocked the left wing because they too knew that since the catholic what the catholic church said was false the opposite was true since what's the aztec religion said was false the opposite was true and therefore the notion that propositions which might not themselves appear true to us yet might do for some other culture that in fact one ought to estimate the value of religious truths not in accordance with some objective standard of truth but some much more flexible pragmatic means namely whether it made the people who believed in them happy have suited their way of life developed certain ideals among them fitted into the general texture of their life from that experience that did appear to both sides both the roman church and the atheistic materialists as being in some sense a betrayal nevertheless this is roughly speaking the kind of criticism which montesquieu brought and as i say it modified the picture somewhat it did modify the proposition that the word eternal truth eternal institutions eternal values suitable for everyone everywhere you had to be more flexible you had to say well not eternal perhaps not everywhere most people in those places with due adjustment made for time and place but if we did that you could still preserve the foundations of the views of the indictment somewhat deeper breach was made by hume in this very intelligent interesting amusing and remarkable book the heavenly city of the 18th century philosophers the late professor becker thinks that hume really blew up the entire entitlement position by showing that the necessities in which these philosophers believed that the network of rigorous logical relationships out of which the universe consisted and which reason could grasp and live by that this was not true and therefore he somehow undermined the general notion of a kind of seamless garment or harmony of necessary connections i don't agree with him about this but i don't wish to go into this in detail here hume's chief service in the attack on the enlightenment consisted and it was he certainly didn't appear to himself to be doing this consisted in doubting whether two propositions one whether the causal relationship was something which we directly perceived or indeed knew to exist at all he said that so far from things being necessitated by other things they just followed along in a regular manner without being necessitated instead of saying causes must produce effects or this event must produce that event or this situation cannot help arising in that situation all you needed to say was usually the situation follows this situation normally this thing is to be found before or at the same time as or after that thing so that for factual purposes it didn't make great real difference the second proposition more important for our purposes is that when he asked himself how he knew that there was an external world at all he said he couldn't deduce it logically there was no way of demonstrating the tables existed there was no way of demonstrating that at this moment at hume i am eating an egg or i am drinking a glass of water demonstrating no i can demonstrate things in dramaturgy i can demonstrate things in arithmetic i can demonstrate things in logic i might i suppose be able to demonstrate things in heraldry or chess or other sciences which follow from artificial rules conventionally established but i can't prove with mathematical certainty that anything exists all i can say is that if i ignore it i shall rule it if i if i suppose there is no table in front of me and walk into it i shall probably suffer discomfort but demonstrate it in the in the sense in which i can demonstrate mathematical propositions demonstrated in the sense in which i can demonstrate a proposition in logic where the opposite is not merely false but meaningless that i cannot do and therefore i must accept the world on belief on trust belief is not the same as deductive certainty indeed deduction doesn't apply to matter the fact at all well without going into the head in the vast history of logic and philosophy it clearly did weaken the general position according to which the universe was a rational whole each part of which was as it was necessarily because it was necessitated by the other parts of it and the whole thing was made beautiful and rational by the fact that none of the things in it could be otherwise as they were the old belief was that whatever was true was necessarily true that things could not be otherwise as they were and that is why spinoza and people who thought like him when i understand that things are inevitable i accept them much more willingly no man wants to believe that two plus two equals five anyone who says two plus two has always equaled four but this is a very suffocating truth cannot could it not be the case occasionally the two plus two would be four and a half or seventeen anyone who wanted to break out of this hideous prison of the multiplication table would be regarded in the whole as not quite same on the whole we assume that the proposition of two plus two equals four or that um if a is larger than b and b is larger than c then it is probable that a is larger than c these kind of propositions are propositions which we accept as being part of the general rational process of thought part of what we mean by sanity by rationality if all facts in the universe would be reduced to this then we would no longer kick against them that is the great rationalist presupposition if all the things which at present you hate and you fear could be so represented as to flow by necessarily logical chains from everything else that there was you would accept it as being not only inevitable but reasonable and therefore delightful as much as two plus two equals four or any other logical truth upon which you found your life upon which your thought rests that is the idea of rationalism this fume certainly broke now let me now say that in spite of the fact that motor skilled hume did make these faint dents in the particular theory of which i speak one by showing that not everything was everywhere the same the other by saying there were no necessities only probabilities the difference that made was not very large hume certainly thought that the universe would proceed much as it did he certainly thought there were rational irrational courses of action he certainly thought that men could have made happy by rational means he believed in science he believed in reason he believed in cool judgment he believed in all the well-known propositions of the 18th century he believed in art executives reynolds believed in it executives dr johnson believed in it the logical implications of his ideas didn't really become evident until the late 19th and 20th century the attack of which i wish to speak came from a very different quarter the attacker which i wish to speak came from the germans now the truth about the germans in the 17th and 18th century is that they are somewhat backward province they don't wish to think themselves in this light but it remains true that they were in the 16th century the germans were as progressive and as dynamic and as generous contributors to european culture as anyone else certainly durable was a greater painter as any european player of his time certainly luther was the greatest religious fighter as anyone who had occurred in european history but if you look at germany in the 70th century for whatever reason and particularly the early 18th century with the exception of the one great figure of leibniz who certainly is a philosopher of a world scale it is very difficult to see who among german thinkers or who among those germans were affected so it speaks of thought or the even even to certain degree the art of the world in any significant fashion particularly towards the end of the 17th century could be named what the reason for this is is rather difficult to say i'm not a competent historian and i therefore don't altogether i don't wish to volunteer too much but it does seem as if for some reason or other the germans failed to achieve centralized statehood as england and france and even holland achieved it they were governed in the 18th century and indeed the 17th by 300 princes and twelve hundred sub princes the emperor had interest in italy and elsewhere which prevented him from paying due attention perhaps to his german lands and above all there was the violent dislocation of the thirty years war in the course of which the troops of louis xiv and of others destroyed and killed a very large section of the german population and crushed what might have been a cultural development simply in seas of blood this was a misfortune of an unexampled kind in european history and such a number of persons had never been killed for any reason before since the days of genghis khan and the misfortune to germany was crushing and it crushed her spirit to a very high degree with the result for one reason or another their german culture became provincialized became disrupted into these tiny stuffy provincial courts there was no paris there was no center there was no life there was no pride there was no sense of growth dynamism and power german culture drifted into either extreme scholastic pedentry of a lutheran kind scholarship or minute but rather dry kind or else into a revolt against this scholarship in the direction of the inner life of the human soul this was no doubt stimulated by lutheranism as such but particularly by the fact that there was a kind of huge national inferiority complex which i think began at that period vis-a-vis the great progressive western states vis-a-vis particularly the french this brilliant glittering state which has managed to crush and humiliate them this great country which dominated the sciences and the arts and all the provinces of human life were the kind of arrogance and success unexampled hitherto and this did plant in germany a permanent sense of sadness and humiliation which may be discovered in the rather fair german literature ballot literature and popular literature of the end of the 17th century and even in the arts in which the germans excelled even in music which tends to be domestic religious passionate inward and above all different from the glittering caught art and the splendid secular achievements of composers like rambo and cupra there's no doubt that if you compare someone like bach and his contemporaries and telemen with french music with that period even though bach's genius is incomparably greater the whole atmosphere the whole tone so to speak of his music is much more confined to the particular uh when's the provincialism but to generate the sort of inner religious life of the city of leipzig or wherever he might have happened to live and was not intended to be an offering before the glittering courts of europe or the general admiration of mankind in the way in which the paintings and the musical compositions of the english the dutch the french and the other leading nations of the world obviously were so intended at any rate that is what occurred and the pietist movement of which i was which i wish to say a few words because it really is the root of romanticism the pietest movement became deeply embedded in germany pietism was a branch of lutheranism and it consisted in careful study of the bible profound respect for the personal relationship of man to god therefore emphasis upon spiritual life contempt for learning contempt for ritual and for form contempt for pump and ceremony and a tremendous emphasis upon the individual relationship of the individual suffering human soul with jamaica spaina franket since arnold all these founders of the pirates movement were men who in some way managed to bring comfort and salvation to a large collection of socially crushed and politically miserable human beings so that in a certain sense what occurred was a kind of retreat in depth let me tell you that it all it sometimes happens in human history even though parallels may be dangerous that when the natural road towards human fulfillment is in some way blocked human beings retreat into themselves become wrought up in themselves and try and create inwardly that world which some evil fate has denied them externally this is certainly what happened in ancient greece when alexander the great began to destroy the city states and the stakes and epicureans began to preach immorality of personal salvation which took the form of saying that politics was unimportant civil life was unimportant all these great ideas held up by pericles by demosthenes by plato and by aristotle were trivial and as nothing before the imperative need of personal individual salvation this was really a very grand form of sour grapes if you cannot obtain if you cannot obtain that which which you really desire from the world you must teach yourself not to want it if you cannot get what you want you must teach yourself to want what you can get this is a very frequent form of so to speak the spiritual retreat in depth into a kind of inner citadel in which you try and lock yourself up against all the fearful ills of the world the king of my province the prince confiscates my land i don't want to own land the prince doesn't wish to give me a rank rank is trivial unimportant the king has robbed me of my possessions possessions are nothing my children have died of malnutrition and disease earthly possessions even children love of children is as nothing but the love of god and so forth so you gradually hedge yourself round by a kind of tight wall in which you seek to reduce the vulnerable surface you want to be as little wounded as possible every kind of wound is being heaped upon you and therefore you wish to contract yourself into the smallest possible area so that as little of you as possible is exposed to wounds this is in a sense the mood in which the german poet is operated and the result of that was an intense inner life a great deal of very moving and very interesting but highly personal violently emotional literature hatred of the intellect and above all of course violent hatred of france of wigs of silk stockings of salons of corruption of generals of emperors of all the great and and magnificent figures of this world who are simply incarnations of wealth wickedness of the devil this is the natural reactions it's become the part of a pious and humiliated population and this happens since since that day in other places as well it's a particular form so to speak of anti-culture anti-intellectualism and xenophobia to which the germans were at that particular moment particularly prone this is the provincialism which some of the german thinkers cherished and adored the 18th century and against which goethe and shilla fought all their lives now let me give you a typical quotation i think from tinsendorf who i suppose was the leader of the uh heron bhuta which was a sort of section of the moravian brotherhood who which was a large section of the piety's population of the pietist group he said whoso wishes to grasp god with his intellect becomes an atheist and this was simply an echo of luther who said reason is a and must be avoided now let me give you a social effect about these germans which i think is not all together irrelevant if you ask who were the germans of the 18th century who were the thinkers who most influenced germany and who whom we have heard there is a rather peculiar sociological fact about them which in a sense supports the thesis which i wish to put before you which is that the whole thing is a product of wounded national sensibility and of dreadful national humiliation the whole of the the roots of the romantic movement really on the part of the germans if you ask who the thinkers were you will find that in contrast to the french they came from an entirely different social media blessing herder were all very humbly born hegel shelling schiller hildelin were middle class goethe was a rich bourgeois but only attained a proper title later only christian novalis were what would in those days be called country gentlemen the only persons with any degree of aristocratic connection which could be said to take part in german literature german life german painting any kind of german civilization whom i could discover were the two brothers counts counts stallberg and the mystic baron eckerd's house and not exactly first class figures not exactly figures in the front rank if on the other hand you think about the french of this period of all the radicals the left wing the most extreme um opponents of orthodoxy of the church of the monarchy of the status quo all these persons came from a very very different world montesquieu was a baron kondiak was account condorcet was a marquis mobley was both an abe and account before became account volney was well born and so was the bear dollar bear was the illegitimate son of a nobleman helvinishas was not noble but his father had been doctor to madame and he was a millionaire and a tax farmer and moved in court circles baron grimm and baron holbach with two german barons who came to live in paris from the reindeer one from the reindeer one from the bohemia there were a certain number of obeys was the secretary of the neopolitan embassy the abe marie and the aberrant were of good origin even voltaire was came from the minor gentry only deidre only did rousseau were commoners real commoners really did come from the poor and rusev was a swiss another doesn't count in this particular category and consequently the point i wish to make is that these persons spoken with a different language they were no doubt oppositional but they were oppositional against persons who came from the same class as themselves they went to salons they glittered they were persons of high polish great education and splendid prose style and generous and handsome outlook on life and their mere existence irritated humiliated and infuriated the germans when herder came to paris in the early 70s he was unable to get into contact with any of these men it appeared to him that they were all artificial highly mannered extremely self-conscious dry soulless little dancing masters and salons who had no soul who didn't understand the inner life of man who didn't understand what the purpose of human beings were who in some way were debarred by either bad doctrine or by false origin from understanding the true purposes of men on earth and the true potentialities the true rich and generous potentialities which human beings have been endowed with god this in a certain sense also created the chasm between the germans and the french so the mere thought of these fronder near thought of this opposition even on the part of those who themselves hated the church of rome and themselves hated the king of france the mere thought of these people filled them with nausea disgust humiliation and inferiority and this dug an enormous ditch between the germans and the french which not all the cultural interchanges which can be traced by scholars in fact were able to overcome this i think is perhaps one of the roots of the german opposition to the french from which romanticism began now let me tell you a few words in the time left to me about the man who in my view is was really the man who struck the most violent blow at the enlightenment and began the whole romantic process the whole process of revolt against a particular world which i've to some extent try to draw he's an obscure figure but obscure figures sometimes create great consequences hitler two after all was obscure man during a certain portion of his life johann georg harman was the son of very obscure parents his father was a boss keeper in the city of konigsberg and he was brought up in east russia in a pietist environment he was a nerd wheel he wasn't able to get a job he was wrote a little poetry a little criticism he did it quite well but not well enough to secure a living he was supported by his neighbor and friend emmanuel kant who lived in the same city and with whom he quarreled for the rest of his life and then he was sent by some rich baltic merchants to london for the purpose of transacting a piece of business which he failed to complete but instead drank gambled and got into heavy debt as a result of these excesses he was near suicide and then had the religious experience read the old testament which his pietist parents and grandparents had sworn by and suddenly was spiritually transformed realized that the story of the jews was the story of every man that when he read the book of ruth or when he read the book of job when he read about the tribulations of abraham god was directly speaking to his soul and telling him that there were certain spiritual events which had infinite significance far different from anything which they might appear on the set which might appear on the surface in this transformed religious condition he came back to koenigsberg and began to write he wrote obscurely under many pseudonyms he wrote in a style which is proved from this day to that unreadable at the same time he had a very powerful and marked influence upon a number of other writers who in their turn had a considerable influence upon european life he was admired by herder who certainly transformed the writing of history and transformed to some degree also the whole attitude towards the arts which prevails today he had an influence on goethe who wished to edit his works and who regarded him as one of the most gifted and profound spirits of his time and supported him against all possible rivals he had an influence on captain guard who lived after he died who said he was certainly the profoundest writer he had ever read not intelligible even to him nevertheless although europe's currently it is possible by dint of extreme attention which i don't really commend this particular audience to collect certain grains of sense from the extraordinary contorted metaphors euphemistic stylisms allegories and other forms of dark poetical speech with which harman's fragmentary writings never finished anything are written and the doctrine which he enunciated was approximate to this he began with hume and he said in effect that hume was right that if you ask yourself how it is that you know the universe you know the universe not by intellect but by faith if hume said that he could not even break an egg he could not even drink a glass of water without an act of faith which could not be bolstered up by logic how much more this was true of almost every other experience we had and of course harman wished to say that his belief in god and the creation were bolstered by precisely the same argument as hume's belief in his egg and his glass of water the french built in general propositions general propositions of the sciences but the general propositions of the sciences never caught the actual living palpitating reality of life if you met a man and wished to know what he was like the idea of clapping upon him various psychological and sociological generalizations gleaned from the works of montesquieu or of cordiac would teach you nothing the only way in which you discovered what human beings were like was by speaking to them by communicating with them communication meant an actual meeting of two human beings and by watching the man's face and by watching the contortions of his body and his gestures by hearing his words and in many other ways which you could not outwards analyze you became convinced datum was presented to you knew to whom it was you were talking communication was established the attempt to analyze this communication into scientific general propositions would of necessity fail general propositions were baskets of an extremely crude kind they were concepts and categories which differentiated that which was common to a great many things common to many men of different thoughts common to many things of different sorts common to various ages what they left out of necessity because they were general was that which was unique that which was particular that which was the specific property of this particular man or this particular thing and that alone was of interest too according to hama if you wished to read a book you were not interested in what this book had in common with many other books if you looked at the picture you didn't wish to know what principles had gone to the making of this picture which had also gone to the making of a thousand other pictures in a thousand other ages by a thousand different painters you wish to react directly to the specific message if you like to the specific reality which looking at this picture reading this particular book speaking to this man praying to this god would in fact convey to you therefore he drew from this a kind of bergsonian conclusion namely that there was a flow of life that they attempt to cut this flow into segments in some sense killed it the sciences very well for their own purposes if you wish to discover about how to grow plants and even them not always correctly if you wish to know about some kind of general principles about the general properties of bodies in general whether physical or chemical if you wish to know about what climates would assist what kind of growths to develop in them and so forth no doubt the signs are very well but this is not what men ultimately thought if you ask yourself what were men after what did men really want what men wanted was not at all what voltaire supposed they wanted voltaire thought they wanted happiness voltaire thought they wanted contentment voltaire thought that they wanted peace but this was not true what men wanted was for all our faculties to play in the richest and most violent possible fashion what men wanted was to create what men wanted was to make and if this making led to clashes if it led to wars if it led to struggles then this was part of the human lot a man who had been put in a vulcarian garden paired and pruned as it were who had been brought up by some wise philosoph in knowledge of physics and the knowledge of chemistry and the knowledge of mathematics and all knowledge of all the sciences which the encyclopedias had recommended such a man would in fact be a form of death in life the sciences if they were applied to human society would lead to a kind of fearful bureaucracization he thought for him scientists bureaucrats persons who made things tidy every form smooth lutheran clergyman deists everybody wants to put things in boxes everybody who wish to assimilate one thing to another who wish to prove for example that creation was really the same as obtaining of certain data which nature provides and the rearrangement in certain pleasing patterns and whereas of course for harman creation was the most ineffable indescribable unanalyzable personal act by which a human being in some way ladies stamp upon nature allowed his will to saw spoke his word utter death which was within him and which would not broke any kind of obstacle and therefore to him the whole of the enlightenment doctrine appeared to kill veterans living in human beings appeared to substitute for the creative energies of man and for the whole rich world of the senses without which it is impossible for human beings to live to eat to drink to be married to meet other people to indulge in a thousand and one acts without which people wither and die that the enlightenment on the whole laid no stress on that that the human being is painted by enlightenment thinkers was an artificial kind of not economic man but nearly some kind of toy some kind of lifeless model which had no relation to the kind of human beings met and wished to associate with every day in his life goethe says much the same thing about mendelssohn he says mendelssohn treats beauty as entomologists feed butterflies he catches the poor animal and he pins it down and as its exquisite colors drop off there it lies a lifeless dead corpse under the pin this is aesthetics this is a very typical reaction so it's become a part of the youthful romantic ghetto of the 1770s under the influence of haman against the tendency on the part of the french to generalize to classify to pin down to arrange albums to try and produce some kind of rational ordering of human experience leaving out as is supposed to be the lavital the flow the individuality they create desires to create the desire even to struggle the that in human beings which produced between people of different views perhaps what might be called a creative clash of opinion instead of that dead harmony and peace which according to haman and his followers the french were after that i think is how haman began let me give you some typical quotations and you will see the kind of thing the bliss of the human cells as harman is not at all what voltaire seems to think namely happiness the bliss of the human soul is rooted in the untrembled realization of its powers as man is made in god's image so is the body the picture of the soul this is quite an interesting view the body is a picture of the soul because when you meet a human being and you say what is he like you judge by his face you judge by his body and the idea there is a soul and a body which can be uh dissected that there is spirit and flesh which are different that the body is one thing but there is something inside the man a kind of ghost palpitating inside this machine which is quite different from in fact what the man is in his totality in his unity is a typical dissecting french view what is this reason with its universality infallibility over willingness certainty self-evidence and it is a stuffed dummy which the howling superstition of unreason has endowed with divine attributes the abe dupont at the beginning of the 18th century said what one has felt and thought in in one language one expressed with equal elegance in any other this new harman was absolute madness language is that with which we express ourselves there is no such thing as thought on the one handed language on the other language is not a glove which we put in our thought when we think we think in symbols we think in words and therefore all translation isn't principle impossible those who think think in particular symbols and these symbols are the ones which strike upon the senses and imagination of the people whom we speak approximations maybe in other languages but if you really wish to enter into contact with a human being if you really wish to understand what they think what they feel what they are then you must understand every dress travel you must understand every nurse you must watch their eyes you must observe the movement of their lips you must hear their words you must understand their handwriting and then you come to direct acquaintance with actual sources of life anything less than that they attempt to translate his language into another language to classify all his various movements by some anatomical or physiognomical means to try and put him into a box with a lot of other people and produce a learned volume which will as it were simply classify him as one of a species one of a type that is the way to miss all knowledge that is the way to kill that is the way to apply concepts and categories hollow baskets to the palpitating unique asymmetrical um unclassifiable flesh of living human experience this is roughly speaking the doctrine of harmon and that is the doctrine which he bequeathed to his followers to abolish caprice and fancy in the arts he said is to be like an assassin plotting against the arts life and honor passion that is what art possesses passion which cannot be described and cannot be classified that is what moses mendelson that aesthetic moses moses aesthetic law giver he says wants to circumcise he wants to circumcise all these aesthetic commandments thou shalt not assail this thou shalt not taste that in a free state he says where the leaves from the divine book of the divine shakespeare blow about in all the tempests of time in a free state how dare a man do this goethe said about him in order to achieve the impossible he stretches his hand to all the elements all that a man undertakes must bring to his united powers all separation is to be rejected i must i think stop at this point and my next lecture i propose to god with the influence of harmon upon the german romantics and the very valent impact which the developer made upon the body of the french enlightened [Applause] establishment
