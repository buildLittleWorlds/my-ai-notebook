TRANSCRIPT:

um ladies and gentlemen I want to begin by thanking the trustees of the National Gallery and in particular Mr Walker for saying kind things about me and for giving me much more than I do it's infinitely more agreeable to receive more money during the months do that I can show you of and indeed in being asked to deliver these lectures I receive more than I do for so far as I can gather these lectures are primarily intended for genuine experts on the arts art historians and experts on Aesthetics amongst whom I cannot possibly count myself it is therefore a particular generosity on that part to have invited me my only valid excuse for talking about the subject is that the Romantic Movement naturally is relevant to the Arts the Arts even though I know not very much about them cannot be altogether kept out and I promise not to keep them out beyond measure the second reason why I can't claim some qualification for talking about the subject is that I propose to deal with political and social and moral life as well and it is true I think to say of the Romantic Movement that it is not only a movement in which the Arts are concerned not in an artistic movement but perhaps the first moment certainly in the history of the West when the Arts dominated other aspects of life when there was a kind of tyranny of out every life which in some sense is the essence of the Romantic Movement at least I propose to try and demonstrate that this is so yeah certainly the interest in Romanticism is not simply a historical historical one a great little movement to the present day nationalism existentialism admiration for Great Men admiration for impersonal institutions democracy totalitarianism all these things are profoundly affect it by the rights of Romanticism which enters them all and that is why it is subject not altogether irrelevant even to our own day perhaps you would expect me to begin or it is to attempt to begin with some kind of definition of Romanticism or at least some generalization in order to say what it is that I mean by it I don't propose to walk into that particular trap the imminent and why is Professor Northrop fry points out that whenever anyone embarks on a generalization on the subject of Romanticism even something so innocuous for example is to say that a new attitude sprang up among English poets towards nature let us say Wordsworth and Coleridge as against say Dryden and Pope somebody will always be found who will produce countervailing evidence from the writings of foreign pre Muslim Arabian epics medieval Spanish verse and finally dried and Pope themselves and for this reason I don't propose to generalize I propose if I may simply to convey in some other way what it is that I think Romanticism to be indeed the literature under medicism is larger than dramaticism itself and the literature defining what it is of the literature and Romanticism is concerned with is quite large in a turn it's a kind of inverted pyramid it's the dangerous and Confused subject in which many have lost I won't say they are senses but at any rate that sense of direction it's like one is that like that dark cave described I think by Virgil where all the footsteps leave in One Direction the cave of polyphemus those who enter it are never seen to emerge again it is therefore with some trepidation that I embark up on the subject let me Begin by saying that I think that the importance of Romanticism is that it is the largest recent movement which transformed the lives and the thought of the Western World it seems to me to be the greatest single shift in the consciousness of the West that has occurred and all the other shifts which have occurred in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries appeared to me comparably less important and attenuate deeply influenced by it the history of not any thought but Consciousness opinion action to morals politics Aesthetics is to a large degree a history of dominant models let me try and explain what I mean always whenever you look at any particular civilization I think you will find that its most characteristic writings are dominated by a particular pattern of Life which those who engage in these writings or paint these paintings or produce this particular Music Works of pieces of music in some sense are dominated by and in order to identify civilization in order to explain what kind of civilization it is in order to understand the world in which men of this thought thought and felt and acted it is I think of importance to try so far as possible to isolate the dominant pattern which that culture obeys let me try to explain this by examples for instance if you read Greek philosophy or Greek literature of the classical age you will find for example in the case of say the philosophy of Plato that he is dominated by a geometrical or mathematical model thought to operate rates on lines which are in some way conditioned by the thought there are certain axiomatic truths adamantine unbreakable from which it is possible by severe logic to deduce certain absolutely infallible conclusions that it is possible to attain to this kind of absolute wisdom by a special method which he recommends the the research thing as absolute knowledge to be obtained in the world and if only we can attain to this absolute knowledge of which geometry and Mathematics in general is the nearest example the most perfect Paradigm if only we can do that we can organize our lives in terms of this knowledge in terms of these truths once and for all in a static manner needing no further change and then all suffering all doubt all ignorance all forms of human Vice and Folly can be expected to disappear from the Earth and this notion that there is somewhere a perfect vision and that it needs only a certain kind of severe discipline or a certain kind of method to attain to this truth which is analogous at any rate to the cold and isolated truths of mathematics this Vision then affects a great many other thinkers in the post-platonic age certainly the Renaissance which have similar ideas certainly thinkers like Spinoza thinkers in the 18th century thinkers in the 19th century too who believed it possible to attain to some kind of if not absolute attenuating nearly absolute knowledge and in terms of this to tidy the world up create some kind of rational order in which tragedy Vice and stupidity which of course the destruction in the past can at last be avoided by the use of carefully acquired information and the application to it of universally intelligible reasons something that kind now this is one way of one kind of model they might simply offer it as an example these models invariably Begin by liberating people from era from confusion from some kind of unintelligible World which they seek to explain to themselves by means of a model but they almost invariably End by enslaving those very same Men by failing to explain the health of experience by beginning his liberators and ending as in some sort of despotism take for example a parallel culture therefore the Bible that the Jews at a comfortable period you will find a totally different model dominating a totally different set of ideas which would have been unintelligible to the Greeks the notion certainly from which both Judaism and Christianity to large degrees praying is the notion of family life the relations of Father and Son perhaps the relations of members of a tribe to one another such fundamental relationships in terms of which nature and life are explained as the love of children for their father the Brotherhood of Man forgiveness atonement commands issued by superiority inferior the sense of Duty transgression sin and therefore the need to attend for it this whole complex of qualities in terms of which the whole universe is explained by those who created the Bible and by those who are to a large extent influenced by it is something which would relate to the unintelligible to Greeks let me read you a perfectly familiar Psalm and you will see um what it is they need for instance when the Sami says that the presence of the Lord the sea saw and fled Jordan was driven back the mountains skipped like Rams the hills skipped like young Lambs the Earth Trump is ordered to tremble in the presence of the Lord this would have been tempted unintelligible to play George Aristotle because the whole notion obviously speak the whole National World which is in some sense reacts personally to the orders of the Lord that all relationships with animal inanimate must in some way be interpreted in terms of the relations of human beings or regenerate generations of personalities in one case Divine in the other case human is very remote from the Greek conception of what the God was and what his relations were to mankind hence the absence among the Greeks of the notion of obligation hence the absence among the Greeks of the notion of Duty which it is so difficult for people who read the Greeks through the spectacles partly affected by The Jewels to grasp luckily try and convict you how strange different models can be because this is important in simply of tracing the history of these Transmissions of Consciousness in what I wish to convey is that considerable revolutions have occurred in the general and Outlook of mankind which is sometimes difficult to retrace because we swallow them as if they were familiar vehicle was perhaps the Italian thinker who flooded at the beginning of the 18th century if a man who was totally poor and neglected may be said to flourished weaker is the man who I suppose drew our attention to the strangeness of these ancient cultures he points out for example that in the familiar line Omnia jovis everything is full of jove which is a perfect familiar a Latin half lion something to us not only unintelligible he said on the one hand Jupiter or Dove is a large bearded Divinity who helps Thunder lightning on the other hand in some sense the entire um everything Omnia is said to be full of this bearded being which is not on the face of it intelligible and he then argues with great imagination and with great coaches here that somehow the view of these ancient peoples remote from us must have been very different flowers for them to have been able to conceive of their Divinity both as a bearded giant commanding the Gods and Men and on the other hand as something of which the whole Heavens could be full let me give you a more familiar example when Aristotle for example in the nicomercial ethics discusses the subject of friendship there are various kinds of friends for example there is friendship which consists in Passionate Infatuation by one human being with another and there is also a friendship which consists in business relationship in trading in buying and selling the fact that foreigns there are people with whole life that give a given originated with emotions are passionately engaged in love and on the other hand of course there are people who sell shoes to one another and these are species of the same genus is something which is a result perhaps of Christianity or of the Romantic Movement or whatever it may be we find it rather difficult to acclimatize ourselves too I merely give you these examples in order to convey to that these ancient cultures are Stranger than we think and that larger Transformations have occurred in the history of human consciousness then the ordinary uncritical reading of the classics would seem to convey there are great many other examples which I shall not trouble you there is of course I mean the world can be conceived organically like a tree in which every part lives for every other part and through every other part and again mechanistically as a result of say some scientific model in which the parts are external to one another and in which for example say the state or any other Human Institution is regarded as a gadget for the purpose of promoting happiness or preventing people from doing each other in these are very different conceptions of life and they too belong to different climates of opinion and are influenced by different considerations whatever rule happens is that some subject gains the ascendancy say physics or say chemistry and as a result of the enormous whole which it has upon the imagination of its generation it is applied in other spheres as well this happened to Sociology in the 19th century it happened psychology in Iraq now my thesis is that the Romantic Movement in some sense was just such a gigantic and radical transformation after which nothing was ever the same and this is the subject which I really wish to address myself where did the Romantic Movement take his rise before I even say what it is certainly not in England although technically no doubt it did that is all the historians at any rate that is not where it occurred in its most dramatic form the question arises when I speak of Romanticism do I mean something which happens historically as I appear to be saying or is it perhaps a permanent frame of mind which isn't exclusive isn't monopolized by any particular age two of my imminent predecessors the Herbert readings the Kenneth Clark both men and lecturers have taken up the position that Romanticism is a permanent state of mind which might be found anywhere so Kenneth Clark finds it I think in some lines of hadrians so herbertry is a very great many examples the Battle of the Year who has written extensively on this subject quotes Plato and platinos and the Greek novelist heliodorus and the great many other persons who who in his opinion were romantic righteous I don't wish to enter up on this issue it may be so but the subject which I wish to deal is confined in time I don't wish to deal with a permanent human attitude but with a particular transformation which historically occurred and affects us and therefore I propose to confine my attention to what occurred in the second third of the 18th century it occurred not in England it occurred not in France it occurred for the most part in Germany the common view of history and historical change is that we begin with the French dvtm An Elegant Century in which everything Begins by being calm and smooth rules that obeyed both in life and in art there is a general advance of reason rationality is progressing the church is retreating unreason is yielding to the great attacks upon it of the French philosoph there is peace there is harm there is elegant building there is a belief in Universal reason applying both to human Affairs and to Artistic practice to morals to politics to philosophy and then there is a sudden apparently unaccountable Invasion suddenly there is a violent eruption of immersion enthusiasm people become interested in Gothic buildings in intersection people will suddenly become neurotic and melancholy they begin to admire the unaccountable flights of spontaneous genius there is a general Retreat from this symmetrical elegant glossier State of Affairs at the same time other changes occur too the French great Revolution breaks out there is discontent a revolution breaks out the King has his head cut off the terror begins it's not quite clear what these two revolutions have to do with each other as we read history on her there is a general sense that something catastrophic occurred towards the end of the 18th century at first things appear to go comparatively smoothly then do a sudden breakthrough some will commit some denounce it those who denounce it suppose that this age should have been an arrogant peaceful age those who didn't know it didn't know the true um said others on the other hand say it was artificial and hypocritical age and the revolution usherdin A Reign of Greater Justice greater Humanity greater Freedom greater understanding of man for man well that's what may be the question is what is the relation of the so-called romantic Revolution the sudden breakthrough as it were in what might be called the Realms of author of morals of this new and and turbulent attitude and the revolution which is normally known as the French Revolution where the people who danced upon the ruins of the Bastille were the people who cut off the head of Louis the 16th were these the same persons as those who were affected by the sudden Cult of Genius or the sudden breakthrough of emotionalism of which were told all of a sudden disturbance and turbulence which suddenly flood the Western World apparently not certainly the principles in the in the name of which the French Revolution was fought were principles of universal reason of order of Justice not at all connected with the sense of uniqueness these profound emotional introspection the sense of the differences of things the dissimilarities rather than similarities with which the Romantic Movement is usually associated at this point someone will say what about Rousseau well Rusev of course in a sense is quite correctly attributed to the Romantic Movement as one of its fathers but the Rousseau who is responsible for the ideas of robustier the Russo who is responsible for the ideas of the French Jacobins is not Jerusalem it seems to me who has obvious connection with Romanticism that truth though is the Russo who wrote the social contract which is a classical Treatise a typically classical Treatise which speaks of the return of man to original those primary principles which all men have in common the reign of universal reason which unites men as opposed to emotions which divide him the reign of universal justice and Universal peace as against the conflicts and the turbulence and the disturbances which on the whole entire human hearts from the minds and divide men against themselves so that it's difficult to see what is the relation of this great romantic upheaval to the political revolution and then there is the Industrial Revolution too which cannot be regarded as irrelevant after all ideas don't breed ideas some social and economic factors are surely responsible for great upheavals in the human consciousness so we have on our hands a problem there is Industrial Revolution there is a great French political revolution under classical auspices and there is a romantic Revolution even if we look at the Arts if you look at the the great art of the French Revolution for example the great revolutionary paintings of David it's difficult to connect him specifically with a romantic Revolution the paintings of David have a kind of austere eloquence the austere Jacobin eloquence of a return to Spartans return to Romans something a protest against the frivolity and the superficiality of life which is connected with the preachings of such men as Machiavelli or Savanna arola or mabli people who denounced the frivolity of their age in the name of Eternal ideals of a universal kind whereas a Romantic Movement turned by all these historians was a passion that protest against universality of any kind and therefore there is prima face attenuate a problem to understand what happened in order to give you some sense of what it is that I regard as being this great breakthrough why I think that in those years say 1760 to 1830. something transforming occurred there was a great break in the European Consciousness in order to give you attenuate some preliminary evidence of why I think there is even a case for this let me give you an example of what I mean supposing you were traveling about Western Europe say in the 1820s and supposing in France you spoke to the avant-garde young men who were friends of Victor Hugo the ugolatry and supposing you went to Germany and spoke there to the people who had once been visited by Madame distal who had interpreted the German sale to the French supposing you would met the Schlegel brothers who were great theorists of the magic system oh let's just say the people one or two of the friends of Gerta in Weimar the fabulous and poet dick other persons connect with the Romantic Movement and their followers in the universities students young men painters sculptors who are deeply influenced by the work of these poets and these dramatists and these critics and supposing in England you had spoken to someone say by Killswitch and above all by Baron anyone influenced by Baron whether in England or France or Italy or beyond the Rhine or beyond the elbe the person who had spoken to these persons you would have found that that ideal of life was approximity of this kind that the values to which they attach the highest importance are such values as dedication to an ideal integrity sincerity Readiness to sacrifice one's life to some Inner Light to some ideal for which it is worth sacrificing all that one is for which it is worth both living and dying you would have found that they were not primarily interested say in knowledge say in the advantage of science not interested in political power not interested in happiness not interested above all in adjustment to life in finding your place in society in living at peace with your government in even in loyalty perhaps to your king or to your Republic you would have found that Common Sense moderation was very far from our thoughts you would have found that what they believed in was the necessity of fighting for whatever you believed in to the last breath in your body and you would have found that there were persons around the world believed in the value of martyrdom as such no matter what the martyrdom was martyrdom for you would have found that they believed that minorities were in some way marvelous majorities that failure was in a certain sense nobler than success which had certainly something shady and something vulgar about it you would have found the very notion of idealism which is not in its philosophical tense but in the ordinance sense which we use it idealism that is to say the State of Mind of a man who is prepared to sacrifice a great deal for principle or for some conviction who is not prepared to sell out who is prepared to go to the stake for something which he believes because he believes in it this attitude was relatively new and what people admired was wholeheartedness sincerity purity of Soul ability and Readiness to dedicate yourself for your ideal no matter what it was no matter what it was that is the important phrase which I wish to use supposing in the 16th century say you had a conversation with somebody engaged in the great religious wars which tore Europe apart at that period and supposing you said to let us say a Catholic of that period engaged in hostilities who said of course these Protestants believe what is false course to believe what they believe is to court perdition of course they are dangerous to the Salvation of human souls and which there is nothing more important but they are still sincere they die say originally for their cause their integrity is self-splendid one must yields that need Federation for the moral dignity and Sublimity of people who are prepared to do that such a sentiment would be unintelligible anyone who really knew suppose themselves to know the truth say a Catholic who believed in the truths preached him by the church would have known that person to Abel to put the hell of themselves into the theory and practice of falsehood were simply dangerous persons and the more sincere they were the more dangerous the more mad in a sense no Christian Knight would have supposed when he fought against a Muslim that he was expected to admire the Purity and the sincerity with which the Palin believed in that absurd doctrines no doubt if you were a decent person and you killed a brave anime you could you didn't well oblivious spit upon his corpse you um took the line that it was pitted at so much courage which was the University of marathology so much courage so much ability so much devotional should have gone to a cause so palpably absurd or dangerous but certainly you wouldn't have said it matters little what these people believe what matters is a state of mind which they believe it what matters is that they didn't sell out they were made of Integrity these are people I can respect if they had come over to our side simply in order to save themselves that would have been a very self-seeking a very prudent a very contemptible form of action this is the state of mind which people could say if I believe one thing and you believe another then it is important that we should fight each other Perhaps it is good that you should kill me or that I should kill you perhaps in a duel it is best to kill each other but the worst of all possible things is compromise because that means we've both betrayed the idea which is within us now martyrdom was always of course admired but murdered of the truth Christians admired Martyrs because there were witnesses to the truth even though witnesses to falsehood there was nothing admirable about them perhaps something repeated certainly nothing to be admired by the time you get to the 1820s the period which I speak you certainly get a frame of mind in which the State of Mind the motive is more important than the consequence the intention is more important than the effect the purity of heart Integrity devotional dedication all these things which we ourselves admire without much difficulty which is we've entered they speak into the very texture of our normal moral attitudes became more or less commonplace first among minorities gradually they spread outwards let me give you an example of what I mean by a shift take for example voltage on Muhammad well well table is not particularly interested Muhammad and the player Muhammad was really intended no doubt as an attack upon the church nevertheless muhammadel's play emerges as a superstitious cruel and fanatical monster who crushes all efforts at freedom and Justice at reason and is therefore to be denounced as an enemy of all that Voltaire Hills most important polarization Justice truth civilization and then consider about for example nothing very much later Carlisle has to say on the subject who in a sense is highly characteristic if someone exaggerated representative of the Romantic Movement he is described by Carlisle in the course of a book called Heroes and hero worship in the course which are great many heroes are enumerated and analyzed he Muhammad is described as a fiery massive life tossed up from the great bosom of nature itself he's a man of Blazing sincerity and power and therefore to be admired and what he is compared to what is not liked is the 18th century which is withered and useless the 18th century which took Carlisle as he calls it is a warped and second-rate century the Bible Muhammad is that Carlisle is not the least interested in the truths of the Quran it doesn't begin disappearance that the Quran does contain anything which he Carlyle could be expected to believe but what he admires Muhammad for is it is an elemental force that he lives an intense life that he has a great many followers with him that something Elemental occurred that in some way a tremendous phenomenon occurred there was a great movement so great and moving episode in the life of mankind was Muhammad in some way instantiates and the importance of Muhammad is his character and not his beliefs the question whether what Mohammed believed is true or false would repair to Carlisle perfectly irrelevant he says in the course of the same essays Dunst is Sublime Catholicism had to be torn asunder by Luther Shakespeare's Noble feudalism has to end in the French Revolution why does why do they have to do this because it doesn't matter whether the dentist Noble Catholicism or Sublime Catholicism either is not true the point is it's a great movement it is lasted its time and now something equally powerful equally Earnest equally sincere equally deep equally earth-shaking must take its place the importance of French Revolution is that it made a great Dent upon the consciousness of mankind that the man who made the French Revolution were deeply in Earnest and not simply a smiling Hypocrites as he thought voltaired to be now this is an attitude which I think is it I won't say brand new because it's too dangerous to say that but at any rate institution the news to be worthy of attention and whatever it was that caused it occurred it seems to be somewhere between the year 1760 in 1813 and it began in Germany then and grew a basic the important thing now is to consider what kinds of effects this kind of development had again I didn't wish to enumerate this because I propose to deal with the details of it in forthcoming lectures but take another example of the sort of things I need the attitude for example towards tragedy broadly speaking previous generations assumed that tragedy was always due to some kind of error someone got something wrong with it speak someone made a mistake either it was moral error or it was intellectual error it might have been avoidable or it might be unavoidable Greek tragedy was Era which the gods sent upon you which no man subject to whom could perhaps have avoided but in principle if these men been omniscient they would not have committed those grave errors which they did commit and therefore not have brought misfortunes upon themselves if Egypt was had known that Lions was his father he wouldn't have murdered him this is true even of the tragedies of Shakespeare at a certain degree if Othello had known that this demand was innocent none of the the normal of that particular tragedy could have occurred and therefore the tragedy is founded upon if you like the inevitable or perhaps avoidable lack of something in men knowledge skill ability to live moral courage ability to do the right thing when you see it or whatever it may be better men morally stronger intellectually more Adept above all omniscient persons who perhaps also had enough power could always avoid that which in fact is the substance of change this is not so for the early 19th century even from the late 18th if you read Schiller's tragedy of the robbers which I shall have to return again you will find that Carl Noir the hearer of that the hero villain of that he's a man who Avengers himself upon the detestable Society by becoming a brigand and committing a number of atrocious murders he is punished for it in the end but if you ask who is to blame is it the side which is which he comes it's values totally corrupt or on his values totally insane which of the two sides is right certainly there is no answer to be obtained in that tragedy and the Very question would appear to Schiller shallow and in some sense blind here there is a collision perhaps an unavoidable collision between sets of values which are literally incompatible trivial Generations supposed that all good things could in some way be reconciled this is true no longer if you read business tragedy the death of downtown in which robustier finally causes the death of downtown de mullah in the course of the Revolution and you ask was the robespier wrong to do this no the tragedy is such that downtown although he was a sincere revolutionary who committed certain errors didn't deserve to die and robbers there was perfectly right up and putting him to death in some sense you have a collision here of what Hegel after it's called good with good it doesn't do the error it's due to some kind of collusion or conflict of an unavoidable kind of loose elements wandering about the Earth in some way of values which couldn't in some sense be reconciled and what matters is that people should dedicate themselves to these values with all that is in them if they do that they are suitable Heroes for tragedy if they do not do that then there are Philistines then they are members of the bourgeoisie don't die no good and not worth writing about the figure who in some sense dominates a particular centuries image is get it Beethoven is a man who does what is in him he is poor he is ignorant he's bullish his manners are bad he knows little and he's perhaps not a very interesting figure outside the inspiration which drives him forward but the point about him is that he has not sailed out he sits in his get it and he creates he creates in accordance with the light which is within him and that is all that a man should do this is what makes a man a hero even if Beethoven was not a genius even if like the hero of balzax Masterpiece he is mad and covers his canvas with paints so in the end there is nothing intelligible at all just a fearful confusion of unintelligible irrational pain even then this figure is worthy of more than pity he's in some sense a man who has dedicated himself to an ideal who has thrown away the world who is in some sense represents the most heroic the most of sacrificing the most Splendid qualities which a human being can have when gutier in the famous introduction to Madness in I think 1835 defending the nursery says fools cretins this is addressed to the critics in general the public too full stretches you cannot make soup out of the book a novel is not a pair of books a sonnet is not a syringe a Brahma is not a railway a thousand times no no a thousand times no Gucci's point is that the old defense about quite apart from the particular School of Social utility which he's attacking Saint Simone utilitarians who are inject the object of attack and the Socialists apart from these the notion that the purpose of art for example is to give pleasure to a large number of persons or even to a small number of carefully trained condition is not true the purpose of art is to produce Beauty and if only the artist alone perceives that his object is beautiful that is a sufficient end to life clearly something occurred to have shifted Consciousness to this degree to have shifted it away from the notion these are Universal truths Universal canons of Art that in some sense all human activities were meant to terminate in getting things right and the criteria of getting things right were in some way public in some way demonstrable all intelligent Men by applying that intellects could discover them has shifted from that to a wholly different attitude towards life and towards action something clearly occurred we asked what we are told that again that there was a great turn towards emotionalism that there was a sudden interest in the Primitive and the remote the remote in time and remote in place that there was an outbreak of craving for the infinite something he said about emotional recollective and tranquility something he said but it's not clear what this has to do with any of the things which I've just mentioned with Scots novels Schubert songs delacroix the rise of State worship and German defense or German propaganda in favor of economic self-sufficiency also something to do with superhuman quantities admirational Royal genius Outlaws Heroes aestheticism self-destruction what have all these things in common if we try and discover the somewhat startling Prospect glitterview let me offer you some definitions of Romanticism which I've attempted to cuddle from the writings of some of the most imminent persons who have written on the subject and you will see that the subject is by no means easy standards is the Romantic is the modern and the interesting classicism is the old and the dull it isn't quite perhaps as simple as it sounds what he means is that Romanticism means understanding the forces which move in your own life as opposed to some Escape towards something which is obsolete however what he actually says in the book on the receiving Shakespeare is that which I'm just enunciate it namely the modern and the interesting whereas classicism is the old and the doubt but gorgeous is romanticism is disease it is the weak the sickly the battle cryover School of wild birds and Catholic reactionaries whereas classicism is strong fresh gay sound like Homer and the song of the nibelongs is it is not a disease but a therapy a cure for the disease since Monday who was Swiss critic of considerable imagination though not perhaps altogether friendly Romanticism in spite of being afraid of Madame de Style since Monday says that Romanticism is a union of Love religion and chivalry but gents who was metanis chief agent at this time in a precise contemporary of this Monday as goodev was indeed of standard some extent gent says that it is one of the heads of a three-headed Hydra the other two heads being reform and Revolution it's in fact a left-wing Menace and Men is the religion through the tradition and to the past which must be Stamped Out and the young French Romantics pleasure in France echoed this by saying Revolution against what apparently against everything says Romanticism is a passion flower sprung from the blood of Christ a Reawakening of the purity of the Middle Ages the sleepwalking Middle Ages dreaming spiers that look at you with deep dolorous eyes of grinning spectors and Marxist I think would add that was indeed an escape from the horrors of the Industrial Revolution and Ruskin I think would agree saying it is a contrast of the beautiful past with a frightful and the monotonous present which is a modification of heinous view but not all that different from it but says Romanticism is a Bourgeois revolt against aristocracy after 1789 Romanticism is the expression of the energy and force of the newer released the exact opposite it's it's it's it's the expression of the pushing vigorous powers of the new bourgeoisie against the old decent conservative values of society and history its expression not a weakness nor of Despair with a brutal optimism is the greatest Harbinger the greatest Herald of Romanticism that ever lived the greatest profit of itself there is a man a terrible unsatisfied desire to soar into Infinity a feverish longing to break through the narrow bonds of individuality and you will find messages not all together like this in Kill Ridge and indeed in Chile too but Professor gruntier towards the end of his Century says that it is literary egotism it is stressing individuality at the extents of a larger world it is the opposite of soft Transcendence it is sheer self-assession and the Battle of the Year adds yes and egomania and primitivism and Professor David of Harvard University Echoes this foreign both agreed that Romanticism comes from the romance Nations or at least the Romantic languages that it really comes from a modification of the verses of the provincial Troubadours but Renault says it's Celtic Gaston Paris says it comes from a mixture of Plato and pseudo-dient Professor Nadler who is a daily German critic says the dramaticism is rarely the homesickness of those Germans who live between the Arab and the Neiman their homesickness for the old Central Germany from which they once came the Daydreams of Exiles and colonists eichendorf says it is Protestant Nostalgia for the Catholic Church who didn't live between the Elven demon and therefore didn't experience these emotions says it is the secret of a soul playing with itself I speak everlastingly of myself and Professor Imam says it is the will to love something an attitude or an emotion towards others not towards oneself the very opposite of the will to power Middleton Marie says Shakespeare was essentially a romantic writer and adds all great writers since Rousseau have been romantic but the Emirate marks this critic Professor Georg lukage says no great writers are romantic least of all Scott Hugo and standard so that in a sense as you can see there is some difficulty in attenuity for people who takes these quotations by about men who after all have deserve to be to bread well in other respects profound and Brilliant writers many subjects there is some difficulty in discovering what it is that is a common element in all these generalizations that is why Professor fry was a very wise to warn against it uh and all these definitions so far as I know have never really been protested by anyone they've never incurred that degree of critical Roth which might have come to anyone who had really produced definitions or generalizations which were universally regarded as absurd and and irrelevant let me now go on to main the task which I next set myself which is to see what characteristics have on the whole being called romantic by writers on the subject by critics and a very peculiar results it is let me read what I've I've read there are no fewer than 10 categories which I accumulated I must ask you to bear with me while I read them out but I think they do throw light upon the subject at any way they indicate the extreme difficulty of the subject which I understand why is it to have chosen Romanticism is the Primitive the untoted it is Youth Life an exuberant sense of life of the natural man but it is also fever disease decadence the dance of death indeed death itself it is Shelley's Dome of any color glass and it is also his white Radiance of Eternity it is the confused

timelessness it is Nostalgia it is reverie it is the intoxicating dreams it is sweet Melancholy and bitter melancholy Solitude the sufferings of Exile the sense of alienation Roaming In remote places

the Great Society of the dead and the living and the yetan war it is the tourism of Scot and Saudi and Wordsworth and it is a radicalism of standal it is aesthetic medievalism and it is michelin's

vagueness of outline its beauty and ugliness it out for our sake and after his names through the social salvation strength and weakness individualism and collectivism Purity and Corruption Revolution and reaction peace and War love of life and love death it is perhaps not very surprising that faced with this professor Lovejoy who certainly scrupulous and one of the most Illuminating Scholars who ever dealt with the history of the idea of the last two centuries approach condition nearing despair he said that not only were all these terms of romantic thoughts that she was able to unravel some of them contradict the others which is late in the true some totally irrelevant to the others but he took two specimens of what nobody would deny to be Romanticism for example primitivism and he and the other eccentricity dangerous might ask what they hadn't come primitivism which began in English and partly English programs at the beginning of 18th century celebrates the noble savage the simple life The Irregular patterns of spontaneous action as against the corrupt sophistication and Alexandra inverse of a highly sophisticated Society it's an attempt to demonstrate that there is natural law which can be discovered best in the untouched heart of the uncorrupted Native of the uncorrupted child and this professor Lovejoy quite intelligently what is this in common with red wasted blue hair green wigs absent death suicide and journal eccentricity of the followers of near Valley and he concludes by saying that he really doesn't see what there is in common to these and one one and one can sympathize with him well you might say perhaps you might perhaps say that there is an air of Revolt in birth both have revolted against some kind of civilization some in order to get some Robinson Cruiser Island there to um commune with nature and live among uncorrupted simple people and the other in some kind of violent aestheticism in the indianism but mere Revolt cannot be romantic mere denunciation of corruption cannot be romantic we don't regard the Hebrew Prophet as particularly romantic we don't regard seven Aroma as particularly romantic we don't even regard Methodist preachers as particularly romantic and therefore this I think is too wide remark one therefore his certain sympathy with truth lovejoy's despair in this matter let me read you a passage which his disciple Professor Boaz also of Johns Hopkins University wrote I'll prepare this after the Discrimination of romanticisms made by Lovejoy there ought to be no further discussion of what Romanticism really was there happens to be a variety of aesthetic doctrines some of which were logically related to others and some of which were not all called by the same name but this fact does not imply that they all had a common Essence any more than the fact that hundreds of people are called John Smith means that they are all of the same parentage this is perhaps the most common and misleading error arising from confusion of ideas and words one could speak for hours about it alone and perhaps one should but at the same time I think the best Professor love joy and Professor barriers are eminent Scholars they are and greater their contribution has been towards illumination of thought uh on this mistaken there was a Romantic Movement it has something which was Central to it it did create a great evolution in Consciousness and it is important to discover what this is one can of course give up the whole game one can say like Valerie words like Romanticism the classicism words like humanism and naturalism are not words are not named with which I could operate at all one cannot get drunk one cannot quench one's test with labels and bottles and finally there is much to be said to this point of view at the same time I think unless we do use some generalizations it is impossible to trace the cause of human history and therefore difficult as it may be it is important to find out what it was that caused this enormous revolution in human consciousness which appears to be difficult in those centuries there are people who I think faced with this plethora of evidence which I've attempted to collect may feel some sympathy for the late rather cooler coach who said with typical British breeziness the whole puzzle about the difference of classical romantic amongst to nothing that need trouble a healthy man I can't deny I can't deny that I don't share this point at all it appears to me it appears to me to be excessively defeated and therefore because of these lectures I attempt I should make do my best to try and explain what in my view the Romantic Movement fundamentally came to I think the only thing and the only sensible way of approaching it at least the only way that I've ever found to be helpful at all is by slow and patient Historical Method by looking at the beginning of the 18th century and considering what the situation was then and then considering what the factors were which undermined it one by one and what the particular combination of Confluence the factors was would by 1760 by 1717 by 1780 caused what appears to me to be the greatest transformation of the western Consciousness certainly in our time thank you very much indeed last time I said then I would speak today about the attack delivered on the ideal of the Enlightenment at any rate the beginning of it I think it would be only fair to tell you what the general program of these lectures is to be I shall today discuss the first Onslaught upon the enlightenment next time I propose to continue with that and in particular to deal with the attitudes and the ideas and the effects of the ideas of Russo Kant and Schiller in the fourth lecture I propose to deal with the rise the real full blast effect of Romanticism both upon the Arts and upon literature and on thought and life in the fifth lecture I prepared to deal with a specific results of it in the early 19th century and in particular in France and in the last lecture I propose to try and draw a summary of all that I've said and consider what parts of it are alive and what parts of it did for us now and what effect it has had is having and even perhaps is likely to have upon our own lives let me now forget back to the subject of which I spoke the enlightenment of the late 17th and early 18th century needs some definition there are certain propositions if you like to boil them down to that which are as it were the three legs upon which the whole Western tradition rested these are not confined to the enlightenment although the enlightenment gave a particular version transformed them in a particular manner these three principles are roughly these that all genuine questions can be answered that if a question cannot be answered it is not a question we may not know what the answer is someone else will we may be too weak or too stupid or too ignorant to be able to discover the answer for ourselves in that case the answer May perhaps be known to persons wiser than we experts in the elite of some sort we may be sinful creatures and therefore incapable of ever arriving at the truth by ourselves in that case we should not know it in this world but perhaps will in the next or perhaps it was known to some golden age before the fall and the flood had rendered us as weak and as sinful as we are or perhaps the golden age is not in the past but in the future and we shall discover the truth then if not here there if not now at some other time but in principle the answer must be known if not to men that attenuate to Indonesian being to God if the answer is not knowable at all if the answer is in some way is in principle shrouded from us then there must be something wrong with the question this is a proposition which is common both to Christian and to Scholastic to Enlightenment and to positivist tradition of today it is in fact the backbone of what might be called the main Western tradition and it is this that Romanticism in a sense cracked the second proposition is that all these answers are knowable that to say they can be discovered by means which can be learned and taught to other persons so there are techniques by which it is possible to learn and to teach ways of discovering what the world consists of what part we occupy in it what our relation is to people what our relation is to things what True Values are and every other serious and answerable question the third proposition is that all the answers must be compatible with one another because if they aren't compatible then chaos will result it is clear that the true answer to one question cannot be incompatible with a true answer to another question it is a logical truth that one true proposition cannot contradict another if all answers to all questions are to be put in the form of propositions and if all true propositions are in principle discoverable then it must follow that there is a description of an ideal universe Utopia if you like which simply is that which is described by all true answers to all serious questions and this Utopia is something which although we may not be able to attain to it attenuate is that ideal in terms of which we can measure off our own present imperfections that is the general presupposition if you like of the rationalist western tradition whether Christian or Pagan whether theist or atheist now the particular twist which the enlightenment gave to it was to say that the answers were not to be obtained in many of the hitherto traditional ways I needn't dwell on that for a little bit familiar to most people here the answer is not to be obtained by Revelation for different men's Revelations appear to contradict each other then it's not to be obtained by tradition because tradition can be shown to be often misleading and false it is not to be obtained by Dogma it is not to be obtained by individual self-inspection of men of a privileged type because too many imposters have usurped this role and so forth there is only one way of discovering these answers and that is by the correct use of reason deductively as in the mathematical Sciences inductively as in The Sciences of nature that is the only way in which answers in general true answers to serious questions may be obtained and there is no reason why these answers which after all have produced triumphant results in the worlds of physics and chemistry should not equally apply to the much more troubled fields of politics ethics and Aesthetics yeah the general pattern I wish to test of this notion is that life in some sense or nature if you like and when 70th and 18th century authors say nature we can translate that into life perfectly easily the word nature was as much a common place in 18th century as the word creative is now and had about as precise a meaning at any rate the notion of life and of nature I mean is that of a jigsaw puzzle we lie among the as it were dejected fragments of this puzzle there must be some means of putting these bits together the old wise man the omniscient being God or the omniscient Earthly creature whichever way you would like to conceive it is in principle capable of fitting all the various bits together into one coherent pattern anyone who fits things into one coherent pattern will know what the world is like what things are what they have been what they will be what the laws are would govern it what man is what the relation of man is to things and therefore what man needs what he desires and also how to obtain it all questions whether of a factual nature or what we call a normative nature that is to say answers to questions what should I do and what Otay to do or what would it be right or appropriate for me to do all these questions are answerable by someone who is capable of fitting these bits of the jigsaw puzzle it is as it were like a hunt for some kind of concealed treasure the only difficulty is to find the path to the treasure upon this of course theorists have different but in the 18th century there was a fairly wide consensus that what Newton had achieved in the region of physics could surely also be applied to the regional ethics and politics the regions of ethics and of politics presented a rare disorder it was perfectly clear I mean then as now that people didn't know what the answer to these questions were how should one live where a Public's preferable to monarchies was it right to seek pleasure or to do one's duty or could they be reconciled um was it right to be aesthetic or was it right to be a voluptuary was it proper to obey Elites of Specialists who knew the truth or was it the case that every man had the right to his own particular opinion as to what to do and what the majority opinion of necessity to be taken as the correct answer to political life but was the good something which was intuited as an external property as something which was out there Eternal objective true for all men in all circumstances everywhere or was the good only something which a particular person in a particular situation happened to like or happen to be inclined towards these questions were then as now of a positive nature it was quite natural that people should say here was Newton who had found physics in a very similar state with a great many crisscrossing hypotheses founded upon a great deal of classical and Scholastic error with a very few Master destructs he had managed to reduce this enormous chaos to competitive order from a very few clear physical mathematical propositions he was able to deduce the position and the velocity of every particle in the universe or if not to deduce them to place weapons in people's hands with which they could if they applied themselves deduce them weapons which any intelligent man could in principle use for himself surely if this kind of order could be Institute in the world the physics the same methods produce equally Splendid and Lasting results in the worlds of morals politics Aesthetics and the rest of the chaotic world of human opinion where people appear to struggle with each other and murder each other and destroy each other and humiliate each other in the name of incompatible principles this appeared to be a very reasonable hope and it appeared to be a very worthy human ideal at any rate this is certainly the idea of the Enlightenment now the enlightenment was certainly not as sometimes maintained a kind of uniform movement in which or which all the members believed approximately the same things for example opinions about human nature differed very widely Fontenelle and it's not every more Voltaire and lametri thought that man was hopelessly jealous envious Wicked corrupt and weak and therefore needed the most strenuous possible discipline in order to keep his head just above water as we speak he needed in other words a rigid discipline for the purpose of making him capable of coping with life at all others on the other hand the thought on the contrary didn't take quite so black of you and thought that man was essentially a malleable substance clay which any competent educator any enlightened legislator could meld into perfectly proper and rational shape and there were of course a few persons like Rousseau and others who thought that man was naturally neither neutral nor Wicked but in fact good and had only been ruined by institutions of his own making and if these institutions could be altered or reformed in a very drastic way man's natural goodness would burst forth and the reign of Love could be once again created upon the Earth again some imminent doctrinaires of the Enlightenment believed in the immortality of the Soul others believed that the notion of the Soul was a hollow Superstition and there was a such entity some believed in for example the Elites in the necessity of government by the wise that the mob would never learn that it was an inequality of gifts which was permanent among Mankind and unless men could somehow be trained to obey experts as they obey experts in for example those techniques which clearly need them such as let us say navigation or economics or whatever it may be unless men could be induced to obey those who knew the elite of experts life on Earth would continue to be a jungle others on the other hand believed that in matters of ethics and of politics every man was his own expert that while not everyone could be a good mathematician all men by inspecting their own Hearts could know the difference between good and evil right and wrong and only didn't know it because they had been misled by names or fools in the past by self-interested rulers Wicked soldiers corrupt priests and other enemies of man and that if these persons could be eliminated or liquidated in some way then every man could be placed in a situation where these clear answers could be discovered by every man written in Eternal letters upon grave and eternal letters upon his own heart as in fact Rusev preached and there were other disagreements as well into which I didn't go but what I think is common to them all is the view that virtue consists ultimately in knowledge that if we know what we are and we know what we need and we know where to obtain it and we obtain it by the best means in our possession then we can live happier virtuous just free and contented lives that all their tools are in fact compatible with one another that it is impossible for it to be the case that the answer to the question should one seek Justice is yes and the answer to the question should one seek Mercy is yes and that these two answers should somehow prove incompatible equality Liberty fraternity must be compatible with one another so must mercy and Justice it is impossible if a man were to say that for example the truth could make someone miserable this must somehow be demonstrated to be false if it could be shown that in some way total Liberty was incompatible with total equality there must be some misunderstanding in the argument and so on this was a belief which I think all these men held and above all the health that these General propositions were obtainable by the Dependable methods used by natural scientists in the establishing of the great Triumph of the 18th century namely the Natural Sciences this I think qualifies them all now before I go on to the to the particular form of attack upon it let me explain to you that this of course penetrates as much into the realm of the Arts as it does into that with sciences and that of ethics uh for example if you ask what was the dominant aesthetic theory of the early 18th century the dominant aesthetic theory was that man should hold up the mirror to Nature spoken like that it seems a rather tedious attitude in fact a falsehood to hold up a mirror to Nature's married a copy what is already there these people I don't think meant that by this particular phrase by Nature they meant life and by life they made not rapunzor but that towards which they supposed life to strive set in ideal forms towards which all life was tending no doubt it was a clever thing on the part of the painter zuxis in Athens to paint birds so realistically to paint up solid grapes so realistically little birds came to pick at them it was very skillful on the part of Raphael to paint gold pieces so skillfully that the Innkeeper thought them to be genuine and let him go without paying his account but these were not the highest flights of human artistic genius the highest flight human artistic genius consisted in somehow visualizing that inner objective ideal towards which nature and man tended and somehow embodying this in a noble painting that is to say there is some kind of universal pattern and this Universal pattern the artist is able to incorporate images as the philosopher or the scientist is capable of incorporating in propositions let me read to a very typical statement by Fontenelle who is the most representative of all figures of the Enlightenment and let a very careful and very rational life which enabled him to live to the age of 100. he said a work of politics morals criticism possibly even of literature will be finer All Things Considered is made by the hands of a geometer that is because geometers are persons who understand the rational interrelationships of things and anybody who understands the pattern which nature follows because nature is surely a rational entity otherwise man would not be able to conceive it or understand it at all that was the argument if anyone who can do that is surely able to elicit from their parent chaos and confusion of nature those Eternal principles those necessary connections which bind together the Eternal and objective elements out of which the the world is composed in the 17th century said Aristotle's Poetics is only nature reduced method Good Sense reduced to principle and Pope repeated that in famous lines saying those rules of old discovered not devised are nature still but nature methodized that is roughly speaking the official doctrine of the 18th century namely that you discover the method in nature herself Reynolds who are supposed to misrepresentative aesthetic theorists certainly in England of his period in 18th century said the painter correct Nature by herself an imperfect state by homo perfect he makes out an abstract idea of forms more perfect than any one in the original this is the famous ideal beauty by which he says by this fidias acquired his Immortal Fame therefore we must understand what it is that nature what the ideal consists of the ideal is there are certain persons for example who are more imminent than others an example of the great is the most tended figure than a lame or blind beggar and therefore deserves more of the artists than the labor blind beggar who is a mere accident of nature nature tends towards Perfection we know what Perfection is by some inner sense which tells us what is Norm and what is abnormal what is the ideal and what is the deviation of this idea therefore since Reynolds is a great feminist if Alexander had happened to be of low stature do not render himself Bernini should never have let David bite his lower lip because that is a mean expression inappropriate to Royal rank if if some Paul was of mean appearance as we are told Raphael was right not so to draw him in Perot writing is towards the end of the 18th century says it's a great pity that Homa allows his Heroes to be too familiar with swine herds he doesn't I suppose that doesn't push the deny that perhaps him as heroes or persons whom he drew or his Originals Mighty bill is familiar with fine herds as in fact they are represented as being but if so there shouldn't have been and The Business of the painter is not simply realistically to reproduce what is there that is what the Dutch too often do and this merely populates the world with a number of copies of entities which originally had no need to be there the the the the purpose of painting is to convey to the questing intellect or the questing soul what it is that nature seeks after nature seeks after Beauty and Perfection all these people believe that it may not have attained to it particularly man conspicuously had not attained to it but by inspecting nature we observe the general lines upon which he proceeds we see what it is that she's trying to produce we know the difference between the stunted Oak and the fully grown Oak we know when we call it stunted that it is an oak which has failed to become that which it was as it were intended by itself or by nature to be in the same way there are objective ideals of beauty of gender of magnificence of wisdom which is the business of writers philosophers preachers painters sculptors composers to in some way to convey to us that is the general notion Winkleman who I suppose is the most the most original of all the aesthetic theories of the century and who introduced this passionate nostalgic taste for classical art Winkleman speaks about Noble tranquility and calm restraint why noble Tranquility why can't restraint he doesn't anymore than anyone else suppose that all the entrants were nobly tranquil or calmly restrained but he does think that this is the ideal of what man should be he does think that to be a Roman Senator to be a Greek orator whatever it is that he regarded as the Perfection of man what all the Germans study in his time tended to think of as the most perfect name were persons who tended towards this noblest of human ideals and the sculptors who in this way immortalized these particular Trails build up before us the ideal of what man can be and in this way not only Inspire us to imitate these ideals but reveal to us the inner purposes of nature revealed towards reality reality life nature ideal these things are identical for these particular thinkers just as mathematics deals in perfect circles so the sculpture and the painter must deal in ideal forms this I think is the rational the Russian this notion of most 18th century Aesthetics that is why there is a competitive neglect of History although it's true that Voltaire was the first person who began to write history no longer of individual Kings and conquerors and captains and adventurers but took an interest in people's morals like clothes their habits their judicial institutions although some interest in what might be called the general history of people's manners as well as individual conquests the treaties had got going in the 18th century nevertheless there is no doubt that when bulling Brook said that history was nothing but philosophy teaching by examples he was voicing a very common view well Tara's interest in history was to show how men were much the same in most ages and how the same causes produce the same effects and the purpose of that was to show sociologically what we were like what kind of ends men sought after what kind of means did not bring them about what kind of means did bring them about and in this way to create some kind of Science of how to live well the same is true of you who also spoke in much of the same way he said most men in most circumstances is obeying the same causes behaving roughly in the same fashion the purpose of history is not simply curiosity about what happened in the past desire to revive something which occurred in the past simply because we feel passionately interested in what our ancestors were like or because we wish in some way to connect the past with ourselves to see what it was that we grew out of that I think was not the principle spring of these men's interests the principal spring was simply an accumulation of data upon which general propositions could be constructed telling one what to do how to live what to be that is a historical possible attitude which can be taken towards history and it is the Fairly characteristic attitude of the 18th century including great historians who despite themselves wrote great history like Gibble whose ideals were a great gradual in Syria to his actual performance now these things General relations with the enlightenment you can see that in the case of the Arts it would lead to speak to the formal the noble the symmetrical the proportional the judicials there were of course exceptions to this I don't say that everybody believes exactly the same thing this is very uncommon in any age even in France Even In classical France there were all kinds of quietest and convulsionist persons of hysterical or ecstatic temperament there were people like wovenard who said who complained bitterly about the appalling emptiness of Life there was Madame de Republic who said she wished to throw herself out of the window because she felt that life had no meaning and no purpose but these were comparatively speaking a minority broadly speaking it could be said that it was Voltaire and his friends people like rositos people to a certain extent like like fontanelle who represented what might be called the major position of the age and this was that we were progressing we were discovering we were destroying ancient Prejudice Superstition ignorance and cruelty and we were well on the way towards establishing some kind of science which would make people happy free virtuous and just it was really this that was attacked by the person about to discuss next now certain cracks in what might be called this rather Smooth Wall rather snug and Smooth Wall in some ways had already proceeded from the enlightenment itself for example motor skill was a very typical representative of the Enlightenment had suggested that men were not the same everywhere and this proposition which had already been offered by a good many Greek's office that had been forgotten I think intermediate in a certain sense did make a sort of dent in the general picture though not a very deep part his point was that if you were a person and brought up in the personal conditions you might not want what you would want if you were a Parisian and brought up in Paris that men were not made Happy by the same things so they attempt to foist upon the Chinese things which delighted the French or upon the French things which delighted the Chinese would cause misery in both places and the Darfur one had to be really careful in altering laws in reforming in generally speaking looking after people if one was a Statesman or a politician or even in personal relations in friendship and family life to consider very carefully what are the actual needs what is the process of growth what is the particular what are the conditions in which a specific body of persons grew up he attached enormous importance to soil climate and political institutions others attached importance to other factors But whichever way you look at it the general notion was that original relativism that what did for people in Birmingham would not do for people in bakara roughly speaking now in the sense of course this did contradict the proposition that there were certain objective uniform Eternal fixed entities for example certain forms of uh which pleased everyone everywhere that there were certain true propositions which all men at all times could have discovered themselves but then he failed to do because they were too stupid or placed in unfortunate circumstances so there is a form of life which once it is introduced into the universe could be made could be as it were fixed as Eternal would not need to be altered because it was perfect because it satisfied the permanent interest in desires of men it did contradict that but it didn't contradict it very sharply all it said was that all men in fact thought the same thing namely happiness contentment Harmony Justice Liberty none of this he denied but different circumstances made different means of attaining it necessary this was a very sensible remark and didn't in principle contradict the foundations of the Enlightenment he did make an observation which did shock people he said when Montezuma said to Cortes that the Christian religion was all very well sustained but that the Aztec religion might be best for his people what he said was not absurd this of course did shock both parties it shocked the Roman church and it shocked the left wing it shocked the rheumatoid for obvious reasons it shocked the left wing because they too knew that since the Catholic what the Catholic Church said was false the opposite was true since was the Aztec religion said it was false the opposite was true and therefore the notion that propositions which might not themselves appear true to us yet might do for some other culture that in fact one ought to estimate the value of religious truths not in accordance with some objective standard of truth but some much more flexible or pragmatic means namely whether it made the people who believed in them happy if suited that way of life developed certain ideals among them fitted into the general texture of their life and their experience that did appear to both sides both the Roman Church and the atheistic of materialists as being in some sense a betrayal nevertheless this is roughly speaking the kind of criticism much more to skill abroad and as I say it modified the picture somewhat it did modify the proposition that the word Eternal truths Eternal institutions Eternal Daniels suitable of everyone everywhere you had to be more flexible you had to say well not Eternal perhaps not everywhere most people in those places with due adjustment made for time and place but if we did that you could still preserve the foundations of the viewers of the Enlightenment somewhat deeper breach was made by Hume in this very intelligent interesting amusing and remarkable book The Heavenly city of the 18th century philosophers the late professor Becca thinks that Hume really blew up the entire Enlightenment position by showing that the Necessities in which these philosophers believed that the network of rigorous logical relationships out of which the universe consisted and which reason could grasp and live by that this was not true and therefore he somehow undermined the general notion of a kind of seamless garment or Harmony of necessary connections I don't agree with you about this but I don't wish to go into this in detail here Humes Chief service in the attack on the enlightenment consisted and it was he certainly didn't appear to himself to be doing this consisted in doubting whether two propositions one whether the causal relationship was something which we directly perceived or indeed knew to exist at all he said that so far from things being necessitated by other things they just followed along in a regular manner without being necessitated instead of saying causes must produce effects or this event must produce that event or this situation cannot help arising that situation all you needed to say was usually the situation follows this situation normally this thing is to be found before or at the same time as or after that thing so that for factual purposes it didn't make original difference the second proposition more important for our purposes is that when he asked himself how he knew that there was an external world at all he said he couldn't deduce it logically there was no way of demonstrating the tables existed there was no way of demonstrating that At This Moment's at home I am eating an egg or I am drinking a glass of water demonstrating no I can demonstrate things in Geometry I can demonstrate things in arithmetic I can demonstrate things in logic I might I suppose be able to demonstrate things in heraldry or chess or other Sciences which follow from artificial rules conventionally established but I can't prove with mathematical certainty that anything exists all I can say is that if I ignore it I shall Brew it if I prepare if I suppose that there is no table in front of me and walk into it I shall probably suffer discomfort but demonstrate it in the in the sense in which I could demonstrate mathematical propositions demonstrated in the sense in which I can demonstrate a proposition in logic where the opposite is not merely false but meaningless that I cannot do and therefore I must accept the world unbelief on trust belief is not the same as deductive certainty indeed reduction doesn't apply no matter the fact at all well without going into the vast consequences with this head in the general history of logic and a philosophy it clearly did weaken the general position According to which the universe was a rational whole each part of which was as it was necessarily because it was necessitated by the other parts of it and the whole thing was made beautiful and rational by the fact that none of the things in it could be otherwise and as they were the old belief was that whatever is true was necessarily true that things could not be otherwise and as they were and that is why sub Spinoza and people who thought like him when I understand that things are inevitable I accept them much more willingly no man wants to believe that two plus two equals five anyone who says two plus two was always equal to four but this is a very suffocating truth cannot could it not be the case occasionally the two plus two would be four and a half or 17. anyone who wants to break out of this hideous prison of the multiplication table would be regarded on the whole as not quite sane on the whole we assume that the proposition of two plus two equals four or that if a is larger than B and B is larger than C then it is probable that a is larger than C these kind of propositions are propositions which we accept as being part of the general rational process of thought part of what we mean by sanity by nationality if all facts in the universe could be reduced to this then we would no longer kick against them that is the great rationalist presupposition if all the things which represent you hate a new fear could be self-represented as to Flower by necessarily logical chains from everything else in there was you would accept it as being not only inevitable but reasonable and therefore delightful as much as two plus two equals four or any other logical truth upon which you found your life rests that is the ideal of rationalism this tomb certainly broke now let me now say that in spite of the fact that motor skilled Hume did make these same dents in the particular Theory which I speak one by sharing that not everything was everywhere the same the other by saying there were no Necessities only probabilities the difference that made was not very large Hume certainly thought that the Universe had proceed much as it did he certainly thought there were rational irrational causes of action he certainly thought that men could have made Happy by rational means he believed in science he believed in reason he believed in Cruel judgment he believed that all the well-known propositions of the 18th century he believed in art Executives Reynolds believes in it exactly as Dr Johnson believed in it The Logical implications of these ideas didn't really become evident until the late 19th and 20th Century the attack of which I wish to speak came from a very different quarter the attacker which I was to speak came from the Germans now the truth about the Germans in the 70s and 18th century is that they are somewhat backward province they don't wish to take themselves in this light but it remains true that they were in the 16th century the Germans were as Progressive and as Dynamic and as generous contributors to European culture as anyone else certainly durable was the greatest painter as an European plate of his time certainly Luther was great if a religious figure as anyone who would occurred in European history but if you look at Germany in the 17th century for whatever reason and particularly the early 18th century with the exception of the one great figure of leiblitz who certainly is a philosopher of a world scale it is very difficult to see who among government thinkers or who among those Germans who affected should speak the thought or the even even to a certain degree the art of the world in any significant fashion particularly towards the end of the 17th century could be named what the reason for this is is rather difficult to say I'm not a completely stored in and I therefore don't altogether I don't wish to volunteer too much but it does seem as if in for some reason or other the Germans failed to achieve centralized statehood as England and France and even Holland achieved it they were governed in the 18th century and in the 17th by 300 princes and 1200 sub-princes the emperor had interest in Italy and elsewhere which prevented him from paying dual attention perhaps to his German lands and above all there was the violent dislocation of the 30 years war in the course of which the troops of Louis XIV and of others destroyed and killed a very large section of the German population and crushed What Might Have Been a cultural development simply in Seas of blood this was a misfortune of an unexampled kind in European history and such a number of persons had never been killed for any reason before since the days of Genghis Khan and The Misfortune to Germany was trashing and it crushed us did it to a very high degree with the result for one reason or another they're German culture became provincialized became disrupted into the tiny stuffy provincial courts there was no Paris there was no Center there was no life there was no Pride there was no sense of gross dynamism and Power German culture drifted into either extreme Scholastic bendry of a Lutheran kind and scholarship our minute but rather dry kind or else into revealed against the scholarship in the direction of the inner life of the human soul this was no doubt stimulated by Lutheranism as such but particularly by the fact that there was a kind of huge National inferiority complex which I think began at that period vis-a-vis the great Progressive Western States vis-a-vis particularly the French This brilliant glittering state which has managed to crush and humiliate them this great country which dominated The Sciences and the Arts and all the provinces of human life were the kind of arrogance and success unexampled hitherto and this did plant in Germany a permanent sense of sadness and humiliation which may be discovered in its rather sad German literature Ballard literature and popular literature of the end of the 17th century and even in the Arts in which the Germans excelled even in music which tends to be domestic religious passionate Inward and above all different from the gittering court art and The Splendid secular achievements of composers like Rambo and Cupra there's no doubt that if you compare someone like Bach and his contemporaries and telemund with French music with that period even though Bach's genius is incomparably greater the whole atmosphere the whole tones that speak of his music is much more confined to the particular when the provincialism which generate the sort of in our religious life of the city of Leipzig or whatever it might have happened to live and was not intended to be an offering before the glittering courts of Europe or the general admiration of mankind in the way in which the paintings and the musical compositions of English the Dutch the French and the other leading nations of the world so intended at any rate that is what occurred and the Piet is movement of which I wish to say a few words because it really is the root of Romanticism the Pirates movement became deeply embedded in Germany pietism was a branch of Lutheranism and it consisted in careful study of the Bible profound respect for the personal relationship of man to God therefore emphasis upon the spiritual life contempt for learning contempt for ritual and for form contempt for Pump and ceremony and tremendous emphasis upon the individual relationship of the individual suffering human soul with her makeup Arnold all these founders of the Pirates movement where men who in some way managed to bring comfort and salvation to a large collection of socially crushed and politically miserable human beings so that in a certain sense what occurred with the kind of retreat in depth let me tell you that it's all it sometimes happens in human history even though parallels may be dangerous that when the natural road towards human fulfillment is in some way blocked human beings Retreat into themselves become wrote up in themselves and try and create inwardly that world which some evil state has denied them externally this is certainly what happened in ancient Greece when Alexander the Great began to destroy the city-states and the stakes and epicureans began to preach immorality of personal salvation which took the form of saying that politics was unimportant Civil Life was unimportant all these great ideals held up by pedicles and by demosthenese by Plato and by Aristotle where trivial and as nothing before the imperative need of personal individual salvation this was really a very Grand form of sour grapes if you cannot obtain if you cannot obtain that which already deserve in the world you must teachers have not wanted if you cannot get what you want you must teach yourself to want what you can get this is a very frequent form of so to speak the spiritual Retreat and depth into a kind of inner Citadel in which you try and lock yourself up against all the fearful ills of the world the king of my Province the prince confiscates my land I don't want to own land the prince doesn't wish to give me rank rank is Trivial and important the King has robbed me of my possessions possessions are nothing my children have died of malnutrition and disease Earthly possessions even children love of children is there's nothing before love of God and so forth so that you gradually hid yourself around by a kind of tight wall in which you seek to reduce the vulnerable surface you want to be as little wounded as possible every kind of wound is being heaped upon you and therefore you wish to contact yourself into the smallest possible area so that as little of you as possible is exposed to wounds this is in a sense the mood in which the German Piet is operated and the result of that was an intense inner life a great deal of very moving and very interesting but highly personal violently emotional literature hatred of the intellect and above all of course violent hatred of France of wigs of silk stockings of salons of Corruption of generals of Emperors of all the great and and magnificent figures of this world who are simply incarnations of wealth wickedness of the devil this is a natural reaction since we got the part of a Pious and humiliated population and this happens since since that day in other places as well it's a particular form so to speak of Intercultural anti-intellectualism and xylophobia to which the Germans were at that particular moment particularly prone this is the provincialism which some of the German thinkers cherished and adored in the 18th century and against which Gerta and Schiller fought all their lives now let me give you a typical quotation I think from cincinnatf who I suppose was the leader of the Heron bhuta which was a sort of section of the Moravian Brotherhood which was a large section of the piety's population of the pietist group he said whoso wishes to grasp god with his intellect becomes an atheist and this was simply an echo of Luther who said reason is a it must be avoided now let me give you another essential fact about these Germans which I think is not all together irrelevant if you ask who were the Germans of the 18th century who were the thinkers who most influenced Germany and who of whom we have heard there is a broad peculiar sociological fact about them which in a sense supports the thesis which I wish to put before you which is that it's the whole thing is a product of wounded National sensibility and of dreadful National humiliation on the parts of the Germans if you ask who that thinkers were you will find that in contrast to the French they came from an entirely different social media listening and can't hear the were all very humbly born middle class was a rich Bourgeois but only attained to a proper title later only Christ in novales were what would in those days be called country gentlemen the only persons with any degree of aristocratic connection which could be said to take part in German literature German life German painting any kind of German civilization whom I could discover where the two brothers counts counts stallberg and the Mystic Baron eckert'shausen not exactly first class figures not exactly figures the front rank if on the other hand you think about the French of this period of all the radicals the left wing the most extreme um opponents of Orthodoxy of the Church of the monarchy of the status quo all these persons came from a very very different world montessor was a baron kondiac with account condors Buffon became account volne was well born and served was the illegitimate son of a noble Road helvisions was not Noble but his father had been Dr to Madame and he was a millionaire and a tax farmer and moved in court circles from their Bohemia there were a certain number of abesaliani was the secretary at the Neapolitan Embassy were of good origin even Voltaire was came to the minor Gentry only diedro only didro and Rousseau were commonless real commoners really did come from the poor and Rusev was a Swiss and therefore doesn't count in this particular category and consequently the point I wish to make is that these peasants spoken with a different language they were no doubt oppositional but they were oppositional against persons who came from the same class as themselves they went to salons they glittered they were persons of high polish great education and Splendid Pro style and generous and handsome Ultron lives and their mere existence irritated humiliated and infuriated the Germans came to Paris in the early 70s he was unable to get into contact with any of these men it appeared to him that they were all artificial highly mannered extremely self-conscious dry soulless little dancing Masters and salons who had no soul who didn't understand the inner life of man who didn't understand what the purpose of human beings were who in some way were the bird by either their Doctrine or by false origin from understanding the true purposes of men on earth and the true potentialities the true rich and generous potentialities which human beings had been endowed with God this in a certain sense also created a Chasm between the Germans and the French so the mere thought of these from the near thought of this opposition even on the part of those who themselves hated the Church of Rome and themselves hated the king of France um the mere thought of these people filled them with nausea disgust humiliation and inferiority and this dug an enormous ditch between the Germans and the French which not all the cultural interchangers which can be traced by scholars in fact were able to overcome this I think is perhaps one of the roots of the German opposition to the French from which Romanticism began now let me tell you a few words in the time left to me about the man who in my view is was really the man who struck the most violent blow at the Enlightenment and began the whole romantic process the whole presence of revolt against a particular World which I've to some extent tried to draw his lips sometimes create great consequences during a certain portion of his life Johann was the son of very obscure parents his father was like a boss keeper in the city of koenigsberg and he was brought up in East Prussia in a pietist environment he was another wheel he wasn't able to get a job he was wrote a little poetry written criticism he did it quite well but not well enough to secure a living he was supported by his neighbor and friend Emmanuel Kant who lived in the same city the rest of his life and then he was sent by some rich Baltic Merchants to London for the purpose of transacting a piece of business which he failed to complete but instead drank gambled and got into heavy debt as a result of these excesses he was near suicide and then had the religious experience read the Old Testament which is pietist parents and grandparents had sworn by and suddenly was spiritually transformed realized that the story of the Jews of the story every man that when he read the book of Ruth or when he read the book of job or when he read about the tribulations of Abraham God was directly speaking to his soul and telling him that there were certain spiritual events which had an infinite significance far different from anything which they might appear on the set which might appear on the surface in this transformed religious condition he came back to koenigsberg and began to write he wrote obscurely Under many pseudonyms he wrote in a style which is proved from this day to there to unreadable at the same time he had a very powerful and marked influence upon a number of other writers who in that turn had a considerable influence upon European life he was admired by herder who said to transformed the writing of History and transformed to some degree also the whole attitude towards the Arts which prevails today he had an influence on Goethe who wish to edit his works and who regarded him as one of the most gifted and profound spirits of his time and supported him against all possible rivals he had an influence on kepter guard who lived after he died who said he was set in the profoundest writer he had ever read not intelligible even to him nevertheless although Europe securely it is possible by dint of extreme attention which I didn't really commend this particular audience to collect 13 grains of sense from the extraordinary contorted metaphors euphuistic stylisms allegories and other forms of dark political speech with which Harmons fragmentary writings never finished anything are written and the doctrine which he enunciated was approximately this he began with humor and he said in effect that humans right that if you ask yourself how it is that you know the universe you know the universe not by intellect but by faith if Hume said that he could not even break an egg he could not even drink a glass of water without an Act of Faith which could not be bolstered up by Logic how much more this was true of almost every other experience we had and of course Harman wished to say that his belief in God and in the creation were bolstered by precisely the same argument as hume's belief in his egg and his glass of water the French built in general propositions General propositions of the Sciences but the general proposition of the science is never caught the actual living palpitating reality of life if you met a man and wish to know what he was like the idea of clapping upon Him various psychological and sociological generalizations gleaned from The Works of montesuke or of gondiac would teach her nothing the only way in which we discovered what fuel beings were like was by speaking to them by communicating with them communication meant an actual meeting of two human beings and by watching the man's face and by watching the contortions of his body and his gestures by hearing his words and in many other ways which we could not outwards analyze you became convinced datum was presented to you knew to whom it was that you were talking communication was established the attempt to analyze this communication into scientific General propositions would of necessity failed General propositions were baskets of an extremely crude kind they were Concepts and categories which differentiated that which was common to a great many things common to many men of different thoughts common to many things of different sorts common to various ages what they left out of necessity because they were General was that which was unique that which was particular that which was the specific property of this particular man or this particular thing and that alone was of Interest too according to Hama if you wished to read a book you were not interested in what this book had in common with many other books if you looked at the picture you didn't wish to know what principles had gone to the making of this picture which had also gone to the making of a thousand other pictures and a thousand other ages by a thousand different painters you wish to react directly to the specific message if you like to the specific reality which looking at this picture reading this particular book speaking to this man praying to this God would in fact convey to you therefore he drew from this a kind of bugsonian conclusion namely that there was a flow of life that they attempt to cut this flow into segments in some sense killed it the Defiance is very well for their own purposes if you wished to discover about um how to grow plants and even then not always correctly if you wish to know about some kind of general principles about the general properties of bodies in general whether physical or chemical if you wish to know about what climates would assist what kind of growths to develop in them and so forth no doubt the science of it very well but this is not what men ultimately thought if you ask yourself what women after what did men really want what men wanted was not at all but volunteer I suppose they wanted Voltaire thought they wanted happiness Voltaire thought they wanted contentment Voltaire thought that they wanted peace but this was not true what men wanted was for all their faculties to play in the richest and most violent possible session what men wanted was to create what men wanted us to make and if this making led to clashes if it led to Wars if it led to struggles then this was part of the human lot a man who had been put in a voltarian garden paired and pruned as it were who had been brought up by some wise philosoph in knowledge of physics and the knowledge of chemistry and the knowledge of mathematics and the knowledge of all the Sciences which the encyclopedias had recommended such a man would in fact be a form of death in life The Sciences if they were applied to Human Society would lead to a kind of fearful bureaucratization he thought for him scientists bureaucrats persons who made things today every form smooth Lutheran clergyman deists everybody wanted to put things in boxes everybody who wished to assimilate one thing to another who wish to prove for example that creation was really the same as obtaining of certain data which nature provides and the rearrangement in certain pleasing patterns and whereas of course for harmony creation was the most ineffable Indescribable and analyzable personal act by which a human being in some way ladies stamp upon nature allowed his will to soar spoke his word utter death which was within him and which would not Brook any kind of um obstacle and therefore to him the whole of the Enlightenment Doctrine appeared to kill that it was living in human beings appeared to substitute for the creative energies of man and for the whole Rich world of the senses without which it is impossible for human beings to live to eat to drink to be many to meet other people to indulge in a thousand and one acts without which people with her and die that the enlightenment on the whole they no stress on that that the human being has painted by Enlightenment thinkers was an artificial kind of not economic man but even some kind of toy some kind of lifeless model which had no relation to the kind of human beings whom Haman met and wish to associate with every day in his life Gertrude says much the same thing about Mendelson he says Mendelson treats Beauty as entomologists feed butterflies he catches the poor animal and he pins it down and as its Exquisite colors drop off there it lies a lifeless Dead Cops under the pin this is Aesthetics this is a very typical reactions it's become a part of the youthful romantic gutier of the 1770s under the interest of Harman against the tendency on the part of the French to generalize to classify to pin down to a range in albums to try and produce some kind of rational ordering of Human Experience leaving out as is supposed to be the elavital the flow the individuality they create desires to create the desire even to struggle the death in human beings which produced between people of different views perhaps what might be called a creative Clash of opinion instead of that dead Harmony and peace which according to Harman and his followers the French were after that I think is how Haman began let me give you some typical quotations and you will see the kind of thing the Bliss of the human cells is Harman is not at all what voltas seems to think namely happiness the Bliss of the human soul is rooted in the untraveled realization of its powers as man is made in God's image serves the body the picture of the Soul this is quite interesting though the body is a picture of the Civil because when you meet a human being and you say what is he like you judge by his face you're judged by his body and the idea there is a soul and a body which can be dissected that there is spirit and flesh which are different that the body is one thing but there is something inside the man a kind of ghost palpitating inside this machine which is quite different from in fact what the man is in his totality in his Unity is a typical dissecting French View what is this reason with its universality infallibility overweedingness certainty self-evidence and it is a stuffed dummy which the howling Superstition of one reason has endowed with Divine attributes they are made you pause at the beginning of the 18th century said what one is felt and thought in in one language one expressed with equal Elegance in any other this two harmonious absolute Madness language is that with which we express ourselves there is no such thing as thought on the one-handed language on the other language is not a glove which could be put in our thought when we think we think in symbols we think in words and therefore all translation isn't principle impossible those who think think in particular symbols and these symbols are the ones which strike upon the senses and Imagination of the people whom we speak approximations maybe we're in other languages but if you really wish to enter into contact with a human being if you really wish to understand what they think what they feel what they are then you must understand every dress travel you must understand every Nuance you must watch their eyes you must observe the movement of their lips you must hear their words you must understand their handwriting and then you come to direct acquaintance with the actual sources of life anything less than that the attempt to translate his language into another language to classify all these various movements by some anatomical or physiogonomical means to try and put him into a box with a lot of other people and produce a learning volume which will as it was simply classify him as one of the species one of a type that is the way to miss all knowledge that is the way to kill that is the way to apply Concepts and categories Hollow baskets to the palpitating unique asymmetrical unclassifiable flesh of living human experience this is roughly speaking the doctrine of Haman and that is the doctrine which he bequeathed to his followers to abolish Caprice and fancy in the Arts he said is to be like an assassin plotting against the Arts life and honor passion that is what art possesses passion which cannot be described and cannot be classified that is what Moses Mendelssohn that aesthetic Moses Moses aesthetic law Giver he says wants to circumcise he wants to circumcise all these aesthetic Commandments Thou shalt not assail this Thou shalt not taste that in a free state he says where the leaves from the Divine book of the Divine Shakespeare blow about in all tempests of time in a free state how dare a man do this go to said about him in order to achieve the impossible he stretches his hand to all the elements all the demand undertakes must bring to his United Powers all separation is to be rejected I must I think stop at this point and my next lecture I propose to go on with the influence of Harmony upon the German Romantics and the Very variant impact which developer made upon the body of the French enlightened establishment [Applause] ladies and gentlemen last time I spoke to about the Obscure figure of Johann Georg Haman because I believe that he was the first person to declare war upon the enlightenment in the most open violent and complete fashion chronologically he said to the earliest to have done so to indicate that he was not entirely alone in this even in his own lifetime let me say this the 18th centuries everybody knows is the platitude whilst I suppose the age of the great Triumph of science certainly the great victories of science are the most phenomenal event of that particular period and certainly the profoundest evolution in human sentiment which had occurred occurred as a result of the destruction of Elder forms both the attack upon the established religion on the part of organized Natural Science and of the old medieval hierarchy by the new secular state at the same time there is no doubt that so far did the rationalism go that as always happens in such cases the human sentiment which is in some way blocked by rationalism of this type sought for some kind of egress in other directions when the Olympian gods become too tame and too rational and too normal people naturally enough begin to Incline towards Dhaka mocksonian deities this is certainly what happens in the third Century BC in Greece and what began happening in the 18th century there's no doubt that organized religion was in some sense on the retreat if you consider for example the kind of rational religion which is preached by the Disciples of liability in Germany where for example the great philosopher wolf who dominated German universities tried to reconcile religion with reason and anything which couldn't be reconciled with reason became unfashionable and that is why it is necessary somehow to save religion by proving his harmony with reason wolf tried to do this by saying for example that Miracles could be reconciled with a rational interpretation of the universe by supposing for example that when Joshua stopped the Sun at Jericho he was simply an astrophysicist with profounder knowledge that most of other astrophysicists of his time this degree this depths of penetration of astrophysical knowledge on his part was certainly miraculous that when Christ turned water into wine he simply understood chemistry in a manner profounder then that was any human being not assisted by divine inspiration could have understood given that this is the depth to which rationalism had fallen and that religion had to make this kind of compromise in order to get any opportunity of being received at all it is perhaps not very surprising that people should have turned Elsewhere for moral and spiritual satisfaction there is no doubt that while perhaps happiness and Order might be provided by the new scientific philosophy the irrational desires of men the whole realm of those unconscious drives of which the 20th century has made us so very acutely aware began to breed some kind of satisfactions of its own and so perhaps somewhat to the surprise of people who believed the 18th century to have been a harmonious symmetrical infant irrational elegant glasses sort of century a kind of peaceful mirror of human reason and human Beauty not disturbed by anything deeper or darker to the surprise of people who think that I think I'm bound to point out that never in the history of Europe had so many irrational persons wandered over the surface of Europe claiming adherence I mean to say that it is in the 18th century when we begin with the Masonic and the rosicrucian sects it is then that all kinds of charlatans and Wanderers begin to affect particularly the second half of the century the minds of all kinds of apparently sane and rational persons it is then that kaliostro appears in Paris and gets involved in higher circles it is then that mesmar begins talking about animal spirits this is the favored age of all kinds of necromancers and chiromancers and hydromancers who wander over Europe with their various nostrums engaging their attention and indeed capturing the faith of a great many otherwise apparently say in a rational business certainly the experiments in your Cult of the kings of Sweden and of Denmark of the Duchess of Devonshire the Cardinals is something which it would have been surprising in the 17th century and an unknown in the 19th this is the century therefore when these things begin to spread the word of course more respectable interesting manifestations of the same anti-rationalism for example a kind of young of his Day invented the science of what he called physiogenomonia he attempted to measure people's faces for the purpose of obtaining some kind of insight into the psychological character because of a belief in the unity and in the solubility of the spiritual and the physical aspects of men at the same time he didn't discourage all those much more dubious phrenologists and spiritualists of one kind or another all those strange Messiahs who wandered about occasionally accommitting crimes at other times merely causing to Perfection some of whom were arrested for their crimes other of whom were allowed to wonder about at large in the Wilder and more old-fashioned persons for example of the German Empires attenuate this is the atmosphere in which we move there's under the surface of this apparently coherent and apparently Elegance injury there are all kinds of dark forces moving and hamon of whom I spoke is merely the most political theologically the profoundest and in a sense the most interesting representative of this violent Revolt of what might be called quality against quantity of the whole anti-scientific yearnings and desires of men Hammond's fundamental Doctrine which I try to expound perhaps over history last time was this that God was not a geometer he was not a mathematician that he was a poet that there was something Blasphemous in attempting to Feist upon God our own purely human logical schemes that when said to him Hama being a friend of his that he thought of the science of astronomy had finally come to an end the astronomers knew all they could know and it was a satisfactory thing that this particular science could now be locked up as having been so to speak completed when it comes to deaths at Harman I felt like standing him as if there would be no more miracles in the universe as if any human endeavor could be regarded as over and done with finished the very notion that human beings were finite that there were certain subjects about which everything could be known that there was some portion of nature which could be fully investigated and some questions which could be ultimately answered to all this appeared to him to be shocking unreal and plainly stupid this I think it really is the heart of haman's Doctrine it is a kind of mystical vitalism which perceives in nature and in history the voice of God that the voice of God speaks to us through nature with an old mystical belief Harman added to this the further doctrine that history too speaks to us that all the various historical events were just simply taken to be ordinary empirical events by unenlightened historians are really methods whereby the Divine speaks to us each of these events possesses an occult on mystical significance which those eyes to see can perceive Hebrews among the earliest of those and when I say earliest of those I mean that he was later than weaker but then vika wasn't red that he was among the earliest of those who said that myths myths and symbols myths were not simply false statements about the world not either the wicked inventions of unscrupulous persons seeking to throw dust in people's eyes nor pretty embellishments invented by Poets for the purpose of in some way decorating their Wares myths were ways in which human beings expressed their sense of the ineffable and inexpensable Mysteries of Nature and there was no other way in which they could be expressed if words were used they didn't do that job properly words cut things to Pieces too much words classified words were too rational the attempt to tie things up to neat parcels and arrange them in some beautifully analytic fashion destroyed the unity the continuity and the Vitality of the subject matter that is to say life in the world which we were contemplating myths in some way conveyed this mystery in artistic images and artistic symbols which without words managed to connect man with the mysteries of nature this was roughly speaking the doctrine now the whole thing was of course immense protest against the French spread not only to Germany it was phenomenon of this kind of noticeable in England also where perhaps the most eloquent exponent of this point of view will come somewhat later in time than Harman is of course the mystical play with William Blake Blake's enemies the persons in Black regards as the villains of the whole modern period are lock and Newton them here to Gods as those devils who killed the Spirit by cutting reality into some kind of mathematically symmetrical pieces whereas reality is a living hurl which can only be appreciated in some non-mathematical fashion let me give you typical quotations from breaking AdSense which will convey this too he was a typical sweating Bogan and the swedenborg's disciples were very typical of the kind of occult Subterranean movements in the 18th century which I referred to what Blake like all Mystics of his type desired was some kind of recovery of control over to speak the spiritual element which in some way became petrified as a result of human degeneration and the wicked work of unimaginative killers of the human Spirit like mathematicians and scientists he says laws are needed to fence menoff and their children wept and built tombs in desert places and formed laws of prudence and and called them the Eternal laws of God this is directed against what might be called rationalists of the 18th century and the whole notion of symmetrically arranged order founded upon non-mystical empirical or logical reasoning when he writes in those famous lines that everyone knows robin redbreast in a cage puts all heaven in a rage the cage of which he speaks is The Enlightenment and that is the cage in which he and persons like him appear to suffocate all their lives in the second half of the 18th century children of a future age reading this indignant page know that in a former time love sweet love was thought a crime love to him was identical with art Jesus he calls an artist his disciples he also calls artists art is the tree of life science is the tree of death Liberate the spark that is the great Cry of all persons who feel somehow strangled and suffocated by the new Thai day scientific order which doesn't respond to the deeper problems which educate the human soul the Germans tended on the whole to suppose that in France nobody was aware nobody began to be aware of what these deeper problems were that all the French Were Somehow desiccated monkeys with no conception of what it was that moved human beings human beings as possessors of souls as possessors of some kind of spiritual needs this was not entirely true if for example you go to such a representative think of the Enlightenment as even deadro upon whom I suppose the Germans looked as one of the the Germans before I speak looked as one of the most noxious representatives of the new materialism the new science the new destruction of all that was spiritual religious in life if you go to someone like that in him you will find something which is not all that unlike the particular attitude even among the Germans which I have described is perfectly aware that research thing as the irrational element in man and there are unconscious depths in which all kinds of dark Forces move and he is aware the human genius feeds upon these and that the forces of light are not by themselves enough to create these Divine works of art which he himself admires he speaks of art very often in terms of great passion and says that there is about the great genius it is about the great artist something which is the 70th Century expression which enables him to imagine these works of art with a degree of sweep with the magnificence of depths of insight and with a degree of intellectual Courage the taking on the huge intellectual risks which makes Men of Genius and artists of this type akin to Great criminals and there is a passage in the draw where he speculates upon The Nearness to criminals of artists because they both defy rules there are both persons who are in some way in love with power magnificence and Splendor and kick over the traces of normal life normal existence and the whole tame existence of over civilized man did wrong is among the first to preach there are two men there is the artificial man who belongs in society and conforms to the practices of society and seeks to please and is artificial the sort of normal artificial mincing little figure of the caricaturists of the 18th century within this man however there is imprisoned a violent bold dark criminal Instinct of a man who wishes to break out and this is the man who is properly controlled is perhaps responsible for the Magnificent works of Genius which are created Genius of this type Can't Be Tamed Genius of this type has nothing to do with those rules which the Abe butter or the Abe dubas laid down as being the rational conventions the rational rules in accordance with which alone would work the Mark will be produced let me read you a typical passage this is comes from the salon of 1765 that is to say one of those early art criticisms justly famous beware of those whose pockets are full of Esprit and to scatter this weight at every opportunity everywhere they have no demon within them they are not gloomy or somber or Melancholy or silent they are never either awkward or foolish the Lark the challenge the linit the canary they trap and Twitter all the live long day at Sunset they fill their head under their wing and no not asleep it is then the genius takes his lamp and lights it and this dark solitary Savage bird this untamable creature with its gloomy Melancholy pyramid opens its throat and begins its song makes the Groves ReSound and breaks the silence and the Darkness of the night this is an appearance to genius as in contrast with talent in contrast with rules in contrast with the so-called wanted virtues of the 18th century sanity rationality measure proportion and overestimate which shows that even in this terrible designated City of Paris where according to the Germans nobody has ever lived nobody has ever seen the color nobody has ever known what abstaining of a human cell is nobody has any notion of what the agonies of the spirit are what God is or what Transfiguration of man may be in this city town there were persons who were aware of what might be called self-transcendence of irrational forces of something which undoubtedly was somewhat of the same type as that which but of course and at this point somebody will again say what about Rousseau well what indeed about Rousseau it would be foolish to deny the Rousseau was one of the great factors The Roosters words were among the factors influenced Romantic Movement nevertheless again I have to repeat his role has been exaggerated if you consider what it is the Russo actually said as opposed to the manner in which he said it and I think the manner of the life is more important if you ask yourself what Rusev said what he said is the purest milk of the rationalist word all through Services we live in a corrupt Society we live in a bad hypocritical Society where men lie to each other and murder each other and are false for each other that it is possible to discover the truth that this truth is to be discovered not by means of sophistication or Cartesian logic but by looking within the heart of the simple uncorrupt human being the noble savage or the child or whoever it may be that once this truth is discovered it is an eternal truth true for all men everywhere in all climes and seasons and when we have discovered this truth then it is important that we should live in accordance with it this is not different from what the Hebrew prophets have said on every Christian preacher who has ever preached against the corrupt sophistication of the big cities and the falling away from God which goes on in such places Russo's actual Doctrine is not very different from that of the encyclopedists he disliked the person because temperamentally he was a kind of dervish from the desert he was paranoic Savage and gloomy in some respects and high net neurotic as we should today say and therefore hidden much in common with the people at halbach rather irrevering table or at the elegant receptions which Voltaire held at Verne but this was to a certain degree epistle or emotional matter the actual substance of what Rousseau said was not so very different from the official enlightened doctrine of the 18th century what was different was the manner and what was different was the temperament when Russell begins describing his own particular state of mind and states of Soul when he begins describing the emotions which tear him apart the violent characterisms of Rage or Joy through which he goes then of course he does use a tone which is very different from that of the 18th century but this is not the doctrine of Rousseau which was inherited by the Jacobins or which in various forms entered into the doctrines of the 19th century let me read you the kind of passage of Rousseau which doesn't entitle him to be regarded as one of the fathers of Romanticism I didn't reason I didn't philosophize reddish I surrendered to the confusion of these great ideas I suffocated in the universe I wanted to LEAP into the infinite my spirit gave itself to swelling ecstasy that of course is a passage which is not very similar to the sobra or Cena passages of the encyclopedists that wouldn't have been cared for by Elvis or by Voltaire or even Rooster's point was that nobody could love as David Russo loved nobody could hate and threw so hate it nobody could suffer as Rusev suffered and only Rousseau could understand Russo it was unique nobody else could understand him but only a genius could understand another genius this was illness in a certain sense a Doctrine opposed to the view that the truth was equally open to all reasonable men who did not becloud their understandings with unnecessary emotions and with unnecessary ignorance does is to contrast with the so-called cooled logic which he comes to the complains about cold reason he contrasts with that the hot tears of shame or DOI or misery or love or despair or mortification or spiritual Agony or ecstatic vision and that is why Harman called him the best of the sophists but still a sophist still a sophist Harman was Socrates and Russo was a sophist he was the best because he gave signs of understanding that it wasn't quite right with this elegant and rational and say in Paris but still even suffix because his doctrines still appeal to reason they still appeal to the fact that there was some kind of establishment some kind of good kind of human life with good kind of Men If Only They would scrape off all the falsehood which would manage to accumulate upon them through the centuries if only they could remove the bad society which had corrupted them if only they could manage to do that then they could live well forever in accordance with Timeless precepts that is precisely what the Germans disbelieved and precisely what they rightly accused Rousseau in believing the only difference was that the other encyclopedists in Paris believed this could be done by reform they believed this could be done by gradually they believe this might be done by somehow converting converting the rulers to their point of view getting hold of an enlightened despot and if he was enlightened enough he could establish some kind of better life on Earth Russell believed that the whole test superstructure must be raised to the ground the entire Wicked Human Society must be burnt to ashes and then a new Phoenix would arise constructed by him and by his disciples but in principle what they wished to do was the same although perhaps their view of the methods may have differed now if you compare this this kind of talk with what the Germans were saying at the same time you will see that the German attitude towards all this is far more violent let me read you a typical passage from the third length who did it in fact commit suicide who was a contemporary of Rusev roughly speaking and says the following action action is the soul of the world not Theresa not abandonment to feeling not abandonment to reasoning only action only by action does not become the image of God the God who creates ceaselessly and ceaselessly rejoices in his Works without action all pleasure are all feeling all knowledge is nothing but a postponed death we must not cease from toil until we have created free space even if this space is a fearful waste and a fearful void and then we shall brood over it as God brooded over the waste and the void before the world was created and then something will arise oh Bliss oh Godlike feeling this is something a very different order from even the most violent fluctuations from the most ecstatic exclamations Russo and indicates a very different attitude this sudden passion for Action as such and hatred of any established order hatred of any kind of view of the universe as having a structure which calm or even uncomm perception is able to understand contemplate classify describe and finally use this I think is unique to the Germans again if you ask for the causes of this I didn't go back to what I was saying last time namely that it was largely due I think two as it were both the intense spirituality of pietism from amongst whom these people spring on the one hand and on the other hand to the ravages of science which undermined the apparatistic faith and while leaving them with a temperament of pietists had removed the religious certainties of that movement but if we look at the plays and the fourth and fifth and sixth straight plays which the so-called storm and stress movement in Germany produced in the 60s and 70s you will now find a very different tone from that prevailing anywhere else in European literature if you look for example at Klinger's play klinga was a was a German playwright who wrote the play called storm drunk storm and stress after whom the movement is called there's a playback called the twins in which one of the twins the more powerful imaginative and fiery the Romantic kills his weak previous and disagreeable brother because he says because his brother won't let him develop his nature in accordance with his demonic or Titanic demands now in all previous tragedy the Assumption was that in some other Society there will be no need for these Dreadful things to occur Society is bad therefore it must be improved men are done down by Society well then one must be able to imagine a better society as Rousseau was able to imagine it in which people do not suffocate in which people do not fight in which the bed are not at the top and the good at the bottom in which parents do not torture their children in which women are not married off to men they do not love it must be possible to construct a better world not so in King of tragedy not so in Julius fontarent a terrible Elizabeth I don't wish to recite before you these justly forgotten names but broadly speaking the substance of all these plays is that there is some kind of insoluble conflict in the world in nature Itself by which the strong cannot live the weak the Lions cannot live with the Lambs the strong must-have room we wish to breathe and the weak go to the wall if they do it and the weak will suffer and will naturally resist and it is right the weak should resist and it is right to the strong suppress them and therefore conflict collusion tragedy if all kinds of Horrors which go on uh in some way inevitably involved in the nature of the universe and the view is therefore fatalistic and pessimistic not scientific and optimistic not even spiritual and optimistic in any sense of the word foreign this has a kind of natural Affinity to Harmon's view that God is closer to the abnormal than he is to the normal which he in fact he openly says the normal don't really understand what goes on you see it's a sort of original perhaps moment at which the whole what might be called Dostoyevsky complex comes into existence in which God is it's in a certain sense of course the application of Christianity but a rather new one because so sincere and so deeply intended in which God is closer to the thieves and the prostitutes the Sinners and Republicans then he is Haman says to the smooth philosophers of Paris or the smooth clergymen in Berlin who are trying to reconcile religion with reason which is degradational humiliation of everything that man cares for all the great Masters who excelled in human Endeavors is Harman where sick men in one way or another have wounds Hercules Ajax Socrates and Paul so long the Hebrew prophets bakantis demonic figures none of these were men of good sense and that I think neither the hearts that speak of the whole of this vile and doctrine of personal self-assertion which is really the heart of the German storm and stress however all these persons are competitive minor figures I merely wish to bring them out in order to show you that Haman who I think just does deserve to be rescued in the darkness of Oblivion wasn't entirely alone the only worthwhile the only valuable work with the stormy drunk produced I suppose was yesterday which was a typical expression of it also there too there is no future there is no situation in which verter can avoid suicide there is no situation in which verta being in love with the married lady and the marriage vow being what it is and believed by verta and by the ourselves to be what it is there is no way in which this problem could be solved if one man's love and another man's love come into Collision it is a hopeless and hopeless business and must embed you that is the model of the after and that is why young men up and down Germany were said to have committed suicide in its name not because in the 18th century or in that particular society there was no adequate solution as because they despaired in the world and thought it irrational place in which a solution was in principle undiscoverable this then is the atmosphere sipstick which developed in Germany in the 1760s and 1770s but there were two men who were I think the true fathers of Romanticism who were certainly a first a size that any of the people I have mentioned to the two as being responsible for it and about whom I mistakes speak they both emerge from this movement one in some sense sympathetic to it the other acutely hostile to it but by his work a greater advancer of its ideals as ironically sometimes happens the first is herder the second is and on them I must stop a little I don't wish to expound to the general ideas and the new Notions for which held as responsible and by which he transformed for example are Notions of History our National Society the vast influence which is extraordinating ahead he was also of course a pietist and a person and like the others revolted against the  and span Empire of Frederick the great it was really this Pi Day enlightened despotism and it was enlightened managed by French intellectuals and French officials under the leadership of this extremely clear-headed and extremely energetic and extremely powerful despot that really caused these good men to suffocate even country who was by nature of somewhat irascible and somewhat unbalanced temperate the doctrines of heard that about which I wish to speak are these there are three doctrines in particular which contributed to the Romantic Movement very powerfully and which arrived quite naturally out of the million of which I've spoken one is the notion of what I should like to call expressionism the other is the notion of belonging what it means to belong to a group and the third is the notion that ideals true ideas are often incompatible with one another and cannot be reconciled these three ideas each had a revolutionary significance in their day and they are worth lingering over a little because they are commonly not done Justice to even in primaries of the history of thought the first notion of expression of expressivism is this herder believed that one of the fundamental functions of human beings was to express to speak and therefore that whatever a man did expressed his full nature and if it didn't Express his full nature it's because he named himself or restrained himself or in some way laid some kind of leash upon his energies and this he learned of course from his master Harman he really was a direct and faithful disciple of this strange figure Harman who was called Norton the magos in the north Migos meaning one of the three major in that sense of Lagos now normally speaking if we take for example the Aesthetics of the 18th century even though they just speak much more passionate Aesthetics or something like we draw than the dry and conventional Aesthetics of the Abe but if we're taking Statics in 18th century broadly speaking the value of a work of art would be said to consist in it being what it was namely the value of a picture was that it was beautiful what made it beautiful one could argue about whether it was because it gave pleasure whether it's because it satisfied the intellect whether it was because it had some peculiar relation to the harmonies of the Spheres or of the universe and was in some way um a copy of some great platonic original to which the artist and a member of inspiration had access about that you might disagree what everyone agreed about was that the value of a work of art consisted in the properties which it had being what it is beautiful symmetrical shaped whatever it might be a silver bull was beautiful because it was a beautiful build because it had the properties of being beautiful however that was defined this had nothing to do with who made it and it had nothing to do with why it was made the artist took very much the position of a purveyor who said my private life is no business of the man who buys the work of art you have asked for a silver bull here it is I provide it it is no business of yours whether I am a good husband or a good voter or a nice man or believing God you have asked for a table here is a table if it is a solid Sound Table such as you need What complaints can you have you have asked for a painting with us for a portrait if it is a good portrait take it I am Mozart I am Haydn I hope to produce a beautiful musical composition by which I mean one which will be recognized as beautiful by others and for which I should be paid an adequate commission and which will perhaps make my name as an immortal artist that is the normal 18th century View and it is the view of a great many people indeed probably the majority since this was not the view which the Germans before I speak took particularly not Harmon and certainly not health a work of art is the expression of somebody it's always a voice speaking a work of art is the voice of one man addressing himself to other men and whether it be a silver bill or a musical composition or a poem or even a code of laws whatever it may be any artifact of human hands is in some way the expression of the attitude to life conscious or unconscious of its maker when we appreciate work of art we are put in some kind of contact with a man who made it and in some sense it speaks to us that is certainly the doctrine that is why the idea that an artist should say as an artist I do this and as a vet or husband I do that the very notion that a man can in some way chop himself up into compartments and say that with one hand I do one thing and this has nothing to do with what my other hand is doing that my private convictions have nothing to do with the speeches which I put into the mouths of the characters in My Tragedy that I am simply a purveyor that what must be judged is the work of art and not the maker the biography the psychology the purposes the whole substance so to speak of the artist is irrelevant to the work of art that Doctrine was rejected with violence by herder and by those who followed him who said if take for example folk song If a folk song speaks to you it is because the people who have made it were Germans like yourself and they spoke to you who belong with them in the same society and because they were Germans they used particular nuances they use particular successions of sounds they use particular words which being in some way connected with swimming in the great tide of words and symbols and experience upon which all Germans swim has something peculiar to say to certain persons which it cannot say to certain other persons the Portuguese cannot understand the inwardness of a German song is a German can and the German cannot understand the inwardness of a Portuguese song and the Very fact that the research thing is inwardness at all in these songs is an argument for supposing that these are not simply objects like objects in nature which don't speak there were they are in some sense artifacts that's to say something which a man has made for the purpose of communicating with another man this is a doctrine of art as expression or the doctrine of art as communication and then of course have that goes on from this to develop the thesis in the most poetical and imaginative manner and he says some things are made by individuals and other things are made by groups some things are made consciously and other things are made unconsciously if you ask who has made focus on who has made folk dancing who has made the German laws who has made the German models who has made the institutions under which we live you cannot give the answer this lies shrouded in the mist's impersonal Antiquity nevertheless men have made it the world is what men have made of it our world our German world is constructed by other Germans and that is why it smells and feels and looks and sounds to us as it does and from this he developed the notion that every man seeks to belong to some kind of group or in fact does belong to it and if taken out of it will feel alien and not at home the whole notion of being at home or being cut off from one's natural Roots the whole idea of roots the whole idea of belonging to a group a sect a movement was invented largely by her there are anticipations of this in The Marvelous markovico that I have today again the works of vehicle have been forgotten and although here they might have seen it in the late 70s he developed Mysteries ideas before any date at which apparently he had seen the work of his great Italian predecessor he had a fundamental conviction was something of this order that every man who wishes to express himself uses words are not his invention they are specific already inherited by him in some kind of inherited stream of traditional images this stream itself has been fed by other men expressing themselves a man who has been has more in common of an impulsable kind with other men with whom Nature has faced him in some proximity than he has with men removed from him herder doesn't use the criteria of blood and he doesn't use the criteria of race he talks about Nation but nazion in the 18th century didn't have the connotation of nation in the 19th he speaks of language as a bond and he speaks of soil as a bond and the thesis roughly speaking is that that which people who belong to the same group have in common is more directly responsible for that being as they are than that which they have in common with others in other places do it the way in which let us say a German Rises and sits down the way in which he dances the way in which he legislates his handwriting and his poetry and his music and the way in which it Combs his hair and the way in which he philosophizes all have some impulpable common Gestalt all have some pattern quality in virtue of which they are recognizably German birthed by him and by others wherein they differ from similar acts on the part of the Chinese the Chinese also come their hair they also write poetry they also have laws they also hunt and obtain their food in various ways and make their clothing and there is something common response to the way in which all men react to similar natural stimuli nevertheless there is a peculiar Gestalt quality which qualifies certain human groups not nationalities Perhaps Perhaps these groups are smaller herder was certainly not a nationalist in the sense of believing so to speak there was some kind of deep impalable Essence to do certainly with the blood or race all he believes it was that human groups grew in some plant-like or some animal like fashion and that organic Botanical and other biological metaphors were more suitable for describing such growth than where the chemical and mathematical metaphors of the French 18th century popularizers of science now from this certain romantic conclusions certainly do follow that's the second reason which affected anti-rationalism as at least it was understood in the 18th century and that is this that if indeed this is so then it clearly follows that objects can't be described without reference to the purposes of their makers the value of a work of art has to be somehow analyzed in terms of the particular group of cousins to whom it is addressed the motive of him who speaks the effect upon those who are spoken to and the bond which it automatically creates between the speak up and the spoken tool it is a form of communication and if it is a form of communication then it hasn't got what might be called an impersonal or Eternal value if you wish to understand a work of art for example made by some ancient Greek it is certainly no use laying down Timeless criteria in terms of it all works and what must be beautiful and then considering whether the Greek work of art is bootful or not in terms of these criteria unless you understand what the Greeks were what they wanted how they lived unless as 300 says in the most uncanny way has helped ourselves most enormous difficulty with the greatest possible effort of the imagination unless you enter into the feelings of these remote exceeding the strange peoples who are remote from you in time and place unless you try by some active imagination to reconstruct within yourself for the form of life which these people did what they wanted how they lived what their laws were what that ethical principles were what the streets look like what the various values were unless you try in other words to live yourself into that form of Life all this is commonplace now but was not commonplace in the 1760s and 70s when it was first spoken unless you try and do that your chances of truly understanding that art and truly understanding their writings and really knowing what Plato meant and really knowing who Socrates was are small Socrates for him is not the Timeless stage of the French Enlightenment time resolution simply the ironical deflator of pompous no oils which is what Harman conceived him to be Socrates is a 5th Century Athenian who lived in fifth century Athens not in the fourth Century not in the second not in Germany not in France but in Greece then and only then and in order to understand the Greek philosophy you must understand Greek art in order to understand Greek art you must understand the Greek history in order to understand Greek history you must understand Greek geography you must see the plants which they saw you must understand the soil on which they lived and so on and so on and this stuff becomes the beginning of the whole notion of historicism evolutionism the very notion that you can only understand other human beings in terms of an environment very dissimilar to your own and this is also the root of and this is what the notion of belonging is the notion of what it is to belong to somebody was really elucidated for the first time by hand and that is why the whole notion of Cosmopolitan man a man who's equal at home in Paris at Copenhagen or Iceland or India is to him repentant a man belongs to where he is people have Roots they can only create in terms of those symbols in which they were brought up and they were brought up in terms of some kind of close society which spoke to them in uniquely intelligible version any man who hasn't had a good fortune to suffer this any man was brought up without fruits on a desert island by himself an exile an immigraine is to that extent weakened and his creative powers are automatically made the smaller this was not a Doctrine which could have been understood but certainly which could not have been approved of by the rationalist Universalist objectivist Cosmopolitan thinkers of the French 18th century that was the first point but a far more starting conclusion uh very followers from this which heard that didn't perhaps himself altogether stress and that was this if the value of every culture resides in What that particular culture seeks after as he says every culture has its own center of gravity and you must determine what the center of gravity was he calls it what the center of gravity is before you can even understand what these men were about certainly is no use judging these things the point of view of some other Century or some other culture if you have to do that then you will grasp the fact that different ages had different ideals and these ideas were each in its way valid for those times in those places and can be admired and can be appreciated by us now but now I in my very first lecture I try to lay down the proposition that one of the great axioms of the 18th century Enlightenment which is what Romanticism came to destroy was that there could be valid objective answers could be discovered to all the great questions which educate mankind how to live what to be what is good what is bad what is right what is wrong what is beautiful what is ugly why it does and these answers can be obtained by some special method recommended by the particular thinker in question and that all these answers can be stated in the form of propositions and all these propositions if they are true will be compatible with one another perhaps even more than compatible perhaps there will even entail one another and taken together these propositions will as it were constitute that ideal State of Affairs that perfect State of Affairs which for One Reason Not Another we all would like to see happen whether or not it is actually a practical or feasible now if harder is right if 5th Century Greeks could only go for an ideal quite different from that to Babylonians if the Egyptian view of life because these people lived in Egypt which had a different geography and a different climate and different types of factors and because the Egyptians were descended from people with a completely different ideology from the Greeks if what the Egyptians wanted was different what the Greeks wanted but equally valid equally fruitful all these things are true and the Hamner is one of those not very many thinkers in the world who really do absolutely adore things for being what they are and don't condemn them for not being something else they for her that everything is delightful he's delighted by Babylon and he's delighted by Syria he's delighted by India and he's delighted by Egypt he thinks well of the Greeks he thinks well of the Middle Ages he thinks well of the 18th century he thinks well of almost everything except the immediate environment of his own time and place but even if not that he does he destroyed by another he doesn't like Julius Caesar because Julius is not trampled on a lot of Asiatic cultures and we shall now not know what the cappadocians were really after he doesn't raise Crusades because the Crusades damaged the byzantines or they damaged the Arabs and these cultures had every right to the richest and fullest of expression without the trampling feat of a lot of imperialist knights he dislikes every form of violence coercion and the swallowing of one Culture by another because he wants everything to be as much of what it is as it can possibly be Heather is really the originator and the author if you like not of nationalism as he sometimes said although no doubt some of these ideas internationalism but much more I don't quite know what give name to give it to something like populism that is to say if you like you know it's more comical forms he's really the originator of all those antiquarians who want natives to remain as native as possible who like arts and crafts or the test standardization everyone who likes the quaint people who wish to preserve the most Exquisite forms of old provincialism without impingement upon it of some hideous Metropolitan uniformity the health that is really the father and the ancestor of all these travelers all those amateurs who go around the world editing out all kinds of Forgotten forms of life delighted in everything that is peculiar everything that is odd everything that is native everything is untouched in that sense of course he did feed the streams of human sentimentality to a very high degree but that is anyhow I have this temperament and that is why since he wants everything to be as much of what it can be as it can be that's the develop itself to its richest fullest extent the notion that there can be one single ideal for all men everywhere becomes unintelligible if the Greeks had an ideal which was perfect for them as Greeks and if the Romans had an idea which was less perfect but as much as could be done for people who were unfortunately Romans or obviously less gifted than the Greeks at least Meredith's point of view if the Middle Ages produced magnificent works early with lasers in the form say of the song of the knee belongs which imagine mad or the other early ethics which he regarded as the simple heroic expressions of uncontaminated fresh peoples still wandering in the Woods uncrushed by some fearful jealous neighbors who trample upon their culture in a brutal way if all this is true we can't have all these things together what is the ideal form of life we can't be both Greek and Phoenician and medieval and eastern and western and northern and southern we can't attain the highest ideals of all the centuries in all the places at once since we can't do that the whole notion of the perfect life the whole notion of there being a human ideal which it is the business of all men to strive after that there is some kind of answer to these questions even if there is an answer in chemistry or if there is an answer in physics or as there is an answer in mathematics to certain questions to which in principle at least some kind of final answer can be given or if not final answer at any rate announcer which approximates the finality which is more final than any we've obtained yet with a hope or at least a direction that the further we proceed in the same direction the nearer to the final solution we come if this is true physics end of chemistry and the mathematics and as the 18th century thought should be true of ethics of politics of Aesthetics if it is possible to lay down criteria which tell you what makes a perfect work of art what makes a perfect life what makes a perfect character what makes a perfect political Constitution if it is possible to give these answers this this answer can only be obtained by so to speak supposing that all other answers however interesting however fascinating are false but if herder is right and it was right for the Greeks to proceed in the Greek Direction and it was right for the Indians to proceed in Indian Direction and The Greek ideal and the Indian ideal are totally incompatible which he not very confessed but emphasized with a kind of joy if variety and difference are not merely affected by the world but a splendid effect which is what he thought it to be and Arguments for the variety of the imagination of the Creator and the Splendor of human creative powers and the infinite possibilities still perform Mankind and the unfulfillability of human Ambitions and the general excitement of living in a world in which nothing can ever be fully exalted if that is the image then the notion of final answer to the question how to live becomes absolutely meaningless it could mean nothing at all because all these answers are presumably incompatible with one another hence here are those final conclusion namely that each group each human group must strive after that which somehow lies in its bones which is part of its tradition each each man belongs to group he belongs to his business as a human being is to speak speak the truth as it appears to him the truth it appears to him is as valid as the truth as it appears to others from this vast variety of colors a wonderful Mosaic can be made but nobody can see the homozaic nobody can see all the trees only God can see the entire universe men because they belong where they belong and Arbor they are and live where they do cannot but each age has its own internal ideal and therefore any form of nostalgic seeking after the past for example why cannot be we like the Greeks why can't we be like a Romans which is presumably what French political philosophers or French painters or French sculptors were saying to themselves the 18th century the whole notion of Revival the whole notion of going back to Middle Ages back to Roman virtues back to Sparta back to Athens or alternatively any form of cosmopolitanism why cannot we create this world state of such a kind that everybody in it will fit smoothly like ideal bricks who will form a structure which will go on forever and ever because it is constructed upon an indestructible formula which is the truth obtained by in insoluble methods all this must become nonsense meaningless self-conflictory and by uttering this by issuing this particular allowing this particular Doctrine to emerge herder dead plunge a most terrible dagger into the body of European nationalism from which it never recovered and in this sense he is certainly one of the fathers of the Romantic Movement to which I've not yet come that is to say he is one of the fathers of the movement one of the attributes the characteristics of which is the denial of unity the denial of Harmony the denial of the compatibility of ideals whether in the sphere of action or in the sphere of thought and length is a poster which I read to about action action always action make room for Action we can only live in action otherwise nothing is worth having that is very sympathetic to hear this whole point of view because for him life consists in expressing experience as it comes communicating it to others with a whole of your undivided personality as for what men will make within 200 years time 500 years time two thousand years time it doesn't matter he doesn't care he doesn't see why you should care and this I think is a very new and extremely revolutionary and very upsetting note in what had for the last two thousand years been the solid philosophia perennis of the West According to which all questions have true answers all true answers are in principle discoverable and all the answers are in principle compatible or combinable into one harmonious Hill like a jigsaw puzzle if what held us it was true this is false and upon this people then proceeded to argue and to struggle both in practice and in theory both in the course of the national revolutionary Wars and in the course of vile conflict of doctrines and of practice both in the Arts and in thought for the next 170 years next time I propose to talk to you about Kant about whom I fear I didn't have time to talk today and Schiller and by this time really to enter into the heart of Romanticism thank you very much [Applause] today speak about three German thinkers two philosophers and one artist one dramatist who left a very profound imprint upon the entire Romantic Movement both in Germany and Beyond its borders The Romantics of whom I speak today could I think just to be called restrained Romantics next time I propose to talk about unrestrained Romantics to whom this movement ultimately LED the nature of things said Luther once the nature of things does not Madness only ill will does this is probably true of the majority of mankind but there were certain Germans in the 18th century of whom this is plainly false they were imagined not merely by the ill will of persons but by the nature of things one of these certainly was a philosophy manual cut let me try and explain what it is that I wish to say hated romanticism he detested every form of extravagance fantasy what he calls vermeerai any form of generation mysticism vagueness confusion nevertheless he was just a regarded as one of the father of Romanticism in which there is a certain irony he was brought up like Haman and like Hearth whom he knew in a pirate's atmosphere he regarded Haman as a pathetic and Confused Mystic and he disliked heard those writings for the vast generalizations unsupported by evidence enormous great imaginative sweeps which he regarded on the whole as an offense against reason was it admire of the Sciences he had a precise and extremely Lucid mind he wrote obscurely but seldom imprecisely he was a distinguished scientist himself he was a distinguished cosmologist he believed in scientific principles perhaps more deeply than in any others he regarded as his life's task to explain the foundations of scientific logic and scientific method he disliked everything that was rap Surgical or confused in any respect he liked logic and he liked rigor he on the whole regarded those who objected to these qualities as simply mentally indolent he said that logic and regard were difficult exercises of the human mind and it was customary to those who found these things too difficult invented objections of a different type and no doubt there is a great deal in what he said but the respect in which he is the father of Romanticism is not as the critic of the Sciences nor of course as a scientist himself but specifically in his moral philosophy  was virtually Intoxicated by the idea of human freedom his prices are bringing LED not to rep surgical self-communings as he did in the case of the harman and others but a kind of intense preoccupation within our life of man with a moral life of man and one of the propositions about which he was convinced was that every man as such is aware of the difference between on the one hand inclination desires passions would pull at him as it were from outside which a part of his emotional or sensitive or in some sense empirical nature on the one hand and on the other the notion of Duty of obligation of what is Right which often came into conflict with desire for pleasure and for inclination and the confusion of the two appeared to him to be a primitive Pharisee um he might well have quoted the famous lines of shaftesbury who objected to the view of man as being determined or conditioned by outside factors man the draftsbury the beginning of the 18th century is not a tiger strongly trained or a monkey under the influence of a whip that is to say a tiger strongly trained to the fear of punishment or a monkey under the influence of the whip the Whip being desire for reward or fear of punishment man is free man has original native Liberty and this original native Liberty according to shaftesbury gives us the privilege of ourselves and makes us our own but this into the case of shaft spray for simply an Orbiter dictum which hadn't very much to do with the rest of his philosophy in the case of it became an obsessive Central principle man is man for only because he chooses the difference between man and the rest of nature with an animal or inanimate or vegetable is that other things are under the law of causality other things follow rigorously in some kind of for ordained schema of cause and effect whereas man is free to choose what he was treats this the will is the thing which distinguishes human beings from other objects in nature the will is that which enables men to choose either good or evil either right or wrong there is no merit in choosing what is Right unless it is possible to choose what is wrong creatures who are determined by whatever causes into perpetually choosing that which is good and beautiful and true could claim no merit for doing so for however Noble results the action would be automatic and therefore he supposed that the whole notion of moral made it the whole notion of moral desert the whole notion which is entailed in the fact that we praise and we blame that we consider the human beings are to be congratulated or condemned for acting in this or that way presupposes the fact that they are able freely to choose for this reason of course one of the things which he missed strenuously disliked was in politics at any rate the notion of paternalism there are two main obstacles which obsess Kant all his life one is the obstruction of men the other is the obstruction of things the obstruction of men is a familiar enough theme in a short essay called what is Enlightenment can't lays it down the enlightenment is simply the ability of men to determine their own lives The Liberation of themselves from the leading strings of others the fact that men become mature and determine what to do whether it be evil or whether it be good without leaning excessively upon Authority upon governesses of one kind or another upon the state upon their parents upon their nurses upon tradition upon any kind of established values upon which the weight of moral responsibility is then squarely laid a man is responsible for his own acts once he gives this up or if he's too immature to realize it then he is protenter a barbarian but not civilized a barbarian or a child civilization is maturity maturity is self-determination being determined by rational considerations and not being pushed and pulled about by something or other over which he has no control in particular by other persons a paternalist government has come and he thinks about Frederick the Great although it would no doubt it be unsafe for a professor in kurdicksburg to say so openly a pretender is government based on the benevolence of Aruna who treats his subjects as ungrown-up children is the greatest conceivable despotism and destroys all freedom and this is really an echo of Rousseau who said the man who stands Independence on another is no longer a man at all he has lost his standing he's nothing but the possession of another man and therefore can't in his moral philosophy is particularly rabid against any form of Domination by one human being against another he's very the father of the notion of exploitation as an evil thing I don't think you will find a very great deal before the late 18th century and in particular before  about exploitation as an evil and indeed why should it be regarded as so terrible that one man should use another man for his own purposes rather than this other man's perhaps there are worse vices perhaps cruelty is worse perhaps as the enlightenment maintained ignorance is worse or hindrance or other things of that sort not self account any kind of use of other people for purposes which are not these other peoples but one's own seems to him to be a form of degradation degradation imposed by one man or another seems to him some kind of form of hideous naming of other people of removal from them of that which distinguishes them as as men namely the self-determining Liberty and that is why you get these passionate sermons against exploitation degradation dehumanization and cut which afterwards becomes in some sense the stock and trade of all liberal and socialist writers in the 19th and 20th centuries the whole notion of degradation reification mechanization of Life the alienation of human beings from one another or from that proper purposes the use of many things the use of human beings is raw material for people to wreak their will on the general view of human beings as entities which can be pushed about or determined or educated against their will the monstrosity of that they speak the notion that this is in some sense the morally worst thing which one human being can do to another really stems from this passionate propaganda by cut no doubt it can be found in other authors particularly Christian authors before but it was he who secularized it and translated it into common European currency this is a very Central notion indeed why did he feel this he felt this of course because he thought the values were entities which human beings in some sense generated themselves the notion is this if human beings depend on something outside themselves for their actions if in other words the source of their behavior is not within them but in something else then they cannot be regarded as responsible if they are not responsible they are not moral beings if they are not moral beings then our distinctions of right and wrong our distinctions are free and unfree our distinctions of Duty and pleasure are delusions and this year is not prepared to face this he denied you're regarded it as a primary datum of the human consciousness it leads to primary as the fact that we say in C tables and chairs or that we have some kind of um perception of other objects in nature at least as primary as that the fact that we know that there are certain things which of which it could be said that we could either do them or refrain from doing them this is a basic data this is so then it cannot be that values namely aims or ins which human beings strive for are in some sense Outsiders whether in nature or in God because if they were Outsiders and if they determined us then we should be slaves to them it would be an extremely Sublime form of slavery but slavery nevertheless to be unslaved like to be free is therefore in some sense to commit yourself freely to some kind of moral values you can commit yourself to it or not but the central Act is the commitment not the nature of the value itself but the fact that you commit yourself to it what you commit yourself do is another matter that might be discoverable by rational means but the commitment or the non-commitment that alone is what makes it a value for you in other words to call a thing good or bad to call it right or wrong is in effect to say that there is a free self-committing act but later became called ongarger Behavior committal Behavior unindifferent behavior on the part of human beings now if this is so and this of course is what means by saying that men are ins and themselves they are in themselves because what else could be an end men are choosers of Acts to sacrifice a man you must sacrifice him to something higher than himself nothing is higher than that so to speak which is to be regarded as the highest moral Daniel but to call it in a high model value is to say that some men or other is prepared to live or die for it unless somebody is prepared to live or die for it there is no it in the sensible moral value a value is made a value by human choice and not by some intrinsic quality in itself out there values are not stars in some moral Heaven they are internal they are what human beings freely choose to live for to fight for to die for that I think is fundamental sermon he doesn't really give a great deal of argument for it he simply States it as more or less some evident truth in various types of propositions with more or less repeat each other sinister review that the destruction of men or the enslavement of men or the tempering of one man by another or the getting it of one another by men is for him the nightmare thought of determinism of slavery by Nature if saskant in effect that which is undoubtedly true about inanimate nature namely the law of causality where true about all aspects of human life then indeed there would be no morality for then men would be heavily conditioned by outside factors and although they might deceive themselves into supposing that they were free they would insect be determined in other words for him determinism particularly mechanical determinism is incompatible with ill freedom in any morality and Mustafa will be false by determinism he means any kind of we should speak determination by outside factors whether by material factors physical or chemical factors about which the 18th century spoke or by the passions which in fact are irresistible to men if you say about a person it is stronger than I I couldn't help it I yield it I was pushed I was unable it was it overwhelmed me you are in effect confessing to a certain kind of helplessness and slavery this need never be the case for him but the Free Will problem is of course an ancient conundrum it was invented by the stoics and it has troubled human imagination and human mind ever since it can't really saw it as a kind of fearful Nightmare and when the official solution was produced for him that while of course we choose as we choose we can choose between one thing and another nobody denies that but the object for our choice and the fact that we are likely to choose in the way in which we shall choose is determined in other words that if there are alternatives it is of course possible to do either one or the other but the fact that we are placed in a situation where these are the Alternatives and in fact more than that that our will will in fact be determined in a certain direction so that we do what we will but our will itself is not free that counts called a miserable subterfuge which should not be able to take in anybody consequently cut off all possible rules of Escape all the official routes of Escape which other philosophers frightened by the same dilemma had provided and indeed this problem although it was particularly acute for comes then proceeded to dominate European thought and indeed some extent European action ever since it's a problem which obsesses the 19th century it's a problem in which obsesses both philosophers and to some and historians in the 90s and indeed in our own Century too it is a problem which has come out with peculiar acuteness in various forms today for example in the forms of arguments between historians about the relative roles of individuals in history and vast impersonal forces social or economic or psychological it has come out in the form of various types of political Theory those who believe that men are for example determined by their objective position in a structure say the class structure and those who believe that men are not determined or attenuate not holy so determined it comes out in legal Theory between people who think that crime is in some sense a disease and should be cured by medical means because it is something which the criminal is not responsible as opposed to those who believe the criminal can choose what to do and therefore to cure him or to use medical treatment of him is in some sense an insult to his inborn human dignity this was certainly The View taken by he believed in retributive punishment he believed in retributive punishment regarded as a retrograde point of view and perhaps May indeed be it because he thought that a man would prefer to go to prison to go to hospital because he thought that if a man did something and he was blamed for it severely blamed for it or even punished for it because he might have avoided it this in some sense presupposed that he was a human being with a Power of Choice even though he may have chosen what was evil rather than treating him as in some sense conditioned by forces of which he had no control say the unconscious say the environment say the treatment of him by his parents or a thousand other factors which had rendered him incapable of acting in some other way say ignorance say physical disease of some kind the dish on the whole in some sense was a deeper insult to him inasmuch as it treated him in some sense as an animal or a thing rather than this human being and is very passionate in this point I wish to bring out this weekly full flavor of his viewers he says for him generosity for example is a vice because generosity is so to speak ultimately a form of condescensional patronage it's ultimately what they have is give to the have-nots in a world which was just generosity would not be required pity and compassion appear to come to be detestable colleges he would rather be ignored he would rather be insulted he would rather be better be treated than pitied because pity entails a certain superiority on the part of the pitya for him who is pitied and this superiority constantly denied all men are equal all men can determine themselves and if one man pit is another he is thereby reduces him in some sense to an animal or a thing or a generator pitiable or pitiful object and this vacant was the most fearful insult to human dignity and human morality that will come to moral view now the thing which frightened him was this notion of the external world as a kind of treadmill and he says if Spinoza is right and if the determinants of the 18th century are right for example helveisha so for example halbach or the scientists and the man is simply an object in nature simply a mass of Flesh and Bones and blood and nerves who is acted upon by external forces exactly as animals objects are then a man as he says is nothing but a turn spit he moves but not through his involution man is nothing but a clock he is set he ticks but he doesn't say to himself and this kind of freedom is no Freedom at all and has no moral value of any kind consequently total denial of determinism and enormous emphasis upon the human will this is what he calls autonomy and being pulled and pushed about by external factors whether they be physical or emotional he calls heteronomy let us say laws the sources of which are outside the human being now this entails a new and somewhat evolutionary view of nature which again becomes an extremely Central factor in the European Consciousness until then the attitude that was taken towards nature whatever might be meant by that word and I think some Scholars have counted in a fewer than 200 meanings I think which are attached to the word nature in the 18th century alone whatever the attitude was taken towards nature was on the whole benevolent or respectful nature was regarded as in some sense a harmonious system or at least asymmetrical well-composed system such that man suffered when in some way he got out of gear with it and therefore the way to kill human beings when they were for example criminal or unhappy was somehow to restore them to what they should be or to the bosom of nature the various views are taken of this nature as I turned to I think in my first lecture mechanistic views biological views all kinds of metaphors used organic rules physical views but always the same refrain mistress nature Dame nature Nature's leading strings which we wrote not to detect results from even Hume with the least bit of physical thinkers think get out of thoughts if they become unhappy or mad nature usually assets herself and that means certain sixth habits assert themselves and the healing process occurs the wound heals and men are reintegrated into the harmonious flow or the harmonious system where they regard nature static or the urugata as a moving Affair anyhow men are restored by being somehow reabsorbed into this large and comforting medium which man should never have visited the notion of mistress nature Dame nature something benevolent something to be worshiped something with art or to imitate something with morals or derived from something which politics are founded upon as more discussed that derogates from man's inborn Liberty of choice because nature is certainly mechanical or even if not mechanical even if it is organic attenuate every event in nature followed by a rigorous necessity from every other and therefore if man is part of nature then he is determined and morality is a hideous and very painful illusion therefore nature and count becomes at worst an enemy at best simply neutral stuff which one Mills man is as it's very conceived of as partly in nature playing his bodies in nature his emotions are in nature all the various things which are capable of making him heteronymous or depend upon something other than his true self are natural but when he is at his Freest when he's at his most human when he rises to his Noble his Heights then he dominates later that is to say he molds her he breaks her he imposes his personality upon her he does that which he chooses because he commits himself to certain ideals and by committing himself to these ideals he creates something he imposes his seal upon nature and nature therefore becomes plastic stuff some bit of nature are more plastic than others but all nature must be presented to man as something with which or upon which or at which he does something not something to which he by nature or the whole of him will generate belongs and this notion that nature is in some sense an enemy or neutral stuff is of course something relatively new legislation is moral the legislator is mad himself nature is simply inert stuff upon which man impresses himself that is why Kant acclaimed the French constitution of 1790 because he said that here at last was a form of government in which all men at least theoretically were able to vote freely to speak their views no longer to obey a government no matter how benevolent no longer obey a church no matter how excellent no longer obey principles no matter how ancient provided they were not or whatever making once man was encouraged as he was by the French Constitution to vote freely in accordance with his own inner not impulsions that his own inner decisions his own inner will he was thereby liberated and where he interpreted it correctly or incorrectly it appeared to him that the French Revolution was a great liberating act in as much as it asserted the value of individual cells and he said much the same about him American Revolution too when his colleagues deplored the terror and regarded all the events in France with undisguised horror although he didn't exactly openly approve never quite retreated from the position that at any rate it was an experiment in the right direction even if it went wrong and this on the whole indicates that it speaks a passion with which this very conventional normally very obedient very tidy old-fashioned for some provincial East fashion Professor nevertheless regarded this great opening chapter in the history of the human race the self-assertion of human beings against huge monsters as he thought of it standing over against him tradition unbreakable intern principles Kings governments parents all kinds of authority which is simply accepted because it is Authority anything but Authority was on her account's device he's not normally thought of in these terms but there is no doubt that his moral philosophy is firmly founded up on this anti-authoritarian principle now this of course assets the Primacy of the will in a certain sense was still a child of 18th century indictment because he thought that all men if their hearts were pure and what they asked themselves what it was that it was right to do would in similar circumstances arrive at identical conclusions because to all questions reason must in all men give the self-save answer this was also something which was believed in Rousseau can't used to believe that only a minority of human beings were enlightened enough or experienced enough or morally lofty enough to be able to give the correct answers under the impulse of reading Russo's Emil which he admired very greatly indeed the picture from service the only human representation that could be found above counter desk he believed that all men were capable of this any man whatever else he might lack he might be ignorant he might know no chemistry he might know no logic he might know no history but any man was capable of discovering irrational answers to the question how should I behave and all rational answers must have necessity coincide as to the fallacies in this Doctrine I shall not enter into behavior for him to take us too long but this is the only thin chord by which he is still bound to what might be called 18th century rationalism the content of the world so to speak must be similar to all men but the impulsion the notion of commitment the fact that unless there is a kind of free self-commitment to a cause reaction it is worthless that a man who simply acts from impulse however generous that a man who acts from his natural character and however Noble that a man who acts on any kind of ineluctable pressure whether it be from outside of his own inner nature that such accidentally worthless that the only thing which is worth possessing is unsettled will this is the central proposition which can't as it were put on the map and it was destined to have exceedingly revolutionary and subjective consequences which I think you could hardly have anticipated there are all kinds of versions of this Doctrine which appear to all the end of the 18th century but perhaps the most Vivid and the most interesting from our point of view is that of his faithful disciple the dramatist poet and historian children is as Intoxicated by the idea of will Liberty autonomy man on his own as controls unlike previous thinkers unlike elvisions unlike holbach who simply believed that there were certain correct answers to social questions and to moral questions and to Artistic and to economic and to effectual questions of every kind and the important thing was simply to get human beings to understand these answers accordingly how you got them to do this never really little in a strict opposition to this Schiller is as I say constantly hopping upon the fact that the only thing which makes man man is the fact that he is able to rise above nature and in some way Malta in some way crushed her in some way subjugate her to his beautiful unfettered morally directed will let me read you the kind of remarks which Schiller makes throughout his writings the kind of sentences that occur throughout his philosophical essays he constantly speaks of spiritual freedom freedom of reason the kingdom of Freedom our free self in our freedom freedom of Mind moral Freedom the free intelligence the free intelligence the very favorite phrase holy Freedom impregnable Citadel freedom and an equivalent number of expressions in which instead of the word Freedom the word independence comes in but which means for these purposes exactly the same theory of prejudice is founded upon this notion of freedom and his practice as a tragic writer and his poetry is impregnated with this notion and that is the way in which they speak perhaps more perhaps through the directory of it has a powerful effect upon romantic art both political and plastic tragedy does not consist in the mere spectacle of suffering if men were pure mind he wouldn't suffer at all helpless suffering suffering which man cannot avoid a man crushed by Misfortune is not an objective it is merely an object of horror pity and perhaps disgust the only entity which could be regarded as properly tragic is of course resistance resistance on the part of a man to whatever it is that oppresses him Leo Khan who resists his natural impulse to escape not to behave in accordance with the truth as he did regulus who surrendered himself to the carthaginians although no doubt he might have lived more comfortable and perhaps not less disgraceful life if he had remained in Rome Milton Satan after you see in the appalling spectacle of Hell nevertheless continues with his evil designs these are tedric figures because they accept themselves because they are not tempted into Conformity because they don't yield to Temptation whether of pleasure or of pain or whether physical Temptation or moral Temptation because they measure themselves they cross their arms upon the crossroads and they defy nature and Defiance but model the files in Schindler's case of course not any interference but the violence in the name of some ideal to which you seriously commit yourself that is what makes for Treasure there because it is a conflict and it is a conflict which man is grappling against forces either too great for him or not as the case may be Richard III Iago are not tragic figures for him because they behave like animals they behave under the impulse of passion and therefore he says of course when we're not thinking about human beings if we're not thinking in moral terms we watch with Fascination the Marvel is the ingenious behavior of these fascinating Human animals who do behave in the most remarkable fashion the Shakespeare's genius and fantasy makes them go through extraordinary convolutions intellectually in some respects Superior to those of the average man but as soon as you think of what is happening you realize that they are behaving under the influence of passion which they cannot avoid once this is true they are not human beings and we are ashamed and disgusted we think they are not behaving as food beings they have resigned from their humanity and they are therefore detestable and dehumanized and therefore they are not tragic figures nor I regret to say his Lovelace in Richardson's novel who is simply an amorist who pursues various ladies under the impulsive ungovernable oppression if ungovernable no tragedy whatever America no Sheila thinks the drama perhaps acts as a kind of inoculation if we ourselves within the situation or ourselves in the situation of Egypt whoever it may be struggling against faith we might succumb also the terror of being in such a situation might be so great that our feelings will be numbed or we should be driven out of our minds and therefore we cannot tell how we should behave but by watching these things on the stage we remain relatively cool and detached and therefore in some sense it performs an educational function we observe what it is for a man to behave like a man and for a man to behave like a man is the purpose of art is the purpose at least of dramatic not which is concerned with your own beings to show human beings behaving in a manner which is most human in human beings that is shirtle's Doctrine and of course it derives directly from current is a moral nature herself destroys Us in the most ruthless and hideous session and this is what makes us particularly aware of the fact that we are not part of her let me read you a typical quotation the very circumstances that nature the god of the whole knocks all the rules which are understanding prescribes for her that she proceeds on her free and capricious career and Treads in the dust the creations of wisdom without regard for them that she snatches up what is significant and what is Trivial what is noble and what is common and involves them in a hideous identical disaster that she preserves a world of ants and seizes man her most glorious creature in her Giant's arms and crushes him that she often dissipates man's Muslim arduous achievements and indeed her own most arduous achievements in one frivolous hour and devotes centuries to a work of unnecessary Follet that is typical of nature so much the better we welcome this we welcome it not because we suffer we welcome it because it underlines and emphasizes and brings out the fact that this is nature and not art this is nature and not man this is nature and not morality and therefore makes for a vast contrast between nature which is this Elemental capricious perhaps causal perhaps trans directed entity and man who has immorality distinguishes and good and evil the dutiful the ugly the good and the bad and acts accordingly and acts accordingly if need be against nature that I think is the central Doctrine initial and this I think emerges in most of his Prejudice let me give a very typical example which will show to what links he went he rejected the canteen solution fundamentally because it seemed to him that the will liberate us from nature it puts us into a very narrow moral path of too Grim to confining a calvinist world the path in which the only alternatives are either being the placing of nature or following this Grim path of Lutheran Duty which is what thought in terms of is something which maims and destroys and cramps and crimps human nature it man is to be free he must be free not merely to do his duty he must be free to choose between either following nature or during his duty quite freely he must stand above both Duty and nature and be able to choose either in discussing euripides of media he makes this point media if you remember it's a play by euripides in which the princes of cultists because she becomes angry with Jason who first Rescuers having cold case or an abducts and then abandons her proceeds to kill her children in fact I think she boils them alive doesn't approve of this action particularly but he says that media is nevertheless far loftier than Jason because media defies naturally defies nature in herself she defines her maternal Instinct she defies her own affection for her children she arises above and she acts freely what she does may be abominable but in principle she is somebody who is capable of reaching loftier Heights but country is free and not under the impulsion of nature then poor Philistine Jason who is a perfectly decent Athenian of his time and generation and who lives a perfectly ordinary life not entirely blameless but not tragically Sinister either and who simply drifts along with the tide of conventional sentiment that is perfectly worthless media at least is somebody Jason is nobody and this I think is roughly speaking the kind of category which he uses in his other place as well Fiasco which is one of those early plays is the Tyrant of Genoa and no doubt he does wrong he oppresses the Genovese still although he does what is bad he is superior to the knaves and the fools the ignoramuses and the rebel of Genoa whom who need a master and to whom he dominates and no doubt it isn't maybe right for the Republican leader um vereena to drown him as frankly he does on the play nevertheless we lose something in Fiasco he is as a human being qualitatively superior to the persons who correctly murder him this is roughly speaking Schiller's Doctrine and it is the beginning if you like of that great doctrine of the Great siddha and the Superfluous man which was then destined to play a certain part in 19th century art their stuff died quite uselessly Renee in chateaubriand's the story of the same name dies quite uselessly they die uselessly because they belong to a society which is incapable of making use of they are Superfluous persons they are Superfluous because they are morality which is really Superior we are meant to understand to the society around them has no opportunity of assetting itself against a fearful opposition offered by the Philistines these slaves the heteronomous creatures of the society in which they live this is the beginning of a long generation a long line of Superfluous men particularly celebrated in Russian literature of Liberty of visgania Negan of turgeniev Superfluous persons of oblovov of all the various characters who occur in the Russian novel up to and including Dr Zhivago this is the origin of this and then there is the other line The Men Who say that if Society is bad if it is impossible to obtain the proper morality if everything one does is obstructed if there is nothing to be done then down with the society let it be ruined Let It Go all crime is permitted and this is the beginning of the Great Escape the nutrient figure who wishes to raise to the ground a society whose system of values is such that a superior person who truly understands what it is to be free cannot operate in terms of it and therefore prefers to destroy it and prefers indeed to destroy the principles in terms of which he himself sometimes acts prefers self-destruction suicide to continue to drift along simply as an object in an uncontrollable stream this I think is the beginning of Schiller Under the Influence oddly enough of Kant who would have been horrified to perceive any such consequences of his perfectly Orthodox half pietist half historical Doctrine now this I think is one of the great motifs certainly in the Romantic Movement and if you like to ask when chronologically does this occur it's not all altogether difficult to identify it towards the end of the 60s Lessing wrote a play called minaf and barenhelm I shall not attempt to summarize the plot of this not altogether interesting play Beyond simply saying that the hero of it is a man called major telheim who is an animal who is badly treated Injustice is done to him and because he has a very acute sense of his own honor he refuses to meet the lady whom he loves and who loves him because he supposes that she may suppose that he has performed an act which is not altogether honorable although he is in fact quite innocent and because she may think it therefore it is impossible for him to face her until and unless it has been made quite clear that in fact he is innocent and in fact does not deserve any possible attitude a negative attitude which a conceivable misunderstanding of his part might entail he behaves very honorable foolishly blessing's point is that although he's a good man and indeed a nice man nevertheless he's not a very sensible man and in the end the player is quite happily because in fact the lady turns out to be a great deal more sensible than the gentleman and she manages to create a situation in which his innocence is triumphantly displayed and are united and are happy forever we are meant to understand but so the telheim museum is in some sense a man who is wrong by Society who passion to pursue certain ideals which are his own ideals who is Thoroughly on gradually and committed who is in fact everything that Schiller wants people to be in the early 80s when he wrote the play called the robbers of which Carl Moore as I think I told you on Last Kiss is the hero Carl Moore who has also been wronged and who because he had been wrong it becomes the head of robber gang and murders and pillagers and sets buildings on fire and in the end the surrendous of the justice and causes himself to be executed Carl MOA is the same major tellheim promoted to heroic status and therefore if you wish to win is the moment at which the Romantic hero genuinely emerges he emerges at least in Germany which seems to me to be the motherland of this figure he emerges somewhere between the end of the 60s and the beginning of the 80s for what sociological reasons I shall not attempt to explain it volunteer no explanation at any way this is it in Moliere in the museum for example is somebody who is bitterly disappointed by the world who cannot abide cannot adjust himself to its false and trivial and repulsive values but he is not the hearer of the play there are more sensible persons in malayalam's play who ultimately try and bring him to his senses and do he's not detestable he's not contemptible but he's not the hero he is if anything faintly comical so is tell him faintly comical disarming agreeable amiable morally attractive but saintly Ridiculous by 1780 he's not saying the ridiculously satanic and this I think is the change that if this is a great break between what might be called a rationalist or the enlightened tradition or the tradition of the fact that there is a nature of things which must be learned which must be understood which must be known and to which people must adjust themselves at the cost of either suffering or making fools of themselves between that tradition and the traditional word on the contrary man commits himself to the values to which he commits himself and perishes if need be in their defense heroically in other words the notion of Master German heroism and a somehow equality to be worshiped for its own sake emerges seems to me to emerge about them fundamental view I think is that man goes through three stages first what he calls the note start that is to say the state which is governed by necessity whether it's a thing called is stuff Drive is literal translation that means driven by Drive in the modern psychological sense driven by the nature of matter this is a kind of Hobson jungle in which human beings collide with each other in which they are possessed by passions and by Desires in which they have no ideals in which they simply collide with each other and where it is necessary somehow to separate them from each other and this is a state which he calls Savage then there is a state which is not Savage but on the contrary which is where men in order to improve that condition adopt very rigid principles but it is possible to make out of these principles also a kind of fetish and that is what he calls the Barbarian State interestingly enough Savage for him is somebody driven by passions which he cannot Master barbarians are people who worship idols for example absolute principles which they also worship will be that name why because they're taboos because I lay down because they're a decalogue because somebody till because this precedural source of dark and unquestionable Authority that I think is what he calls barbarism then there is a synthesis of this which is neither no start on the one hand known as the moon start which is the second one which is the rational state which is not enough which is any which is only Commandments that is the third condition towards which has like all writers idealists of his time Sheila imagines at once upon a time there was a marvelous human Unity once upon a time there was a golden age when Persian was not divided from reason and Liberty was not divided into necessity and then something appalling happened culture occurred rather and as a result of this ungovernable desires jealousies envies man divided against other men men divided against themselves fraud misery alienation how are we to get back to this original state without lapsing into some kind of Innocence or childishness which is plainly neither feasible nor desirable this must be done according to Shila by means of art Liberation by Art what is this Liberation by Art he speaks about the schildreb spieltree means play drives he says that the only way in which human beings can liberate themselves is by adopting the attitude of players people games players what does he need because after him is a form of play and he explains that the difficulty for him is to reconcile on the one hand the necessities of nature which cannot be avoided and which certainly cause the stress and on the other hand these rigorous Commandments which narrow and contract life and the only way to do that is by placing ourselves in the position of people who freely imagine and freely invent if we are children at play to take the very simplest instance although it doesn't show this instance if we are children to play we can imagine ourselves to be red Indians and if we imagine ourselves to buried Indians we offer these purposes red Indians and we obey the rules of red Indians without a sense of pressure the pressure is not upon us because we indent them ourselves anything we make is ours anything we make doesn't crush us and therefore if only we can transform ourselves into creatures who obey laws not because these laws are made for us by others who obey laws not because we are terrified often we obey these laws not simply because they are laid down by some frowning deity or by terrifying men or by Nature herself if we can only obey these laws because we choose to do some freely exactly as people who play invent their game and then obey the laws with enthusiasm with passion with pleasure because this is the work of art which is constructed if only men can do that in other words if only they can convert the necessity of obeying rules into some kind of almost instinctive certainly positive free harmonious spontaneous natural operation if we can do that we are saved how I mean to be somehow reconciled to each other because human beings might play very different games and these games might easily involve them in disasters as great as any others because in some ways Shula goes back not very effectively not very convincingly to the country and principle that if we are rational if we are like the Greeks if we are in some way harmonious if we understand ourselves if we understand what freedom is if we understand what morality is if we understand what the pleasures of the Heavenly Delight of artistic creation is if we do that then surely surely we shall somehow achieve a harmonious relation with other creators other artists equally concerned not with mowing other men down not with crushing them but with living with them in some happy unitedly creative world and this is the kind of Utopia on which Schindler's thought more or less ends it's not as I say very convincing but the general direction of it is fairly clear which is that artists are people who obey rules of their own making they invent the rules and they invent the objects no matter material may be given by nature but everything else is given by them and that introduces the first note of what seems to me to be a crucial note in the history of human thought namely that ideals ends objectives are not to be discovered by intuition by scientific means by reading sacred texts by listening to experts or to authoritative persons that ideals are to be discovered not to be discovered at all they are in some sense to be invented not to be found but to be generated generated as people generate art Birds says China Inspire us because we think hierophosely that they dominate gravity they fly which we cannot do a vars is something which inspires us because in some way it is a Triumph of a brute matter Triumph if we like a form but a freely invented form not of these rigorous forms which Calvinists and lutherans and other religions or other secular tyrannies have imposed hence this passion for invented forms ideals which men make Once Upon a Time We Were integral we were Greeks this is the great myths of the Greeks which is a historically are quite false we were children playing in the sunlight and didn't distinguish between necessity and freedom between passion and reason and this was a happy and innocent type but this time it passed we cannot do this and therefore because life doesn't offer us these things because what we discover in the universe is nothing but the Grim causal treadmill we must invent our own ideals and these ideals because they're invented are in some sense in opposition to Nature in some sense it's not part of her but directed against her and therefore idealism the invention of illness is in some sense a break with nature and our task is so to subjugate nature to do that with nature which makes our very nature follower ideal in some beautiful and frictionless manner that he leaves it and that to speak is the heritage of China which after it entered very deeply into the cells of Romantics who abandoned the notion of Harmony Who abandoned the notion of reason and who became as I said in the beginning of this lecture somewhat more unrivaled the third thing card about whom I must say a word is the think of who were the philosopher and the disciple of and who's also to some degree added to this particular notion of Freedom a particularly passionate exposition of it let me read you something by him and you will see the kind of thing and the mere mention of the name Freedom says my heart opens and flowers while the word necessity it contracts painfully this shows temperamentally the kind of person he was and indeed he said a man's philosophy is as his nature not his nature and his philosophy Hegel talked about fixed his tendency to feel Gloom horror abhorrence and the mere thought of the Eternal laws of nature and their strict necessity there are people temperamentally who are depressed by the thought of the Hideous order the unbreakable symmetry the inescapable kind of world in which everything follows everything else in some unbreakable orderly totally unalterable way and certainly fish to belong to these contribution to the particular to what might be called romantic thought consists in this he says if you are simply a contemplative being and ask for the answers to for example to what to do or how to live in the realm of knowledge you will never discover an answer you will never discover an answer simply because knowledge always presupposes some larger knowledge you arrive at the proposition and you ask for the authority and then some other knowledge some other proposition is brought in in order to validate the first one and then that proposition in turn needs validation and some wider generalization is needed for the purpose of bolstering up the earlier and so on at infinitum and therefore there is no end to the search and we simply end with a spinosis system which at best is simply a rigid logical unity in which there is no room for movement this is not true our lives do not depend upon contemplative knowledge life doesn't begin with disinterested contemplation of nature or objects life begins with action knowledge is an instrument as afterwards William James and and Bergstrom and many others were to repeat knowledge is simply an instrument provided by nature for the purpose of effective life of action knowledge is knowing how to get on knowing what to do knowing how to be knowing how to adapt things to our youth knowing in other words so to speak how to live and what to do in order to perish in some semi-instinctive version and this knowledge which is the acceptance of certain things in the world really nearly because we can't help it because it is presupposed in the biological urge in the necessity of living this is for Victor a kind of Act of Faith we do not act because we know he says I quote him we know because we are called upon to act knowledge is not a passive State external nature impinges upon us and stops us and is clay for our creation we have freedom again then he makes an important proposition things are what they are not because they are what they are but because I make themselves things depend on the way in which I treat them what I need them for it is a kind of early but extremely far-going packages food is not what I hunger for it is made food by my Hunger he says I do not hunger for food because it is laid beside me because I hunger the object becomes food I do not accept what nature offers because I must that's what animals do that's what lock and accounts that human beings did but this is false I do not accept what nature offers because I must identically register what occurred like a kind of machine I do not accept what nature offers because I must I believe it because I will who is master nature or I I am not determined by ends ends are determined by me the world he finally says is a poem dreamed out in my inner life this is a very dramatic very political way of saying that experience is something which I determine because I act because I live in a certain way things appear to me in a certain fashion the world of a composer is different from the world of a butcher the world remained in the 17th century is different from the world of men in the 12th century there may be certain things which are common but there are more things or more important things that innovate which for him are not and schregel said rubbers are romantic because I make some romantic nothing is romantic by Nature today we deny freedom is action not from contemplative state to be free says 50 is nothing to become free is the very heaven I make my world as I make a pearl yet of course freedom is double-edged because I am free I'm able to exterminate others I'm capable of committing evil acts Savages exterminate each other and civilized Nations as Fiction with a certain presence civilized Nations using the power of law of unity and of culture will go on Exterminating each other culture is not a deterrent to violence and this certainly was a statement which the whole 18th century would unitedly have rejected for the 18th century culture of other deterred to violence because culture of knowledge and knowledge proved the inadvisibility of violence this was not safe not cultural the only deterrent of violence is some kind of moral regeneration man shall be and do something the whole notion of Victory is that man in some sense a kind of continuous action not even an actor but a kind of continuous action and in order to rise to his full height he must constantly constantly go on generating and creating a man who does not create a man who simply accepts what life our nature offers him is in some sense dead and this is true not only of human beings but also of Nations I will not go in here into the political implication to fix this Doctrine fixed it began by talking about individuals then he asked himself what was an individual how could one become a perfectly free individual when I was account become perfectly free so long as one is three-dimensional object in space because nature can find one in a thousand ways now for the only perfectly free being is something larger than man it's something internal although I cannot force my body I can't force my spirit for 50 days not the spiritual individual man but something which is common to many men and it is common to many men because each individual spirit is imperfect because it is to some extent hemmed in and confined by the particular body which is just unfortunate has to have entered but if you ask what is yours did it pure spirit is some kind of mystical entity rather than God a central fire of which we are all individual Sparks a mystical notion which goes back it at least to Burma gradually after Napoleon's invasions and the general rise of nationalist sentiment in Germany fish they began thinking that human beings were perhaps what he understood that a man was made a man by other men that a man was made a man by education by language language was not invented by me it was invented by others and I am part of some common stream in which I am an element my tradition my custom my Outlook everything about there is to some extent the creation of other men with whom I form an organic Unity instead gradually he moved from the notion of the individual as an empirical human being in space to the notion of the individual and something larger say a nation say a class say a sect now if once you move to that then of course it becomes its business to act it becomes its business to be free and for a nation to be free needs to be free of other nations and if other nations obstruct it it must make more and so fix the ends as a kind of rabid German Patriot and nationalist who says the world cannot be half slave and half free if we are a free Nation if we are a great Creator engaged upon creating those great values which in fact if history has imposed upon us because we happen not to have been corrupted by the great decadence which has fallen upon the Latin Nations if we happen to be in some sense healthier more vigorous even if it's more barbarous than those decadent Beatles and francophobia emerges again those decadent peoples who are nothing but the debris of what was once no doubt a very respectable Roman civilization if that is what we are then we must be free at the extent no matter of what and therefore since the world cannot be half slave and half free we must conquer the others and absorb them into our texture to be free is to be free of obstacles to be free is to make free with to be free is so to speak to be able not to be obstructed by anything in the full exercise of your enormous Creative Drive and so we get the beginnings of this notion of vast nationalist or vast class inspired Collective drives forward a kind of mystical notion of men creatively lundering forward for the purpose of not being frozen not being dead not being oppressed by anything which is static whether it be static nature or whether it be institutions moral principles political principles artistic principles or anything else which is not made by them and which is not in process of constant fluid transformation this is the beginning of this vast mystical drive forward on the part of inspired individuals or inspired Nations constantly creating themselves afresh constantly aspiring to purify them ourselves and to reach some unheard of height of endless self transformation endless self-creation as it were works of art constantly engaged in creating themselves forward forward like a kind of vast Cosmic design perpetually engage renewing itself this half metaphysical half religious notion which certainly emerges from the silver pages of in which country repudiated with the greatest possible Veer monthly integration this mystical and and semi-theological notion was destined to have an extremely violent effect built upon German politics and German morals but also upon German art German prose and German verse and then by natural transference upon the French upon the English as well it is about German Romantic Poets English Romantic Poets and French Romantics that I propose to talk next time both in their artistic capacity and in the Curious moral and political influence which they undoubtedly have and both on their own time and on ours [Applause] today I said that I would speak about the final eruption of what I last time called unbridled romanticism the three great Tendencies according to August Wilhelm Schlegel who I suppose wrote most authoritatively about this movement and was indeed a part of it himself the three great friends which most profoundly influenced the entire movement both aesthetically and morally and politically were in this order the theory of knowledge of the French Revolution and gerta's Famous novel wilhelmeister I think this is probably a just attribution and I should like to make it clear why this was so or and in what sits I spoke to you last time about Victor and about his glorification of the active Dynamic and imaginative self the the insta brought into both theoretical philosophy and the theory of Art and to some extent of life was roughly speaking this one he accepted the view of the empiricists of the 18th century that there was some problem about what was meant by speaking about oneself Hume had said that when he looked within himself as people normally do it when he introspected he discovered a great many Sensations emotions fragments of memory fragments of Hope and fear all kinds of small psychological units as it were but he failed to perceive any entity which could just be called a self and Alpha concluded that the self is not a thing not an object of direct perception but perhaps simply a name for the concatenation of experiences simply a kind of string which held together the onions out of which human personality and human history was formed except that there was no string this proposition was accepted on the whole by certainly by who then made Valiant efforts to recapture some kind of self but much more passionately by the German Romantics in particular Victor who laid down the doctrine that it was quite natural that the self should not emerge in cognition when you are heavily absorbed in an object whether in looking at a material object in nature or in let's say listening to sounds music or something else or in any other kind of process in which there is an object before you in the contemplation of which you are wholly absorbed then naturally you are pretend to not aware of yourself as the absorber you become aware of yourself only when there is some kind of resistance you become aware of yourself not as an object but as that which is obtruded against by some kind of recalcitant reality it is when you are looking at something and something intervenes when you are listening to something and there is some kind of obstacle it is the impact of the obstacle upon you which makes you aware of yourself as an entity different from the not self as it were which you are trying in some sense to understand or to feel or perhaps to dominate conquer alter mold It Anyway do something to or at and therefore they fix the induction which then becomes the Orthodox doctrine of not any Romantic Movement but of a great deal of psychology besides is that the eye the self-indexes the word is not the same as me me is something with that you can introspect which psychologists talk about with scientific criticism can be written about an object of some kind of inspection an object of study an object of psychology sociology and the like but there is a kind of non-accusative eye the Primal nominative but simply through being impacted upon and this is called the anshos fictional impact and it appeared to him to be the fundamental category which dominated all experience that is to say that when you asked yourself what reason you had for supposing the world existed what reason you had for supposing you were not deluded what reason you had for supposing that so ellipsism was not true and that everything was not a figment of your imagination or in some other way delusive and deceiving the answer was that you could not doubt that some kind of clash or Collision occurred between you and what you wanted between you and what you wish to be between you and the stuff upon which you wish to as it will impose your personality and which protento resisted in the resistance emerged the self and the not self without the not self no sense of the self without the sense of the self no sense of the not self this was so to speak a primary datum more radical more basic than anything which the later supervened upon it or could be deduced from it the world as described by The Sciences was in some sense an artificial construction the relatively to this absolutely primary irreducible fundamental datum not even of experience would be this is roughly speaking features Doctrine and from this he expands the whole vast Vision which then proceeds to dominate the imaginations of the romantics by which the only thing which is worthwhile as I tried to say last time was the exfoliation of this particular self it's creative activity it's in position of forms upon matter it's penetration of other things it's creation of values its dedication of itself to these values and this of course can have its political implications also I think hinted at last time if the self is no longer identified with the individual but in some super personal entity such as a community or a church or a state or a class which then becomes this huge intrusive forward marching will which imposes its particular personality upon both the outside world and upon its own constituent elements constituent Elements which might be composed of human beings who then are reduced to the role of Simply being ingredients of or parts in in some much bigger much more impressive much more historically persistent personality let me read you a passage from Victor's famous speeches to the German Nation delivered when Napoleon had conquered Prussia this speech was delivered to not very many people and had no great impact as when it was delivered fixed there was a poor speaker and coughed a great deal during his delivery nevertheless when they were read afterwards It produced the vast nationalist upside revealing and went on being read by Germans throughout the 19th century and became their Bible after 1918. I shall not attempt to read much more to the few lines out of this little book of lectures which will indicate the kind of tone and the kind of propaganda which featured at this period was engaged in making she says either you believe in an original principle of man a freedom a perfect factability an infinite progress of our species or you believe in none of this you may even have a feeling or some kind of intuition of its opposite all those who have within them a creative quickening of life or else assuming that such a gift has been withheld from them at least await the moment when they are caught up in the Magnificent torrent of flowing in the original life oh have some confused presentment of such freedom and help towards this phenomenon not hatred nor fear but a feeling of love these are part of Primal Humanity these may be considered as a true people these constitute the UL Falk the Primal people I mean the Germans all those on the other hand who have resigned themselves to represent only the derivative the second-hand product who think of themselves in this way become such an effect and shall pay the price of their belief they are a mere annexed life not for them those Pure Springs would flowed before them and which still may be flowing around them they are but an echo coming from a distant Rock from a voice which is now silent they are extruded from the old folk they are strangers they are Outsiders the nation which Bears the name of German to this day has not ceased to give evidence of a creative and original activity in the most diverse fields he then goes on and this is the principle of exclusion that I adopt all those who believe in spiritual reality those who believe in the freedom of the life of the spirit those who believe in the Eternal progress of the spirit and through the instrumentality of Freedom whatever build our native land whatever the language which they speak they are our race they are part of our people or they will join it later soon all those who believe in arrested being in retrogression in Eternal Cycles even those who believe in inanimate nature and put her at the Helm of the world whatever I'll be thy native country whatever be thy language they are not Germans they are strangers to us and one would hope that one day it will be holy Qatar from our people now this is of course I mean to do fixed Justice was not a chauvinistic German sermon because I think by Germans he meant hegelman all the Germanic people perhaps it doesn't make it very much better but it was a little better it includes it includes the French it includes the French it includes the English includes all the Nordic peoples and it includes some of the Mediterranean peoples as well but even so the heart of the sermon is not simply patriotism or simply an attempt to arouse the waning German Spirit crushed under the heel of Napoleon the main thing is this broad distinction between those who are alive and those who are dead those who are echoes and those who are voices those who are indexes and those who are the genuine articles there's a genuine building that is featured as fundamental distinction and this really bounded spell upon the mind of a great many young German was born somewhere around the late 1770s and early 1780s the fundamental notion is not cogito Augusto curiously enough the French psychologist writing it about the same time was developing the same kind of psychology that personality was only to be learned through effort through trying through hurling yourself against some obstacle which made you feel yourself holy in other words you only felt yourself properly in a moment of resistance or opposition Mastery titanism is what of course this leads to as an ideal both in private and in public life let me say a few words although it's very unjust to him to do so about the somewhat analogous but in certain respects profoundly different doctrine of 50's younger contemporary chilling who I suppose had a great aim for the coverage certainly than any other thinker and certainly a profound influence upon German thought as well though he is very seldom right now partly because most of his Works appear today exceedingly opaque not to say unintelligible shooting says that unlike Victor who distinguished between the living principle of the human will and nature which was as it were as encountered dead stuff to be melded as opposed to some Harmony to be fitted into selling maintained a mystical vitalism for him nature was itself something alive a kind of spiritual self-development he saw the world as something which begins in the state of brute unconsciousness and gradually comes to consciousness of itself beginning as he says from the most mysterious beginnings beginnings a little dark developing unconscious will it gradually grows to self-consciousness nature is unconscious will man is will come to consciousness of itself Nature has various stages of the will every stage of nature is a will in some state of his development first there are the rocks in the earth which are the will in the state of total unconsciousness this is an ancient Renaissance Doctrine not even to go further diagnostic sources then gradually life enters into them and there is the early life of the first biological species and then come the plants and then come the animals the progressive self-consciousness the progressive beating of the will through towards the realization of some kind of purpose nature strives after something but is not aware that it strives for it man begins to strive and becomes aware of what that he is striving for by striving successfully for whatever it is that he may be striving for he brings the whole universe to higher consciousness of itself for shelling God was roughly speaking a kind of self-developing principle of Consciousness yes he said God is Alpha and Omega Alpha is unconscious omega's full Consciousness come to itself God is a kind of progressive phenomenon a sort of form of Creative Evolution from which indeed bergson took it for there is very little Doctrine which was not previously in shelling this is the dog found influence upon certainly upon Germany's static philosophy in the philosophy of art because if everything in nature is living and if we ourselves are simply its most of conscious Representatives the function of the artist is to delve within himself and above all delve within a dark and unconscious forces which move within himself and in some way bring these to Consciousness by the most agonizing and violent struggle within himself that is the shredding's doctrine nature does this too there are struggles within nature every volcanic eruption every phenomenon such as magnetism and electricity was by shedding in some way interpreted as being a struggle for self-assertion on the part of blind mysterious forces except that it man they became half conscious it only works of art for him would you have any value at all and this is a Doctrine which not only culbridge but other art critics some were subsequently influenced by the only works of art which have any value at all are worked about which are similar to Nature in some way in conveying the pulsations are not heavily conscious life any work of art which is fully self-conscious is a kind of photograph for him any work of art which is simply a copy which is simply a piece of knowledge something which like science is simply the product of careful observation and then of noting down in scrupulous terms of what you've seen in a fully Lucid accurate and scientific manner that is death life in the work of art is the analogous some kind of common quality which it has with what we admire in nature namely some kind of power false energy life Vitality bursting forth and that is why the great portraits a great statues great works of Music are called great because we see in them not merely the surface we've seen them not merely the technique we've seen them not merely the form which the artists perhaps consciously imposed but also something in which the artist may not be highly aware namely pulsations within him of some kind of infinite Spirit of which he happens to be the particularly articulate and self-conscious representative the pulsations of the spirit which are also at a lower level pulsations of nature so that the work of art has the same effect the same revitalizing effect upon the man who looks at it or who listens to it has certain phenomena of nature where this is lacking when the whole thing is holding conventional so to speak done according to rules done in full subconscious blaze of complete awareness of what one is doing the product is of necessity elegant symmetrical and dead that is the fundamental romantic anti-enlightenment doctrine of Art and this of course has had a very considerable influence upon all critics who regard the unconsciousness having some part not merely the old platonic theories of divine inspiration and the ecstatic artist who is not really aware of what he's doing the Plato's doctrine of the ion in which the god blows through the artist and he doesn't know what it is that he's doing because something more powerful inspires him as it were from outside but in all the doctrines which take an interest in and regard it as valuable to consider the element of the unconscious subconscious pre-conscious and so forth in the work either of the individual artist or of a group a nation a people a culture this of course goes directly back to herder of what I spoke to who also regards focused on folk dancing and so forth as the articulation of some kind of not holy self-aware spirit with elimination and worthless unless it is dead now it cannot be said that Shilling wrote these things down with a very great deal of clarity nevertheless he wrote very rapidly and had a very considerable effect upon his contemporates let me tell you the first great Doctrine which really emerges from this combination of fixed his Doctorate of the will and Shillings doctrine of the unconscious which are the really the great formative factors in what might be called the aesthetic doctrine of the Romantic Movement and subsequently it's political and ethical doctrines as well and that is really I think it would be fair to say the doctrine of symbolism symbolism is something which is very Central in all romantic thoughts that has always been noticed by all critics of this note now let me try and make this as clear as I'm able although I don't claim to understand it entirely I then came to understand it entirely because as shelling very rightly says what Romanticism truly is is a Wildwood a labyrinth in which the only guiding thread is the will and the mood of a poet as I have no poet I cannot pull together trust myself to give a full exposition of this particular Doctrine version to my best there are two kinds of symbols to put it it's really simple it's not a conventional symbols and symbols of some a different kind conventional symbols often are difficulty there are symbols which we invent for the purpose of meaning certain things and there are rules about what they mean the red and green traffic lights mean what they mean by convention red lights means that motor cars may not pass and there are simply another form of saying do not pass do not pass is itself the form of symbolism linguistic symbolism which itself stands for some kind of ban on the part of persons in authority and Hills within it some kind of threat a perfectly understood threat that if you disobey this particular order da consequences may follow now this is an ordinary symbolism such as it is in for example artificially invented languages scientific treatises and any kind of conventional symbolism invented for a specific purpose where the meaning of the symbol is laid down by rule but there are obviously are symbols not quite of this kind I don't wish to enter into the theory of symbolism in general but for my particular purpose what these people meant by symbolism was symbolism for something which could only be expressed symbolically and could not be expressed literally the traffic situation is such that if instead of a green and red light you were to put up signs saying stop or go or if instead of that you even placed persons of obvious authority to cry through megaphone stop and go this would serve its purpose in a certain sense equally well at least so far as grammatical purposes are concerned now if you asked for example in what sense a national flag waving in the wind which arouses emotions people's breaths is simple or in what sense Mercier is a symbol or to go a little further in what sense for example say a cathedral is a quite a part in the question of apart from its function as a building in which religious rights occurred which religious Services occur in what sense a Gothic cathedral built in a particular way is a symbol for some kind of the particular religion which it houses or in what sense sacred dancers or symbols or in what sense any kind of religious ritual is a symbol whatever it may be or in what sense the karaba stone is a great symbol to the Muslims the answer will be that what it symbolizes is literally not expressible in any other way if you say would you spell out for me what it is that the word England stands for in the sentence England expect every mandatory's Duty let us say when NASA did it and then you begin to spell out you see England means a certain number of persons a certain number of featherless bites with reason inhabiting a certain Island at a particular moment in the early 19th century well it clearly doesn't mean that it doesn't mean any particular it doesn't simply mean a group of persons with names and addresses known to Nelson whom in some sort of way he could if he wished and took enough trouble spell out it clearly doesn't mean that because they heard the emotive force of the word England extends over something both Vega and profound and if you say what exactly is it the word England stands for here would you so to speak unpack it would you unpack it would you give me um however tedious it may be the literal equivalent of what this is a shorthand for this will not be easy to do nor will it be very easy if you say what is it that the Kaaba Stone stems for what is it that this this particular sacred this prayer stands for what is it that this Cathedral means to the people who come to Worship in it apart from associations of a vaguely emotional kind a patrol penumbra it isn't simply that it arouses emotion immersion might be aroused by the singing of birds emotion might be aroused by a sunset but a sunset is not a symbol and the singing of birds is not symbolic but the cathedral is a symbol a religious right is a symbol the raising of the host is a symbol to the worshipers and the question arises what is symbolic of now the whole of the Romantic Doctrine maintained that there is an infinite striving forward on the part of reality the universe rounds that there is something which was infinite something which is in some sense inexhaustible of which the finite attempts to be the symbol but of course cannot be you seek to convey something which you can only convey by such means as you have a talk amount but you know that this cannot convey the whole of what you are seeking to convey because this whole is literally infinite that is why allegories are used that is why symbols are used and allegory is a representation in words or in paint of something which has its own meaning but also stands for something other than itself when an allegory stands for something other than itself that's what it stands for for those who really believe in anegorism who say that the only mode of profound speech is allegorical as shelling believed as the romantics in general believed what the allegory stands for is X hypothesis not stateable itself and that is why the allegory has to be used and that is why allegories and symbols are of necessity the only mode which I have of conveying that's what I wish to convey now what is it that I wish to convey I wish to convey of course this stream of which this speaks I wish to convey something immaterial and I have to use material means for it I have to convey something which is inexpressible and I have you to use expression I have to use I have to convey perhaps something unconscious and I have to use conscious means and I know in advance that it won't succeed and cannot succeed and therefore all I can do is to get nearer and nearer in some asymptotic approach I do my best but it is an agonizing struggle in which if I'm an artist or indeed any kind of self-conscious thinker for the German Romantics I'm engaged in the whole of my life in a certain sense this is something to do with the notion of dips the illusion of depth is something with which philosophers seldom deal nevertheless it is a concept perfectly susceptible to treatment and indeed one of the most important of the categories that we use when we say that a work is profound or deep quite a powerful effect that this is obviously a metaphor I suppose from Wells which are profound and deep when one says that someone is a profound writer or a profound picture or a work of music is profound it's not really care what we mean but we certainly do not wish to exchange it for some other word such as dutiful or important or constructed according to rules or even immortal when I say that Pascal is profounder than Descartes although Descartes out was a man of Genius all that Dostoyevsky or may not like is a profounder writer then told story whom I may like much better or any of these things if I say that Kafka is a profound or writer than Hemingway or something of that kind if I say that what exactly am I trying unsuccessfully in a sense to convey by means of this metaphor which remains metaphorical because I have nothing better that I can use according to the romantics and I think this is one of the principal contributions to understanding in general according to the romantics what I mean by depth so that they don't discuss it under that name is inexhaustibility unembraceability in the cases of what might be called beautiful but not profound say works of art or even pieces of prose fiction or philosophy I can translate into perfectly Lucid literal terms I can explain to you say about some musical work of the 18th century well-constructed melodious agreeable even perhaps the work of Genius why it is made and even why it gives pleasure I can tell you that certain kind of harmonies are the kinds of things which human beings feel a particular kind of pleasure I'm listening to I can describe this pleasure perhaps quite minutely by all kinds of ingenious introspective devices if I'm a marvelous describer if I Am Bruce if I am told story if I am a well-trained descriptive psychologist I might succeed in giving you some kind of version of your actual emotions when listening to a particular piece of music or reading a particular piece of prose which is sufficiently similar to what insects you are feeling or thinking at this particular moment to be regarded as an adequate prose translation of what is occurring scientific true objective verifiable and so on in the case of Works which are profound the more I say the more remains to be said there is no doubt that although I attempt to describe it it's quite clear as soon as I speak it becomes quite clear that no matter how long I speak new Chasm is open no matter how what I say I always have to leave three dots at the end whatever description I give always opens the doors to something further something even darker perhaps but certainly something which in principle is incapable of being reduced to precise clear verifiable objective prose and that being so this I think is certainly one of the meanings of what is meant by profound the notion of irreducibility the notion that I am forced in discussing it first in describing it to use language which is in principle not only today but forever inadequate for its purpose I do my best but I know that it cannot be exhausted and the modern exhaustible it seems to me to be and The Wider the region to which it seems to be to apply the more chasms open the deeper the chasms and the larger the number of which is very crude The Wider the area of which they open the more liable I am to say that this particular proposition is profound and not merely true or interesting or a losing or or original or whatever else I might be tempted to say when for example someone like Pascal says the in the famous remark that the heart had this reason as well as the head when Gerta says no matter how hard we try there will always be an irreducible element of anthropomorphism in everything we do and think these remarks have struck people as profound for this reason because wherever they apply them they open new visitors and these visitors are not reducible not embraceable not describable not collectible not as it were you have no formula which will by deduction lead you to all of them this I think is really the fundamental notion of depth in the romantics and this is what all this not all but most of this talk about the finite standing for the internet the material standing for the immaterial the dead standing for the living space standing for time word standing for something which isn't so wordless this is what to a large degree it relates to this exactly can the sacred be seized asked Friedrich Schlegel and you replied no it can never be seized because the mirror in position of form deforms it and this is fundamentally what I think runs through the entire theory of life end of Art what this leads to you know certain exams are two quite interesting and obsessive phenomena which then are very very present both in 19th and in 20th century thought and feeling one is Nostalgia and the other is paranoia of a certain kind Nostalgia The Nostalgia is due to the fact that since the infinite cannot be exhausted and since we are seeking in some sense to embrace it nothing that we do will ever satisfy us when novalis was asked why he thought he was tending what his art was in some sense about he said I'm always going home always to my father's house which was in a sense a religious remark but what of course he meant was that all these attempts at the Exotic the strange the furry and the odd all these attempts to emerge from the empirical framework of daily life of writing fantastic stories with Transformations and transmogrifications of the most peculiar kind attempts at writing down stories which are symbolic or allegorical or contain all kinds of mystical unveiled references esoteric imagery of the most peculiar kind which is preoccupied critics for years these things are all attempts to go back to go home to what is pulling and drawing him this famous infinite zaynz of the romantics this search for the blue flower as novelis called it the search of the blue flower is an attempt to dissolve myself in the infinite in some sense either to absorb it into myself somehow rather to make myself at one with it either absorb it into myself or to dissolve myself into it this is the secularized version obviously of that profound religious driving of being at one with God of Reviving The Christ Within Me of making myself one with some of the creative forces of nature in some Pagan sense which comes to the Germans from Plato from Eckhart from Burma from German mysticism from a number of other sources except that here it takes a literally in the secular form and this particular Nostalgia is the very opposite of what the enlightenment regarded as its particular contribution the enlightenment supposed that there was a closed perfect pattern of life as I tried to explain there was some kind of form of life and of Art and a feeling and of thought which is correct which was right which was true and objective and could be taught to people if anyone knew enough there was some kind of solution to our problems and if only we could construct a structure which according to the solution and then proceed to fit ourselves as it were to put it crudely into the structure we would obtain answers both to problems of thought and the problems of action but if this is not thorough if if hypothesis the universe is a movement and not at rest if it is a form of activity and not statistic a lump of stuff if it is infinite and not finite if it is constantly varying and never still never the same to use these various metaphors which they constantly use if it is a constant wave says it says how can we possibly even in trying to describe it what's the way to do when we describe a wave we usually end up by producing stagnant pool when we try and describe the light we can only describe it accurately by putting it out therefore don't judge attempt to describe it but of course you can't not attempt to describe it because that means to stop expressing but to stop expressing is to stop living for these Romantics to live is to do something to do is to express your nature to express your nature is to express your relation to the universe your relation to the universe is inexpressible which was nevertheless Express and this is the agony this is the problem this is the unending James this is the yearning this is the reason why we must go to distant countries that is why we seek for exotic examples that is why we travel in the East that is why we write novels about the past that is why we indulge in fantasies and so on and so on that I think is the typical romantic Nostalgia if is the harmony the Perfection about which they talk could be granted to them they would reject it it's very much because it is in principle something which they know which is by definition something to which an approach can be made which cannot be seized because that is the nature of reality it's it remains one of the famous cynical story about someone who said to Dante Gabriel Rosetti when he was writing about the Holy Grail but Mr Rosetti when you have found the Braille what will you do with it well this is precisely the typical question to speak with the romantics do very well how to answer in that case the Gradle was in principle both undiscoverable and such that one could not avoid could not stop once her life could not be prevented from being a Perpetual search for it and that is because of the nature of the universe such as it is it might have been different but it isn't the brute fact about the universe is that it doesn't fully expressible it doesn't fully exhaustible it doesn't at rest it is at motion and this statistic is the basic datum and that is what we discover where we discovered the self is something of which we are only aware in effort effort is action action is movement movement is unfinishable so to speak a Perpetual movement that I think is the fundamental romantic image which I'm trying to convey as best I can in Words which X hypothesis I cannot convey it now the second notion which is that which I mentioned which is that a paranoia is something somewhat different there isn't optimistic version of course in the medicine but the romantics field is that by going forward by extending our Nature by destroying the obstacles in our path whatever they may be dead French rules of 18th century political and Economic Institutions of a destructive kind laws Authority any kind of cut and dried truth any kind of either rules or institutions which in some way are regarded as absolute perfect and appealable from in doing this we are liberating ourselves more and more and allowing our infinite nature to thought the greater and greater Heights and become wider deeper Freer more vital more like the Divinity towards with its drives but there is another version of the same thing a map is Mystic version which I think is courteously enough something which really obsessed in the 20th century to some extent there is the notion that although we individuals seek to liberate ourselves yet the universe is not to be tamed in this easy fashion there is something behind there is something in the dark depths of the unconscious or there is something in the dark depths of history or there is something at any rate not seized by us which in some way frustrates our dearest wishes sometimes it's conceived as a kind of indifferent or even hostile nature sometimes it is conceived as the cunning of History which optimists think Bears ever towards more and more glorious girls but pessimists think is simply like shopping for example think that is simply a huge featherless ocean of undirected will upon which we Bob like a little bit with no direction and no possibility of really either understanding the element in which we are or direct our calls upon it and this is huge powerful ultimately hostile Force to resist rich or even to come to terms with which is never of the slightest use it takes all kinds of other forms it takes much more much clearer forms it takes the form of looking for all kinds of conspiracies in history for example people begin to think perhaps history is formed by forces over which we have no control someone is at the back of it all perhaps the Jesuits perhaps the jewels perhaps the Freemasons this of course was much stimulated by attempts to explain the cause of the French Revolution we and the enlightened we the veterans we the wise we the good and the kind seek to do this or that but somehow all our efforts ended nothing a double there must be some fearful hostile source which is as it were lying in wait for us and trips us up when we're on the brink as we think of great success this takes as I say crude forms such as the conspiracy view of history but which will always look for concealed enemies sometimes for larger a larger conception such as say economic forces the forces of production in Marx or class war in Marx or a much vager and more metaphysical notion of the cunning of reason or of history in Hegel which understands its goal much better than we do and plays tricks Upon Us Hegel says the spirit cheats us the spirit intrigues the spirit lies the spirit triumphs it almost conceives of it as a kind of huge ironical aristophonics of the force which mocks at the poor human beings who are trying to construct the Little Homes upon the slopes of what they regard as a green and Flowery Mountain but which turns out to be the vast volcano of human history which is about to erupt once again ultimately perhaps for human good ultimately in order to realize itself towards an ideal but in the short run destroying a large number of innocent persons and causing a very great deal of suffering of damage this also is a romantic idea because once you get the notion that there is outside of something larger something unseasonable something unattainable you either have feelings towards it of love as fish they wanted or a fear and if you are feelings of fear it becomes paranoic and this paranoia then goes on accumulating in the 19th century it accumulates height in shopping it dominates The Works of Wagner and it comes to live climax in all kinds of works in the 20th century was obsessed by the thought of the fact that somehow no matter what we do there is some can there's a worm in the bud somewhere there is something which Dooms us the Perpetual frustration whether it be human beings we must exterminate or impersonal sources against which all effort is useless certainly works by writers like Kafka for example are filled with this peculiar sense of undirected angst of Terror of basic apprehension which isn't fixated about any identifiable object and this is very true about the early romantic works as well if you read tics stories that blonde Eggbert for example terrapinated but what always happens is that the hero Begins by doing happily then something terrible happens a Golden Bird appears before him sings a song about I'm some kite which is already a romantic concept about Solitude in the woods of a half delightful and half terrifying thought and that he kills the bird and then various misfortunes follow and he goes on killing he goes on destroying he gets enmeshed in a frightful net which some awful mysterious Falls had laid for him he seeks to liberate himself from it he murders more he struggles he fights he goes on this kind of nightmare is extremely typical of early drama romantic writing and it comes to exactly the same source which is this notion of the will the will is dominating life not Reason Not an order of things which can be studied and therefore controlled but of some kind of will so long as it is my will and the will directed towards ends which I myself manufacture it is presumably benevolent so language is the will of benevolent deity or the will of a history which is guaranteed to bring me to a happy conclusion as it is in all the um optimistic the right writings of all the optimistic historical philosophers that presumably is not too terrifying but it may turn out that the end is much blacker and more and more more terrifying and more unfathomable than I think and so the romantics tend on the whole oscillate between extremes of mystical optimism and polling pessimism and this gives our writings A peculiar kind of uneasing quality the French Revolution was the next event where the next item which I mentioned here doing something must be said the French Revolution had an obvious effect upon the Germans because of course it led as a result of the Napoleonic Wars in particular the vast of wounded National feeling which certainly fed the stream of Romanticism himself as it was and assertion of the national will come what may but it is not this aspect of it that I wish to stress the aspect I wish to stress is that although the French Revolution promised I think I said in my first lecture upon what might be called peaceful universalism the doctrine was that of unimpeded progress the classical Perfection was to be his goal once we arrived at that it would last forever upon some kind of adamantine foundations laid by human reason nevertheless the French Revolution didn't go the way it was intended and because it didn't what it attracted attention to was not at all reason peace universalism Harmony which Universal Freedom equality Liberty fraternity not these things which it was stimulated to satisfy but on the contrary it attracted attention to violence the appalling unpredictable change in human Affairs the irrationality of mobs the enormous power of individual Heroes great men evil and good who were able to dominate these mobs and alter the course of history in all kinds of ways it's really the Patriot of action in The Poetry of battle and the Poetry of death which the French Revolution in a certain sense stimulated in people's minds and imaginations not made in Germany but everywhere and therefore it had the exact opposite effect to that which it was intended to have stimulated was the notion of a mysterious Iceberg about which we didn't know enough you see the question is naturally bound to be asked why was the French Revolution a failure in the sense that after it it was fairly conspicuous that the large number of Frenchmen were not free not equal and not particularly fraternal at any rate a sufficiently large number to the cause of the problems we asked although some of them no doubt had been a lot of some of them had been improved but others had obviously deteriorated and certainly the countries around them although some persons have been liberated other persons did not feel that this had been worthwhile well the answer was various answers were given those who believe in economics said that the political makers of the Revolution ignored these facts those who believed in the monarchy or those who believed in the church said that the deepest instincts and the deepest faith of human nature had been flouted by atheistical materialism which would naturally produce consequences of a dreadful kind and this was perhaps simply the punishment of human nature or of God in accordance with your particular philosophy upon some kind of defiance of it but what it led everybody to suspect was that not perhaps enough was known the doctrines of the French philosophers which were supposedly a blueprint for the alteration of society in any desired Direction had in fact proved inadequate and the Darfur although the upper portion as the dwarf social and human life that which was visible to economists psychologists moralists writers students every kind of scholar and observer of the facts Those portions were merely the tip of some huge Iceberg of which vast section was sunk beneath the ocean floor and this bit was invisible and this was the bit which lipstick had been taken for granted a little too blandly and the tough I've injured Itself by producing all kinds of exceedingly unexpected consequences and the notion of unintended consequences the notion of the fact that although you propose it disposes although you alter nevertheless it's suddenly straightens itself and Strikes you in the face so you try and alter these things too much nature men whatever it is and then something accumulator or the nature of society or the dark Forces or the unconscious all the forces of production or the idea with a capital I it doesn't matter what the name of this vast entity is it then proceeds to strike you and strike you down that itself into the imagination of a great little person in Europe who would certainly not have described themselves as Romantics and fed the streams of all kinds of theodices the Marxist the odyss the hegelians and the great Community see how this is a great many other theological writings of our time that I think is where it begins and this fed the stream of paranoia also in the sense that it again contraduct the notion of something stronger than us some huge impersonal source which could neither be investigated nor as it were deflected and this of course did make the whole universe far more terrifying than it had been in the 18th century as for the third of these factors which I promised to mention Wilhelm Meister that was simply a novel which Romantics admired not so much for his power of Storytelling but but for two reasons first of all because it was an account of a self-formation by a man of Genius how a man can take himself in hand and by the free exercise of his Noble and unrestrained will makes himself into something this is presumably good is creative autobiography as an artist but more than that they also liked the fact that there were very sharp transitions in this novel from a piece of sober prose or some scientific description of say the temperature of water or the particular structure a particular kind of it Garden go to suddenly goes of enjoying static and poetical analytical accounts of one kind or another and bursts into poetry and then as sharply and as as quickly returns back to perfect melodious but severe Pros now these sharp transitions from poetry to prose from ecstasy to Scientific descriptions appear to them to be a marvelous weapon for the purpose of blowing up an over set reality this is how Works about should be written they should be written not in accordance with rules not in accordance not to be copies of some kind of given nature of some Natura some kind of structure of things of which the book about is an explanation or which the work of art is worth still a copy or a photograph the business of a work of art is liberators and it liberates Us by as it were ignoring these superficial symmetries of nature these superficial rules and by sharp transitions from one mode into another from poetry to produce from theology to Botany if therefore knocks down a great many of the conventional divisions by which were hemmed in and crypt and in some way implicit regarded this as a tall valid analysis of his work if you look to the certain nervousness upon these Romantics whom he and srinato regarded as rather rootless Bohemians Third Rate artists which this some of them certainly were persons of rather wild and inconsequential Life whom nevertheless because they admired him so much and worshiped him so well he didn't wish altogether to despise or to ignore and so some of the ambivalent relational occurred between them in the course of which they admired him as the greatest of German Geniuses but despised his Philistine tastes despised his cow towering to the grandiose of Weimar regarded him as having celled out in many ways and having since we have started as building the original genius Ended as a kind of silken courtier on the other hand he looked upon them as per artists covering up a certain lack of creative genius by a certain unnecessary wildness of expression but at the same time Germans admirers the only audience for the time he had and therefore not to be neglected not to be kicked away to recklessly that was roughly speaking the relation between them but it remained a very uncomfortable relation until the end of his life and certainly good to himself never lent himself the Romanticism went towards the end of his life he said Romanticism is disease classicism is Health that is his fundamental sermon even Faust which The Romantics didn't particularly admire even Faust who goes through all kinds of romantic transformations who certainly is tossed upon the Wild Waves or a great many passages in which it is clear that he's compared to a wild and rushing turret leaping from rock to rock constantly thirsty renew experience is provided by Mephistopheles Faust in the end is a drama of reconciliation in the end the point about false after having killed Gretch him after having killed Philemon and bosses after having performed a good many crimes in person part one and part two there is some kind of harmonious realization harmonious release and resolution of all these conflicts although no doubt they have caused a great deal of blood and suffering but blood and suffering were nothing to go to on the whole that is to say like Hegel on the whole he supposed that the Divine harmonies could only be made by sharp clashes by violent disharmonies which from a greater height would perceive to be contributory factors to some enormous Harmony but that is certainly not romantic that is if anything is anti-romantic because the general tendency of that is to say there is a solution a hard difficult solution perhaps the energy perceived by the mystical eye nevertheless a solution and of course in his novels go to preached exactly what the Romantic they tested in German the whole sermon is that if an emotional not occurs if there is some kind of fearful complication between let's say a married woman and her lover on their account May the easy solution of divorce or the easiest solution of the abandonment of wedlock be adopted but on the contrary resignation suffering bowing to the yoga convention preservation of the pillars of society the sermon is essentially that of order self-restraint discipline and the crushing of any kind of chaotic or anti-legal factors this to the Romantic is absolute poison there is nothing they dislike more than this in their own private lives they were some of them set in a summer disorderly the cynical the little group of Romantics who gathered in yena the two brothers Schlegel before the time in Berlin and shedding on the whole believed and preached and with violent terms the Beauties and the importance of total freedom including their free love married a lady because she was about to have a child she was a revolutionary German Lady of considerable intellect imprisoned for a Time by the Germans and Mains for having I think collaborated in the French Revolution this and then with graceful feeling yielded up to shelling this was also the earlier the case in the case of Schiller and Jean Paul the no marriage actually occurred and so on but quite apart from their personal relationships the great novel which of course in a sense Incorporated our view of life in which certainly shocked um go to profoundly was the novel Lucinda which is not perhaps a work of great literally made it but which Friedrich Schlegel published in the early 19th century and which was a kind of Lady chatterley of its time it was a highly erotic novel giving very violent descriptions indeed of various types of lovemaking as well as containing sermons of a romantic kind about the necessity of freedom and self-expression the heart of Lucinda quite apart from the erotic side is the description of what three relationship between human beings can be in particular analogies are constantly made with a little baby called guillermit who throws her legs in the air in a very free and understand them and the hero explains and says this is how one should live here is some here is a little child naked and unrestrained by convention it wears no clothes it bows to No Authority it believes in no conventional directors of its life and above all it is Idol it has no tasks to do idleness is the last spark that is left to us from the Divine Paradise from which Humanity was once expelled Freedom the capacity for throwing one's legs in the air to do anything one wishes that is the last privilege that we have in this fearful world this awful causal treadmill where nature presents upon us with such fearful savagery and so on and so on but the novel caused a very profound shock and was defended by the great Berlin preacher in language not all together under reminiscent of the ways in which various British clergymen defended later trusted his lava not very long ago spiritual and character as being in some sense moving in the same direction heirs are almost as a prop of Christian Orthodoxy so uh Lucinda which was a pornographic novel of a fourth order was represented by the Royal as being entirely spiritual in character all its physical descriptions were described as allegorical and everything in itself was described simply as a great hymn and sermon to spiritual freedom of man freed from the shackles of false condemnation well I think later in life retreat in this position and then on the whole does probably it probably probably does greater credit to his kindness and his loyalty and his generosity of heart then to his critical Acumen but that does it may the purpose of Lucinda was of course to break down conventions whenever you could break down conventions you must do so perhaps the most interesting and acute case of the breaking down of conventions is to be found in the stories of the the plays of teak for example and the stories of the famous Storyteller ETA Hoffman you see the general proposition is of the 18th indeed of all previous centuries as I uh time is to repeat is that there is a nature of things there is there is a structure of things for the romantics this was profoundly false there was no structure of things because that would hemisin that would suffocators there must be a field for Action the potential is more real than the actual what is made is dead once you have constructed a work of art abandonment because once it is constructed it's the it's done for it's yes to this calendar last year's candidate what is made what has been constructed what has been since speak already understood must be abandoned glimpses fragments intimations mystical illumination that is the only way to seize reality because any attempt to circumscribe it any attempt to give a coherent account any attempt to be harmonious to have a beginning and a middle and an end is essentially a perversion and caricature of what is in its Essence okay I'll take and shapeless and a beating stream a tremendous great stream of self-realizing will the idea of imprisoning which is absurd and blasphemous that I think is the real favorite Center of romantic Faith hence you get in hofma stories about which there is a perfectly decent City councilor book collector I think who sits in the dressing on in his room and is normally surrounded by old manuscripts and outside his door there is a brass knocker the brass knocker however at times turns into hideous apple veldor and sometimes she's an apple vendor and sometimes a grass knocker the brass knuckle sometimes Winks like the Apple vendor the Apple vendor occasionally behaves like a brass knocker as for the her master as for the respectable counselor sometimes he sits in his chair sometimes he gets into a bowl of punch and disappears into its team and goes up in the air with his feet always occasionally dissolves himself in this punch and gets drunk by other people in his peculiar Adventures the roster now this truthy which is a ordinary sort of a fantastic stories in Hoffman you see before Tuesday tables again whenever you begin the story by him you could never tell there is a cat in the room the cat maybe a cat but it may of course also be a transformed human being the cat can't quite tell it tells you it can't quite tell and this costs a certainly out of uncertainty about all the proceedings which is perfectly deliberate when Hoffman was walking across the bridge in Berlin he often felt as he was encapsulated in a glass bottle he wasn't sure whether the people he saw around him were human beings or dolls this I think was a genuine piece of psychological delusion he was in some respects psychological did not hold the normal but at the same time in his fiction the primary Motif always is the transformability of everything into everything tick writes a play in which there is I think Puss in Boots in which the king says to uh the prince who comes to see him you who come from so far away uh how is it you will speak our language so well to which the prince says and the King says why do you say hush and the prince says if I don't if we don't cease talking about the subject the play cannot continue and then some member of the audience made it up and say but this is the flaunting of all possible rules of realism it's intolerable that characters should discuss the play between them this is very deliberate in another play by teak you have a man Scaramouche I think he's riding on a donkey and suddenly there is a thunderstorm and he says but there's nothing about this in the play and my in my path there's nothing but rain I'm getting very wet he rings the bell and the mechanic comes in he says the mechanic why is it raining he says the audience likes thunderstorms to which uh Scaramouche is in in in dignified historical plays it can't rain and the mechanic says yes it can produces examples and says anyhow he's been paid to do it and then someone gets up in the audience and says You must cease this intolerable bickering the play must have some degree of Illusion it's quite impossible for a play to go on and for characters in it to discuss this technique and so on then there is in the very same play there is a play Within the play and within that play another play the audiences the audiences of all three players talk to each other and in particular one person who stands somewhere outside the play discusses the relation to the various audience to each other and so forth now the purpose of all this and after it has of course it's analog and all kinds of other in the 19th century of course it's the predecessor of tyrandella it's predecessor of dandaiism its previous years of serialism of the authority of the Absurd that is what all begins and the point of it is of course is to try and confuse reality with appearance as far as possible to in some way break down the barrier between illusion and reality to break down the barrier between dreams and reality between night and day between the conscious and the unconscious in order to produce this sense of the absolutely unbarred universe of the world this universe and of Perpetual change Perpetual transformation out of which somewhere with a powerful will can mold if only temporary anything he pleases that I think is the central doctrine of the Romantic Movement and naturally it has its political analog as well when romantic political authors begin to say the stage is not a machine the state is not a gadget if the state were the machine people would have thought of something else but they haven't the state is either a natural growth or it is an emanation of some mysterious Primal Force which we cannot understand and which has some kind of theological Authority when Adam nullah says but Christ died not for only for individuals but for states which is a very extreme statement of theological politics so in that he said and that explains that the state is a mystical institution which is profoundly rooted in the deepest possible and the least fathomable and the least intelligible aspects of human existence which are essentially In Perpetual movement in Perpetual crisscrossing movement the attempt to reduce which to constitutions to laws is doomed to failure because nothing written lives no Constitution if it is written can possibly survive because the writing is dead and the Constitution must be a living flame within the hearts of human beings who live together as one passionate mystical family when that kind of talk begins you will see that this particular Doctrine begins to penetrate into regions for which it was perhaps not originally intended and naturally it begins to have very serious and very considerably serious consequences the last point about which I wish to speak and that very briefly is the concept of romantic irony which is exactly the same irony was invention by Schlegel and the idea of irony is that whenever you see only citizens sitting about their business whenever you see a well-composed sperm composed in accordance to the rules whenever you see a peaceful institution which protects the lives and property of citizens laugh at it Market it be ironical blow it up point out that the opposite is equally true the only weapon there is against death for him and against ossification and against any form of the stabilization and speak the freezing of the live stream is by what he calls RNA with a capital I it's the score concept but the general notion of it is that corresponding to any proposition anyone May alter there must be at least three other propositions Each of which is contrary to it and Each of which is equally true all of which must be believed particularly because they are contradictory and they must be believed because they are contradictory because that is the only way of escaping from the Hideous logical straight jacket which is what he's frightened of hide your straight jacket whether in the form of physical causality whether in the form of state-created laws whether in the form of aesthetic rules about how to compose perms whether in the form of rules of perspective or rules of historical painting or rules of other kinds of painting laid down by various mandarins in France 18th century this must be escaped from it cannot be escaped by simply denying them because the denial will simply bring about another Orthodoxy it will simply bring about another set of rules contradictory of the original rules rules must be blown up as such and so these two elements the Free untrammeled Will and the denial of the fact that there is a nature of things the attempt to blow up and explode the very notion of a stable structure of anything these are the deepest and in a sense the most insane elements in this extremely vulnerable and important movement in my final lecture I shall talk about the rest of music to this because music of course is the favorite art of all these people for reasons which were made plain and then go on from there to discuss its effect in countries outside Germany in France and in England and finally upon such influence as it seems to be and it seems to be very profound and an important one which it has in the present day [Applause] propose to say however Russia it may seem what it is that the heart of Romanticism refers to me to be I should like to go back again to a theme which I spoke of in the first and second lectures on this topic namely the old tradition which is at the heart of all Western thoughts for at least two thousand years and more before the middle of the 18th century that particular attitude those particular beliefs which it appears to me Romanticism attacked and bravely damaged namely the old proposition that virtue is knowledge a proposition which is with enuncated I suppose for the first time explicitly by Socrates in the pages of Plato and which is common to him and to the Christian tradition what kind of knowledge one may disagree about one there are battles between one philosopher and another one religion and another one scientist and another between religion and science between religion and art between every kind of attitude and every kind of school of thought and every other but the battle is invariably about what is that true knowledge of reality the possession of which makes it possible for men to know what to do how to fit in the proposition that there is a nature of things such that if you know with nature and know yourself in relation with nature and if there is a Divinity if you know the Divinity and understand the relationships between everything that composes the universe then your goals as well as the facts about yourself must become clear to you and you understand what it is that you should do if you are to fulfill yourself in the manner in which your nature tries out for and for this it is necessary to know whether the knowledge is the knowledge of physics or psychology or theology or some intuitive kind of knowledge individual or public whether it is confined to experts or maybe known by every man about all these things disagreement may occur but there is such a knowledge that is the foundation of the entire Western tradition which as I say Romanticism attacked this is the view of the jigsaw puzzle of which we must teach in the fragments that is the view of the secret treasure which we beseek the instance of this view is there is a body of fact which we must submit science in submission science is being Guided by the nature of things scrupulous regards for what there is non-deviation from the nature of things understanding knowledge and their adaptation the opposite of this which is I think what the Romantic Movement proclaimed maybe summarize under two Hills one which will be familiar to from these lectures is the notion of the indomitable will not knowledge or values but that creation is what men do you create values you create goals you create ends and in the end you create your own vision of the universe exactly as artists create Works about and before the artists that created the work of art it doesn't exist it isn't anywhere there is no copying there is no adaptation there is no learning of the rules there is no external tract so to speak there is no structure which we must understand and adapt ourselves too before you can proceed the heart of the entire process is invention creation making out of literally nothing or out of any materials that may be to hand and this the central aspect of this view is of course that your universe is as you choose to make it to some degree at any rate that is the philosopher that is to some extent the philosophy of shelling that is the Insight indeed in our own day even of such psychologists as Freud who maintain that the Universe of people um possessed by one set of Illusions or possessed by another set of fantasies it will be different from those possessed by another the second proposition is that there is no and it really is in some sense connected to the first is that there is no structure of things there is no to which almost to death Joseph there is only if not the flow the endless self-creativity of the universe the universe must be conceived of not as a set of facts not as a pattern of events not as a collection of lumps in space three-dimensional entities bound together by certain unbreakable relations as for example taught to us by say physics chemistry and the other Natural Sciences the universe is a process of Perpetual forward self-trusting but Perpetual self-creation which can either be conceived of as hostile to man and say by shopping or even to some extent by nietzsa which will overthrow all human efforts to trick it to organize it to feel at home in it to make oneself as some kind of cozy pattern in which one can rest either that or friendly because you can by identifying yourself with it by creating with it by throwing yourself into this great process indeed by discovering in yourself with very creative forces which you also discover outside by identifying on the one hand Spirit on the other hand Mata by seeing the whole thing as a vast self-organizing and self-creative process by doing this you will actually at last be free understanding is not the proper term to use because understanding throughout presupposes they understand that and they understood the never and the known some kind of gap between the subject and the object But Here There Is No Object there is only the subject in some sense create thrusting it all forward the subject maybe the universe the subject maybe the individual the subject labor is a class the nation the church whatever it may is identified as the truest realities that speak in um of which the universe consists but in any case it is let's say a process of Perpetual forward creation and all schemas all generalizations all patterns put upon it are forms of distortion are forms of breaking when words were said that to dissect is to murder this is approximately what he meant and he was Master mildest of those who Express this particular point of view to ignore this to evade it to attempt to see these things as in some sense submissive to some kind of intellectualization some sort of plan that to attempt to draw up a set of rules or a set of laws or a formula and so forth is a form of self-indulgence or and in the end suicide or stupidity that at any rate is the sermon of the romantics wherever you try and understand anything by whatever Powers you have you will discover as I tried to say last time you will discover that what you are pursuing to what you are pursuing is inexhaustible that you are trying to catch the uncatchable that you are trying to apply a formula to something which evades your formula because whenever you try and nail it down new a business open and these are business opens you get other businesses the only persons who have ever made sense of reality are those who understand that to try and circumscribe these things to try and nail them down to try and describe them no matter how stupid it is a vain task and this will be true not only of science which of course does this by means with rigorous generalizations of to the romantics the most external and empty kind but even those scrupulous writers the scrupulous describers of experience realists naturalists those who those who belong to the school of um the flow of Consciousness and improved the most gifted diviners of every movement of the human Spirit even those to the extent to which they commit themselves to some kind of objective description whether by a Eternal inspection or the most subtle intersection the most subtle insight into the inner movements of the spirit so long as they labor under the illusion that it is possible once and for all to write down to describe to give any finality to the kinds of process which they are trying to catch which they are trying to nail down so long as this goes on some attempt always to cage the uncageables they speak some attempt always to pursue some kind of Truth with the original truth to try and stop the unceasing flow to catch Movement by means of rest to catch Time by means of space to care for Life by means of Darkness that is the Romantic sermon and when they ask themselves how then one could begin to understand the energy in terms of the word understanding how one might obtain some kind of insight into this without positively distinguishing oneself on the one hand of the subject and distinguishing it as an object without the process killing it the answer which they thought to give at least some of them was that the only way of doing this was by means of myths by means of these symbols which I tried to speak last time because myths embody within themselves something you know inarticulable and also somehow managed to encapsulate the dark the irrational the inexpressible that which in some way conveys the Deep darkness of this whole process by images which themselves carry onto feather images in which themselves point in some Infinity direction that is the generate what the Germans who I think are responsible for this whole outlook in the end uh preached the Greeks for them understood life because Apollo and Dionysus were assembled there were myths who at one at the same time conveyed certain properties and yet if you ask yourself what it is that Apollo stands for what it is the Dionysus once they attempt to spell this out in a finite number of words or even think to find out number of pictures was plainly and absentity and therefore in some sense myths are at one at the same time images which the mind can contemplate in relative tranquility and yet also something which is Everlasting follows each generation transforms itself with the transformation of men and is it's in some sense in inexhaustible supply of the relevant images which are at once static and eternal but these images the Greek images are dead for us for we are not Greeks that much the notion of returning to Dionysus or returning to Odin is absurd therefore we must have modern myths for them we must create them and so there is a conscious process of Miss making and we get in the early 19th century all this conscientious and painful effort to construct myths perhaps not so painful perhaps some of it could be able to described as for genius the effort to construct myths which Shall Serve Us in the way in which the old myths serve the Greeks and the magic of Life rests on insoluble mystery and this is what the myths must somehow incorporate the Romantic art that his brother Friedrich is a Perpetual becoming without ever attaining of perfection nothing can come as depths it alone is infinite alone free its first law is the will of the Creator is the will of the Creator the will of the creator that knows no law is an attempt to evoke by symbols the inexpressible vision of the unfeasing activity which is life this is what I've attempted to convey now this is how Hamlet for example becomes the myth that is how Don Quixote becomes a myth that is how Faust becomes amazed what the Shakespeare would have said about the extraordinary literature accumulated around hebrids what Cervantes would have said about the extraordinary event surface but Quicks that it had from the early 19th century onwards I don't know but at any rate these things were converted into Rich sources of Mythology and if there are inventors knew nothing about it so much the better the Assumption was the author cannot know what dark Deputy plums Mozart cannot tell what genius it is it inspires him indeed so far as he can tell his dream was probably to that extent dried up and that I think if you wish for for a very Vivid illustration of the mythmaking capacity of the early 19th century which is really the heart of the Romantic Movement the attempt to break reality into fragments to get away from the structural things to say the unsayable and so on the history of the Opera Don Giovanni of Mercedes Don Giovanni is quite an apt illustration as everyone who has heard it knows the Opera ends or almost ends with the destruction of Don Germany by The Infernal forces after he failed to reform after he failed to repent fund died heard and he's swallowed up by the forces of Health at the end of which after he has been followed up in the Smoke on the stage was feared there is extent on the part of the remaining characters in the drama we then think of a very pretty little fixed about um how extended it is that Don Germany has been destroyed while they are alive and happy and proposed to seek a perfectly peaceful and contented and ordinary life in each in his own fashion is going to marry ISO in the 19th century this presently harmless fixed it was one of the Charming of Mozart's pieces was regarded by the public as blasphemous and was never never performed it was first reintroduced into the European repertures the father I know by Mala towards the end of the 19th or beginning of the 20th century and is now regularly played the reason is this here is this vast and in dominating Sinister symbolic figures on Giovanni who stands we know not for worst but certainly for something inexpressible he stands perhaps for art as against life he stands perhaps for some principle of inexhaustible evil against some kind of philistine God he stands for power he stands for magic he stands for some kind of infernal forces of a superhuman kind and the tragedy the Opera ends with an enormous climax in which one infernal force is swallowed by another and this vast melodrama Rises to a volcanic climax which is meant to power the audience and show them amidst what and and unstable about a terrifying World they live and then suddenly this Philistine little piece the success which follows in which the character simply peacefully think about the fact that a rake has been punished and good men will continue their life they are ordinary that's the peaceful life thereafter this was regarded as in artistic shallow pathetic and disgusting and therefore eliminated now this innovation of Don Germany into a vast myth which which must somehow be interpreted in a way to convey some kind of profoundest and most inexpressible aspects of the terrifying nature of reality it was certainly very far from the thoughts of the Liberties but probably very far from the thought of the Mozart the Liberties Lorenzo de Ponte who started life and as a convergence Drew in Venice and ended it I think as a music teacher in Philadelphia I was certainly a very remote from any thought of placed it up on the stage one of the great ones with vast symbols of spiritual existence on Earth but in the 19th century this was the attitude taken towards Don Germany and he continued to hold the minds of the 19th century haunted keptical guard's mind to a very profound degree and he haunted the minds of the 19th century and and indeed does so to the president until the present day this is very very typical example of the total reversal of values of the complete transformation of something which started off by being dry critical symmetrical and in every respect in the code with the conventions of the age it was something with the best its frame and suddenly begins to spread its wings in the most on the customs and and fearful fashion the this particular view of speak of of of great images dominating mankind of dark Forces the unconscious and the importance of the index festival and the necessity of discounting it and allowing for it spreads into every sphere of human activity it's by no means confined to art it certainly enters into other spheres it enters for example into politics first in a mild way inverts great images of the society Great Society of the dead and the living of those not yet born bound together by Myriad in the unanalyzable strands to which we are loyal so that every attempt to try to rationally analyze it say as a social contract or stay in some kind of utilitarian arrangement for the purpose of living a happier life or preventing collisions from human beings every such attempt is shallow and betrays the inner the inexpressible spirits dominate any human Association which carries it Forward loyalty to which spiritual immersion in which is at the very heart of true genuine deep devoted human life then mullah who was a German disciple of work and it very riches it's most eloquent form let me read it to him science says can only reproduce a lifeless state by stadium is a political state just cannot represent life no constagnation that is the social contract the liberal state is what he means the English state in particular North technician movement science utilitarianism the use of Machinery that does not convey the state that conveys a mere Factory an insurance company a Mercantile Society not the intimate Association of every physical and spiritual need of the whole of this physical and spiritual wealth of the totality of the internal and external life of a people into a great energetic infinitely active and living hell these mystical words then become the heart and center of the whole organic theory of political life and of loyalty to the state and of the state as a semi as a spiritual organization which in a sense is symbolic of the spiritual powers of divine mystery which is very nearly of the state Among The Romantics it is the extreme Romantics and that it becomes it enters the fear of law in the German School of historical jurisprudence the notion that true law is not that which a given person say a king or Fair assembly happens to pass which is simply an empirical event guided perhaps by utilitarian or other contemptible considerations it isn't that nor is it something Eternal those laws of nature those Divine laws but any rational Soul can discover for itself as thought today by the Roman church or as thought today by the stoics or as thought say by the 18th century French philosophers the name of this greed about what these laws were or how to discover them but they all agreed that there were certain Eternal immutable principles along which human life had to be founded adherence to which made men moral made men just and made men good this is denied law is the product of the beating Force within the nation of dark traditional forces of its organic step which flows through its body like a tree of something which we cannot identify and cannot analyze but with everyone who is true to his country feels coasting through his veins therefore law is a traditional growth law is something which half the circumstances were part of the Inner Cell of the nation now beginning to be conceived as almost individual that which between them they in some sense generate and therefore true law is traditional law every nation has its own law Every Nation had its own shape and this shape goes far into the Misty fast and its roots are somewhere in the darkness and unless it's roots in the darkness it is too easily overthrown the maestro who I think only half believed in this organic view of life in as much as theoretically at least he had to do he he was he was an adherent optimism the master says anything which man can make mankind ma anything which man can create man can destroy therefore the only thing which is eternal is this mysterious frightening process which goes on Far Below the level of Consciousness this is what creates traditions this is what create State Nations constitutions anything written anything articulated anything arrived it by sensible men in a cool hour is a thin superficial thing likely to collapse when other equally thin and equally superficial and equally reasonable men and refuted and this therefore has no true basis in reality this is also true of historical Theory certainly on the part of the Great German historical school which again tries to trace historical Evolution out of unconscious dark factors into interweaving with each other in all kinds of inexplicable ways there is even such thing as romantic economics in the form for example of the economics of men like fish stand of list particularly in Germany who believed in the necessity of say creating an isolated State an isolated state in which the true spiritual force of the nation it's a exercise itself without being buffeted by other nations that is to say well the purpose of the economics the purpose of money the purpose of trade is towards the spiritual self-perfection of man and does not obey so-called um unbreakable laws of Economics which even people like Burke believed Burke believed said indeed that the laws of Commerce are the laws of nature and therefore the laws of God and deduced from this that nothing can be done about passing any radical reform and the poor would have to starve this is approximately the consequence of this this was as you know um one of the consequences which led which which is a certain amount Justified this repute the Romantic economic and precise opposite of this all Economic Institutions must be bent towards some kind of ideal of living together in the spiritually Progressive manner and above all you mustn't make the mistake of supposing that there are external laws and there are some kind of objective given laws of Economics which in some way are Beyond human control this is a typical return to the real Natura this means once again you believe in the structure of things which can be studied which sits still while you look at it and describe it and this is false any such assumption so there are objective laws is simply a human sensitive a human invention an attempt on the part of human beings to justify their conduct and particularly their disreputable conduct by calling into being by stating the responsibility upon the shoulders of imaginary external laws such as the laws of supply and demand or in any other kind of external knows this law of politics that law of Economics which is alleged to be unalterable and which therefore in some way not only explains but justifies the poverty scholar and other unaffected social phenomena the Romantic from this respect could be either Progressive or reactionary in what might be called revolutionary States or radical States created after the French Revolution there were the actionary they called that for some kind of medieval darkness in reactional States say prasha after 1812 they became Progressive in as much as they regards of this artificial creation of the King of Prussia as a suffocating artificial mechanism which stifled the natural organic thrust of the life of the human beings imprisoned by it so it could take either form that is why we get revolutionary Romantics and reactional Romantics that's why that is why it's impossible to find Romanticism down to Any Given political view however often this has been tried this I think is the fundamental I think versus the fundamental um basis of Romanticism will and The Emptiness so to speak of outer space the fact that there is no structure to things that you can really Mill these things as you will they only come into being as a result of your building activity and therefore opposition to any view which tried to represent reality as having some kind of form which could be studied written down learned communicated to others and in other respects treated in a scientific manner there is no province in which I think this particular attitude is more evident than the field of music about which I have not yet spoken it's interesting and indeed even amusing to watch the development of attitudes World music from the beginning of the 18th to roughly speaking in the middle of the 19th century in the 18th century particularly in France music is regarded inferior art vocal music has its place because it heightens the importance of the words religious music has its place because it contributes to the mood which religion is meant to induce but it is clear for example towards the end of the 17th century says that it is obvious that the visual art is far more sensitive to the spiritual life of man than for example the Iraq Fontenelle who was the most civilized man of his time and indeed of most times said when instrumental music first began to invade France and sonatas began to occur as against the kind of vocal religious music on operatic music to which he was used which had a plot which had explanation which had some kind of extra musical importance when finances appeared he said Sonata what do you want of me and condemned instrumental music as a meaningless pattern of sounds not really suitable for delicate or civilizations the perhaps this is this is a fairly common attitude in France in Middle 30 in the middle of 18th century it comes out with particular vividness in the verses addressed by The Atheist and damages in the 70s um to the composer Duke who had this period conquered the Paris stage look as everyone knows reformed music by placing music above the world and by forcing the words so to speak into some Conformity with the true emotional drama which he wished to convey I mean the music he didn't um he the great musical reform of no longer using music as a mirror compliment to the meaning of the actual dramatic words this outre is about Montel who supposed drama and was supposed all art to have some kind of mimetic quality that is to say Imitation of Life imitation of the ideals of Life imitation of imaginary beings ideal beings not necessarily real beings but still some kind of imitation some kind of relationship to actual events actual person's actual emotions something which was there in reality which was the business of the artist it's necessary to idealize but at any way to represent as it truly is and music which had no meaning by itself which is simply it's exception of sounds was clearly non-mimetic everybody saw that words had something to do with the word spoken and ordinary life paints had something to do with colors perceived in nature but sounds were very dissimilar to the found heard in rusting forests or Auto or to Birdsong the kind of sounds which musicians use but clearly much remote from any kind of ordinary human experience than where the materials used by other artists hence looked in the following words they give you the English version first then I shall read the French he had arrived at Mountain Bank from Bohemia he has arrived preceded by his reputation upon the ruins of a superb poem he makes Achilles he makes Queen critical scream he makes the independable indefatigable Orchestra is this is a very typical um by no means uncharacteristic this is approximately the attitude of those who didn't wish to give up association with nature or the idea of imitation to The Peculiar notion of near expression of the Inner Cell this is true but Fontan writing in 1785. for him the only purpose of music is to evoke certain emotions unless it evokes some kind of emotions which are already there unless it is reminiscent of something unless it is in some sense associated with experience of some kind it has no value certainly sounds as such expressed nothing and need never be employed in this particular way Madame the style very typically already in the beginning of the 19th century speaking about music which is extremely fun said something this thought the value of music who lies in the following what man she says exhausted by a life of passion can listen with indifference to the tunes of his tranquil youth what woman whose Beauty time has at last ravaged can hear without emotion the song that her lover once sang well no doubt this is true but this is a very a very a very different type of approach to music from that which was already being expressed by the Romantic Germans of this particular period mathematical Harmony rather the sort of thing which people nowadays might be inclined to say about this is very different from bucking Rhoda who wrote in 1795 music shows us all the movements of our Spirits disembodied or of shopping who says the musician reveals to us the intimate essence of the world he is The Interpreter of the profoundest wisdom speaking a language which reason cannot understand now the reason Lord did anything else to speak that was sharpenhower's point because in some sense this music was the expression of the naked will of that internal energy which moves the world of debt inexpressible inner drive or will which in fact is the essence for him of reality and which all other Arts to some extent try to tame order arrange organize and to that extent catch into distort and kill and this of course is also the view of geek and of Schlagel and of all the romantics we indeed from the very frontal music and there are essays by Hoffman remarkable racism but also remarkable essays on the actual significance and Cosmic metaphysical significance let us say Albert tonic in the fifth which are described as Giles in glittering arms he also has a little essay on the true significance of for example the court of ASAP minor which is a very unlikely thing at that theory it will be written about by any member of any other European nation this then is 650 attitude towards music which is abstract detached from Life direct expression non-mimetic non-imminative and at the furthest possible end to any kind of objective description of anything nevertheless of course they didn't think that the Arts ought to be unrivaled they're going to Simply sing whatever comes to one's head paint whatever the mood charges want to paint or give absolutely um completely undisciplined um expression to the emotions they were child they've been charged in this by Professor Irving debit and others but mistakenly and he is bewildered and Confused gibberish results a poet must not wander idly all day in search of feelings and images he must certainly he must have been seeing his neighbor to his certainly he must allow these storms to rage for how indeed can fit can he avoid it but then he must discipline it then he must find the proper medium for that expression Schubert said that the mark of a great composer is caught in about Battle of inspiration in which the forces raves in the most uncontrolled way and then to keep one kid in the course of the storm and direct the troops this is the fall right there are far more genuine expression of what does it do then the remarks of the modern vital Romantics who I think were unaware of the nature about in as much as they were not artists themselves who were these persons who so celebrated the will who so hated the fixed nature of reality and who believed in these storms and these untameable these unbridgeable abysses and these unorganizable streams it's very difficult to give anything explanation although it ought to be done for the right of the Romantic Movement this cover is by looking at who these persons were particularly in Germany and the truth of course is that they were remarkably unworldly body of men they were poor they were timid they were bookish they were very awkward in society they were easily snubbed they had the service tutors to Great Men they were constantly full of insult and oppression it's clear that in some sense they were confined and contracted in their Universe they were like did Rose description of the Bent Twig which always always jumped back and hit its Bend as it speak and that is I think what is on the whole true of these Germans was something perhaps about Prussia where Muslim came from about this excessively paternalistic state of Frederick the greats about the fact that he was a mercantilist and therefore increased the wealth of Prussia increased her Army made her most powerful and Rich of all the German states but at the same time popularized her business and did not allow sufficient opportunity to most of our citizens it is true too that these men most of them sometimes children of clergymen and civil servants and the like received education which made of them gave them certain intellectual and emotional Ambitions which endure the fact that too many jobs were perhaps held by a person of good birth in Prussia where social distinct distinctions were preserved in the most rigorous manner because they weren't able to obtain full expression of their Ambitions did perhaps become somewhat frustrated and began to breed fantasies of every possible kind there is something in that at any rate it seems to me to be a more reasonable explanation that this should have been the case that men of a humiliated kind excited perhaps by the French Revolution and by the general overtime events should have given rise to this who thinks that the movement really began in France among ladies and is ready due to um the effects upon the nerves of the consumption of too much tea and coffee of corsets which were too tight of Cosmetics which were poisonous and of other means of self beautification which had a physical religious results this doesn't appear to me on the whole of the theory which is worth pursuing very much further attenuate attenuate the the movement Rose in Germany is arose in Germany and there it found its through its home but it traveled it traveled certainly beyond the confines of Germany it traveled to every country where there was some kind of social discontented dissatisfaction particularly if the country is oppressed by small Elites of brutal or oppressive or inefficient men particularly in Eastern Europe and it's found at home it perhaps it found its its most passionate expression of all in of all countries England where they are uncertainty was the leader of the entire Romantic Movement in the sense of baronism became almost synonymous with Romanticism in the early 19th century but there is no doubt that he is a person perhaps best described by Chateau Brio said the ancient cathly knew the secret anxiety the bitterness of strangled passions all fermenting uselessly a large political life gained in the gymnasium or in the fields of Mars The Business of the Forum public business filled our time and left no place for the falling and destructive anui of the heart that I think is certain condition and I think who is only perhaps half a romantic only a romantic in the sense that he was subjective and introspective and try to make a kind of vague myth out of Christian values to replace the no longer available myths of the ancient world of the Middle Ages which chateubriand seems to me to have described is half respectful and half ironical towards this movement perhaps the best expression of it it was given by a little French jingle which I should Now read you written by an anonymous prayer to the beginning of the 19th century classic is romantic the deviance is switched to the vile heart of the catech they always have someone as a model out of the law and artists must only listen to his own self and pride alone fills the Romantic hearts this is certainly the position of Baron in the emotional and indeed political world of the 19th century the baron Chief emphasis is upon the indomitable will and the whole philosophy of volunteerism the whole philosophy of the fact that there is a world which must be subdued and subjugated by Superior persons who really takes its right from him to the French Romantics from Hugo onwards are very in a certain sense Disciples of Baron Baron and gurja are the great names but go to a very ambiguous romantic and although in Faust he created somebody who keeps saying forward forward never stop never cease never ask the moment to wait over murder over crime over every conceivable obstacle the Romantic Spirit must Forge its way although gerges said that his later works and his rights denied it Baron acted his beliefs in the most convincing version let me read you typicalize the baron was really entered into European Consciousness and in a sentence it's infectious movement apart stoked in joyless revery with pleasure drugged he almost long for world and even for change of theme and he and the shame the shade by which means death there was in him a vital thorn of all he stood a stranger in this breeding world this is the typical note of the outcast the exile the Superman the man who cannot put up with the existing world because he sold it too large to contain it because he has ideals which in some sense presuppose the recessity of Perpetual servants movement forward which is constantly confined by the stupidity of the unimaginativeness and the flatness of the existing World therefore the career you it the lives of ironic figures begin in scorn pass into Vice from there to Crime to Terror into the staff that is an ordinary career of all these and laras and Canes who fill his virgin so much he sawed Beyond or sunk beneath the man with whom he felt condemning to breathe my spirit walks not through the fields of men this is Manfred nor looked upon the Earth which human eyes the thrust of their ambition was not mine the aim of their existence was not mine my Joys my griefs my passions and my Powers made me a stranger now the whole of the byronic syndrome so to speak consists in adhesion to these two propositions or rather two values which I tried to expand one of which is the will and the other which is the absence of a structure of the world to which one must in some sense make an adjustments and from Byron it passes to others from Victor you go to the French romantic to nodier to the French Romantics in general from them it goes further to shopping who sees man as being tossed in a kind of frail bark upon a vast ocean of the will which has no purpose which has no end which has no Direction which man can only resist at his Imperial but with which man can come to terms only if he's somehow manages to rid himself of this unnecessary desire to order unless they're desire to tidy himself up unnecessary to that to create a Cozy home for himself in this wild and in unpredictable element that is the only way in which you can do it from shop in her it goes to Wagner who again whose whole sermon in the ring for example is the upholding nature of unsatisfiable desire which must lead to the most fearful suffering and ultimately to the immolation in the most violent session of all those who exist but I desire which taken at one at the same time neither avoid nor satisfied and the result of which must be some kind of ultimate Extinction ultimate the Waters of the Rhine rise and cover this violence this chaotic this Unstoppable this incurable disease from which all Mortal by which all Mortals are affected that I think is the heart of the Romantic Movement in Europe now let me go back now and consider what again um what the position is with regard to that long catalog which I attempted to read during the first of these lectures in the course of which I tried to show that Romanticism appeared on the surface to say everything and it Opposite it appeared to me that if I'm right at all then perhaps it is possible to maintain that these two principles the necessity of the will and the absence of a structure of things may satisfy most of the strategies and the contradictions which appeared so stringent then are not perhaps quite surveillance as they may seem to appear to begin with if you begin for example with the notion of the fact that it's what Professor Lovejoy complains of Italy how can it be the word Romanticism stands at one of the same time for two such contradictory things as on the one hand Noble cabbages primitivism the simple life rosic peasants away from the frightful certification of the cities and towards smiling fairies of of of of of of them the United States um or some other simple form of life in some existence or non-existent part of the globe on the one hand that and on the other hand blue wigs green hair Upstate and um pulling his Lobster along the streets of Paris in order to attract to some degree of attention themselves which indeed to succeeded in doing the if you ask what is common to these do when Professor loves Roy quite naturally expresses a certain surprise that the same words should be comfortably used for those what is common to them both is that they both wish to break up the nature of the given in the 18th century you have a sophisticated form of life you have extreme extreme order of sophistication you have forms you have rules you have laws you have etiquette you have an extremely tight and well organized form of life whether in the Arts or in politics or in any other sphere anything which destroys this anything which blows it up is welcome and therefore whether you go to the Isle of the Blessed whether you go to the noble Indians whether you go to the simple uncorrupted heart of the simple man as sung by Russell on the one hand or whether you go to green wigs and blue wastegirls and then of biles the people with Miss extreme sophistication and heavier bohemianism of Life whichever of these will go to at any rate both these are methods of blowing up the given of shattering that which is given Justice in Hoffman this is the fact that brass knuckles become ill women or old women become City councilors or city councilors become build a punch is not simply meant to titillate your feelings not simply meant to be such a fantastic kind of story which which forgotten just as even in Google's famous Story the news the fact that I know detaches itself from the faith of a minor civil servant and then has romantic Adventures or very violent kind in the top hat in the great coach is not merely meant to be a rather peculiar story but he's somehow meant to be an invasion of an attack upon the Hideous nature of the unalterable given the fact that you wish to show them underneath this smooth surface that are frightful inexpressible forces boiling that and that's nothing can be taken for granted under the profound view of Life essentially entails the breaking of this mirror night surface so in the case of Romanticism whichever way you turn whether it is towards extreme sophistication or some unheard of Simplicity the results will be the same of course if you think that you actually can become a noble savage if you think that you actually can transform yourself into a simple native of some unsophisticated country living a very primitive life then the magic is gone but none of them did the whole point of the Romantic vision of the noble David's world that he was unattainable if he was attainable he was useless that is certainly true because when he becomes this or forgiven this faithful rule of life which is just as confining just as disciplining just as detestable as therefore it replaces and therefore the unfindable the unattainable the infinite and fearful these are the hearts of the matter similarly for example if you ask what is common to the enchanters and the Phantoms and the Griffins and the moats and the wrecking and the ghosts and the gibbering death which surround medieval castles and the ghosts of bloody hands and the fearful dark voices which reach through from um or all kinds of mysterious and terrifying Ravines and therefore what is the common to these and let us say the great spectacle of the peaceful organic Middle Ages with its tournaments Heralds and its priests and its Royal first aristocracy quiet dignified unalterable and essentially at peace with itself if you say was it common to build these and verses are of course stuck in trades romantic writers the answer is built these things if placed alongside the daily reality of a beginning of an early industrial civilization in Leo or in Birmingham in some sense compromise it let's say even Scott let us think throw it in the case of Scott here is the writer commonly account is romantic in a sense you may ask as they did a number of marxists puzzled marks its fittings do ask why it's called a romantic writer Scott is simply an extremely imaginative and scrupulous writer who managed to describe with considerable Fidelity in a way to affect all kinds of historians the life of age is preceding his own saying 70th Century Scotland say in the 13th century England say 15th century France and so forth why is this romantic well by itself it wouldn't be naturally it was simply a very um faithful scrupulous medieval historians simply describing the exact customs of your ancestors you are simply being a historian in the statistical tradition and you are simply telling the truth as well as they were able and this is in that sense the Romantic but from the country a highly reputable academic activity but Scott was a romantic writer why was this simply because he liked these forms of life that is not quite enough the point is that by painting these very attractive and delightful and hypnotic pictures of these ages he placed alongside our values by which I mean the values of 1810 the values of 1820 you the vandals of his own contemporary Scotland or even contemporary England or France which were what they were which were the values of the early 19th century by the side of these dungeons whatever they may have been Protestant on romantic industrial at any way not medieval by the side of these he placed another set of values equally good if not better in competition with these and this in some sense shattered the Monopoly shattered the possibility of the fact that every age is as good as it can be and is indeed advancing to an even better one if you ask the difference in Macaulay and Scott you will see it precisely in this but Macaulay really does believe in progress he believes everything fits into its own place and the 70th century was less fortunes and 18th and the 18th much less luckier than the 19th everything is all right where it is everything could be explained in terms of its own causal forces and we are progressing but at the same time if it were not for human stupidity human idleness human perversity and other Dark Forces festive interests and the likes we should be progressing much faster this he had in common to some degree with James Mill and the utilitarians he believed in bacon he did not believe in mystical religion that is playing now that is a picture whereby you say there is a reality it has a certain nature we studied we are scientific we know no more now than we used to know before they didn't know how to become happy we know better we don't do it perfectly but we know data and our answer to our descendants are made better still whether we ever get to the goal of a perfectly perfect societies stable unalterable with all human possible natural human wishes totally satisfied in the harmonious manner nobody can tell but it is not an absurd ideal this is the jigsaw puzzle solved if country is right it cannot be true this is like have there again if there are values in the past which are more valuable than those in the present or at least in competition with them if there is a magnificent civilization somewhere there in 13th century Britain or in some remote part of the world whether in space or in time which is as attractive if not more so than the grab civilization in which we're living but nevertheless and that is the important thing irreproducible you cannot get to it it can't be rebuilt it must remain a dream it must remain a fantasy it must remain an object of disappointment if you seek it if that is so then and it is impossible to solve the conclusion it's impossible to obtain a state of affairs which will contain the best of all these cultures because they're not compatible and therefore the notion of incompatibility or plurality of ideas Each of which has its own validity becomes part of the Great gattering realm which Romanticism implies against the notion of order against the notion of progress against the notion of perfection classical ideals the structure of things and so forth that is why Scott surprisingly enough is correctly called aromantic writer no Universal pattern no great style of which gidro spoke the real line the truth the the underground Traditions were to which Mr chairs wish to penetrate these are the things which are denied and denounced by the entire Romantic Movement from the beginning to the end as if a fearful delusion only likely to lead to stupidity and shallowness on the part of those who pursue it this is nature methodized this is tope's nature methodized this is Aristotle this is what the romantics most bitterly detested and therefore one must break up this order but let's break it up again to the past or by going within oneself and out of the external world over must go and seek to be one with some kind of great spiritual Drive which one will never completely identify oneself with or one must somehow idealize some myth which will never quite come to pass the Nordic myth or the Southern Miss or a Celtic myth or some other myth it doesn't matter which class or Nation or church or whatever it may be which will continue to drive you forward and which will never be fulfilled and the essence in Daniel which is that it is strictly unfulfillable so that if it were fulfilled it would be worthless that I think is the part and essence of the Romantic movements of Father you see Will and the life as not as as a man as an activity as something which cannot be described because it is perpetually creating you mustn't even say itself for the reason itself there is any movement that I think is the heart of the Romantic Movement now something perhaps ought to be said about its consequences a budget consequence is almost in the present day and it will certainly happen you return to a very vast degree but of course it was met by certain counter forces which to some extent softened the blow so there is no doubt whatever else may be said about Romanticism that he did put his finger to speak upon something which doesn't had left out upon these unconscious dark Forces upon the fact that the classical description of men and the description of men by scientists or scientifically influenced men such as foreign existence particularly the inward aspects of human life which were certainly left out and was never distorted the picture in the very violent degree one of the movements setting it which it led to in the present is the so-called existentialist movement in France but which I should like to say a few words for intentional it seems to me certainly the truth air of Romanticism before I speak of it let me explain what I think to be certain common qualities for the great achievement of Romanticism and that is with which I started my lectures was that unlike most other great movements in human history it literally succeeded in transforming certain of our values to a very profound degree that is what made existentialism possible let me first speak about these values in the natural attempt to show how it penetrates this modern philosophy and how it enters into certain other phenomena of Modern Life as well such as for example the emotive theory of ethics of fascism Each of which it is profoundly influenced I think I mentioned already but I think I was now put greater stress on the fact that a new cluster of Virtues appeared with the Romantic Movement since we are wills and since we are must be free in the country of 50 and cents motive can't see more than consequence for consequences cannot be controlled but motives can since we must be free and since we must be ourselves to the fullest possible degree the great virtue the greatest virtue of all Muslims is what existently it's called authenticity and what the romantics called sincerity now as I tried to say before this is new I don't believe that in the 17th century as I think I said to you if you had a religious conflict between say a Protestant and a Catholic it would have been possible for the Catholic to say the Protestant is a damnable heretic and Lead cells to Perdition but the fact that he is sincere raises him in my estimation the fact that he sincere that he's prepared to lay down his life for the nonsense in which he believes is a morally Noble fact and that anyone could speak who is sufficiently a man of integrity anyone who is prepared to sacrifice themselves upon any altar no matter what have the moral personality which is worthy of respect no matter how detestable or her false the ideals to which she about his need the notion of idealism as I say is new idealism means that you respect people for the fact that are prepared to give up health wealth popularity power all kinds of desirable things is not emotions demands which is that which they can't control themselves what can't call the external factors emotions which are themselves part of the psychological or physical world the people are prepared to lay their sides for the sake of something with which they truly identify themselves no matter what and the notion that idealism is a good thing and realism a bad one and that I think I said to you before if I say I am something of realness you now mean I'm about to tell a lie or do something peculiar that sense of realism is the result of Romantic Movement namely that sincerity becomes a virtue in itself and this I think instead of speaking at the heart of the whole thing the fact that there is admiration from the 1820s onwards for minorities as such for defiance and such for a failure as being nebula in certain respects and success for every kind of opposition to reality for so to speak which is called taking up positions on principle where the principal May itself be absurd that this in some way is not regarded with the kind of contempt with which will regards say a man who says twice 27 which is also a principle but which nevertheless you know to be the assertion of something false insignificant because what Romanticism did was to undermine the notion that he matters of value politics morals Aesthetics there are such things as objective criteria which operate between human beings such that anyone who doesn't use this criteria is simply either a liar or a Madman which is true say of mathematics or physics and this division between where objective truth obtains same mathematics same physics say in certain regions of Common Sense and where objective truth has been compromised say ethics say Aesthetics and so forth that I think is new and that I think has created a new attitude to life whether good or bad I will not volunteer to say that is to say if you ask yourself for example um what kind of moral evaluation you would give to a certain historical percentages I don't know let us say you compare um utilitarian persons who utilitarian figures have confess benefits and Mankind say phrases are great or or or or chemical let us say whom about whom you might think that our private characters were not Irreplaceable about whom we might say that they were perhaps in certain respects hard-hearted or brutal or cruel or were not at all free from sitting um impulses which on the whole human beings with the proof of at the same time there is no doubt they improve their lives of their peoples they were competent they were efficient they raised the level of Life they created great organizations which have lasted and they have been the source of a great deal of satisfaction strength and happiness to a large number of persons on the one hand these and if on the other hand you compare them with saying someone who obviously called suffering John of Leiden who caused cannibalism to occur in the city of Minister who caused a large number of people to be throated for the sake of his own apocalyptic religion who let us say destroyed a very large number of persons who today was considered innocent for the sake of ourselves for the purest possible motive supposing you ask yourself which of these persons you rate higher in the 18th century they would have been no doubt federing the great clearly comes above a religious metal today people would suffer from certain deaths they would suffer certain doubts because they think that idealism sincerity the education purity of heart purity of Mind are qualities preferable to corruption wickedness calculation mendacity the desert exploit other people for its own benefit which needs great state Founders undoubtedly we're guilty of and therefore we are in some sense children of Both Worlds The Peculiar art peculiar position is that we are able to Romanticism because Romanticism broke that great single mold in which Humanity in one way or another had marched the two the Philadelphia we are in some sense products of certain dance we can't quite tell we give so much so many remarks for consequence so many marks and motive and we oscillate between the two if it goes too far if someone is a is a Hitler then we don't think that he's sincerity isn't necessarily saving quality although in the searches it was much argued in his favor at the same time but this he must be very far indeed and flout values which are of an extremely Universal kind so that in some sense we are still members of some kind of unified tradition but the field within which we now oscillate freely the amount of allowance we make is far far greater than it has ever been before and for this the Romantic Movement is to Great degree responsible in as much as it preached the incompatibility of ideals the importance of motive the importance of character or at any rate of of specific of purpose over consequence over efficiency over effect over happiness success and um position in the world when heredolin said happiness happiness is not ideal happiness is tinted water on the tongue when Nietzsche said man does not desire happiness only the Englishman does this was a very this was a sentiment which on the hill would not have been lasted in the 17th or 18th centuries at least I think not and I think this is perhaps the direct product of the Romantic Movement now as to existentialism the Central Terminal of existentialism is essentially a romantic one namely that um there is in the world nothing to lean on if you try and explain your conduct and you say simply for tomorrow it's too strong for me emotion overcame me or there are certain principles of an objective kind which I give although I hate it I must observe or I have received order from an institution which is eternal or Divine or which is of an objectively valid character and although I may not like it it has given the order it's being laws of Economics it being um the ministry of the Interior it being whatever it may be it is given the orders and it has a right to my validity once you begin doing this you are simply using antibodies you are simply pretending that you are not deciding whether in fact you have decided but don't care to face the consequences of the fact that it is you who have decided even when you say I am partly unconscious I am the product of unconscious forces I cannot help it I have a complex it's not my fault I'm driven it is because my father was unkind to my mother that I am today the monster that I am this is wrongly speaking and I think it's probably right about this is being an attempt to carry Savor or to obtain Sympathy by transferring the weight of responsibility for your ex in which you are entirely free to something objective it doesn't matter whether it's the political organization or a psychological Doctrine somewhere you are trying to shift responsibility from your shoulders because of course it is you decided once you say you are a monster and there's nothing monster everything it's a kind of complacent acceptance of something which you know to be illegal but which of which will take the curse of off which will take a curse by saying not how Society is responsible we're all determined we cannot help it that is the causality which pervades the world and I am merely the instrument of powerful forces which I can no more prevent from making me evil and that can prevent making you good you are not to be congratulated being good nor am I condemned for being evil neither of us can help Our Fate we are simply fragments of an enormous cause of persons I think with a Certain Justice which is where it all comes from ultimately in saying that this is in some sense either self-deception or deliberate deception of others and this is of course go further than this they say that the very notion of a metaphysical structure of the universe theology or metaphysics they attempt to say that certain things have Essences which merely means things are what they are of necessity we arrive in a world which has a certain structure which covers the altered physical structure chemical structure social structure psychological structure and metaphysical and Theological structure with God at the head of the great creation and the amoeba below or whatever it is you may believe in these are nothing but pathetic attempts on the part of human beings to make themselves at home in the world by breeding enormous cozy sentences so that there's a world shall be touched and they shall be able to fit into it more comfortably and shall not have to think they are falling prospects of total responsibility for all that action from their own shoulders and when they give motives to doing what they do when they say I've done this because of that because in order to pursue this and you say but why should you pursue this particular end and you say because it is objectively right that too for the existentialist is again an attempt to transfer responsibility of what should be a free choice in a vacuum onto something which is not yours which is objective natural law the sayings of the figures the pronouncements of sacred books is he pronounced for the scientists in laboratory what psychologists and sociologists say what politicians or economists declare not I they and this is regarded as on the whole an attempt to shuffle off responsibility and to Blind oneself and blind oneself unnecessarily to the fact that the universe is in fact I can't avoid that is what is meant by calling it absurd I can't avoid would you and you alone exist and you make whatever there is to make and you are responsible for making what you make and you cannot plead extenuation all excuses are false and all explanations are explaining the way and this might as well be faced by a man who is brave enough and perfect enough to Face Reality as you should this is the steric sermon of existentialism and it derives directly from um from romanticism some Romantics of course went too far by which I mean this let me give you the extraordinary example of Sterner which I think Will May perhaps lead us to see what it is in the end that is valuable in Romanticism even for us now with the German hegelian Schoolmaster who argued quite correctly as follows The Romantics are quite right in supposing that when we think that institutions are Eternal this is a mistake institutions are created freely by human beings for the benefit of other human beings and in time become worn out and therefore by looking at them from the point of the presence we see that we'll announce when Mr polish them and have new institutions freely arrived at Bahrain indomitable will this is not nearly true of political institutions Economic Institutions or other public institutions it's equally true of doctrines can also be a most terrible weight Upon Us fearful chains and tyrannies which yoke us down to all kinds of those which the present or our own Wills no longer does iterate but if it is true and therefore theory is too much to blown up any kind of general theory say Hegel say Marx is itself a Gothic form of despotism which claims to have some kind of objective validity beyond the choice of individual men this cannot be right for it confines it and Crips us and limits our free activity but if this is true about doctrines it will be equilateral of all General propositions but if it is true of all General propositions then and this is the last step of all which some romantic session so it's true of all words because all words are General they're all catified if I use the word yellow I want to mean by it what I meant by it yesterday and what you will mean by tomorrow and this of course is a terrible joke this is a fearful despotism right sure the word yellow means the same thing now and tomorrow why can't I alter it why is it twice to always make four why should Words Be uniform why can't I make up my own Universe each time as I begin but response if I do that then if there is no systematic symbolism I can't think and if I can't think I get mad and to do him Justice did during the remains very honorable and very consistently in The Lunatic Asylum somewhere in the middle 60s but something the thought was also boiling in the might of nature with the far superior thinker but who in certain respects resemblesh and from this I think a model may be drawn namely but so long as we live in society we we communicate those with whom we if we did not communicate we should hardly be men among the definitions of what we mean by human being is someone who understands the attenuated portion of what we say to him to this degree then there must be some degree of common common values common language common communication and some degree of common values otherwise there will be no intelligibility between human beings but the human being cannot understand what any other human being says is just a human being he's on the whole pronounced abnormal to the extent to which there is normality the risk and there is communication there are common values to the extent to which there are common values it is impossible to say everything must be created by me if I find something given smash it if I find something structured destroyed in order to give free play to my unbridled imagination and to this extent remember if it's driven to its logical conclusion does certainly end in some kind of lunacy in a certain sense fascism too is an inheritor of Romanticism and that is inherited not because it is irrational plenty of movement's been there all because we believe in Elites plenty of movements have been that the reason why fascism owes them into Romanticism is again because of this notion of the unpredictable will either of a man or of a group which forges forward in some impossible to organize impossible to predict impossible to rationalize fashion that is the whole heart to speak in a certain sense of fascism that is the whole heart the wholehearted person was what the leader will say tomorrow how the spirit will move us where we shall go what we should do that cannot be foretold the hysterical element the historical self-assertion and the nihilistic destruction of existing institutions because they can find the unlimited will which is the only thing which counts for human beings the superior person who crushes the inferior because it's really stronger death is direct inheritance and extremely distorted are still an inheritance from these Romantics of whom I have been speaking and this certainly has played an extremely powerful part in our lives the whole thing indeed is an attempt to impose an aesthetic model upon reality to say everything should obey the rules about if you are an artist then perhaps some of these propositions which I've tried to utter during the last six lectures have a great deal of validity they attempt to convert life into art presupposes that human beings are tough the principles they are simple in some sense material even the things or sounds are material and to the degree to which this is not true to the degree to which human beings in order to communicate with each other are forced to recognize certain common values are forced to recognize certain common facts are forced to live in a common world to the extent to which not everything which science says is is nonsense not everything which Common Sense declares is untrue because to say that is in itself it sounds contradictory and absurd proposition to this extent Romanticism in its full form and even its owns in the form of both existentialism and the fascism seem to me to be fallacious let me end on one further note what may we can be said we owe to Romanticism well we are a great deal to it we owe the notion of the freedom of the artist and the fact that he neither he nor human beings in general can be explained by oversimplified rules such as the prevalent in the 18th century and first of the still enunciated by over-rational and over-scientific analysts of other human beings or groups is also the notion that a unified answer to human Affairs is likely to be ruinous that if human beings if you really believe that there is one single solution to all human ills and this solution you must impose and no matter what cost you are likely to become a violent and the static tyrant in the name of your solution because your desire to remove all obstacles to it will end by destroying those creatures for whose benefits you you offer the solution the notion that there are many values that are incompatible the whole notion of plurality the whole notion of inexhaustibility the whole notion of the specific in some sense imperfection of all human answers and Arrangements the notion that no single answer which claims to be perfect and true whether or not or in life can in principle be perfect for true that I think we certainly owe the romantics and so around the Cure that situation of the Rhythm here are the romantics whose Chief burden is to destroy ordinary tolerance to destroy Philistines to destroy common sense to destroy peaceful evocations of men to raise everybody to some passionate level of self-expressive experience of such a kind as perhaps any divinities in the older works of men were supposed to exercise this is the ostensible um sermon the ostensible purpose of Romanticism whether among the Germans or whom I speak or in Baron or among the French or whoever it may be this is and yet as a result of making clear the existence of perennial values by the result of driving wedges into the notion of the classical idea of the single answer to all questions of the rationalizability of everything of the answerability of all questions of the whole jigsaw puzzle conception of Life by doing this they have as it were put forward prominently laid emphasis upon the incompatibility of human ideals and if these ideas are incompatible then human beings sooner or later realize that they must make do they must make compromises because if they seek to destroy other others will seek to destroy them with the result that as a result of this passionate fanatical Doctrine we have appreciation of the necessity of collaborating others the necessity of preserving an imperfect equilibrium in human Affairs the impossibility of driving human beings so far into the pin which we have created for them or into the single solution which possesses us that they will ultimately revolt against us or at any rate be crushed by it so the result of Romanticism is liberalism Toleration decency and the appreciation of the imperfections of life some degree of increased if you like rational self-understanding this certainly was very very far from the intentions of Romanticism but at the same time so far as romantic Doctrine is true they are the persons who most strongly emphasize the unpredictability of all human activities and in their own particular case that hoist to their impetaz aiming if one thing they produced fortunate for us all almost the exact opposite thank you very much I'm very grateful to you for having her the patience to listen to these six long details [Applause] questions
