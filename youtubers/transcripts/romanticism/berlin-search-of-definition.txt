TRANSCRIPT:

[Applause] ladies and gentlemen i want to begin by thanking the trustees of the national gallery and in particular mr walker for saying kind things about me and for giving me much more than i do it's infinite more agreeable to receive more money than one's due that i can assure you of and indeed in being asked to deliver these lectures i receive more than my due for so far as i can gather these lectures are primarily intended for genuine experts on the arts art historians and experts on aesthetics amongst whom i cannot possibly count myself it is therefore a particular generosity on their part to have invited me my only valid excuse for talking about this subject is that the romantic movement naturally is relevant to the arts the arts even though i know not very much about them cannot be altogether kept out and i promise not to keep them out beyond measure the second reason why i can claim some qualification for talking about this subject is that i propose to deal with political and social and moral life as well and it is true i think to say of the romantic movement that it is not only a movement in which the arts are concerned not only an artistic movement but perhaps the first moment certainly in the history of the west when the arts dominated other aspects of life when there was a kind of tyranny of art over life which in some sense is the essence of the romantic movement at least i propose to try and demonstrate that this is so certainly the interest in romanticism is not simply a historical historical one a great many movements of the present day nationalism existentialism admiration for great men admiration for impersonal institutions democracy totalitarianism all these things are profoundly affected by the rise of romanticism which enters them all and that is why it is a subject not all together irrelevant even to our own day perhaps you would expect me to begin or at least to attempt to begin with some kind of definition of romanticism or at least some generalization in order to say what it is that i mean by it i don't propose to walk into that particular trap the imminent and wise professor northrop frye points out that whenever anyone embarks on a generalization on the subject of romanticism even something so innocuous for example has to say that a new attitude is sprang up among english periods towards nature let us say wordsworth in coleridge as against say dryden and pope somebody will always be found who will produce countervailing evidence from the writings of houma kalidasa pre-muslim arabian epics medieval spanish verse and finally dryden and pope themselves and for this reason i don't propose to generalize i propose if i may simply to convey in some other way what it is that i think romanticism to be indeed the literature on romanticism is larger than romanticism itself and the literature defining what it is of the literature romanticism is concerned with is quite large in turn it's a kind of inverted pyramid the dangerous and confused subject in which many have lost i won't say there are senses but it anyway that sense of direction it's like one of the it's that like the dark cave described i think by virgil where all the footsteps leave it in one direction the cave of polyphemus those who enter it are never seen to emerge again it is therefore with some trepidation that i embark upon the subject let me begin by saying that i think that the importance of romanticism is that it is the largest recent movement which transformed the lives and the thought of the western world it seems to me to be the greatest single shift in the consciousness of the west that has occurred and all the other shifts which have occurred in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries appear to me comparably less important and anyway deeply influenced by it the history of not only thought but consciousness opinion action to morals politics aesthetics is to a large degree a history of dominant models let me try and explain what i mean always whenever you look at any particular civilization i think you will find that its most characteristic writings are dominated by a particular pattern of life which those who engage in these writings or paint these paintings or produce these particular music works of pieces of music in some sense are dominated by and in order to identify civilization in order to explain what kind of civilization it is in order to understand the world in which men of this sort thought and felt and acted it is i think of importance to try so far as possible to isolate the dominant pattern which that culture obeys let me try to explain this by examples for instance if you read greek philosophy or greek literature of the classical age you will find for example in the case of say the philosophy of plato that he is dominated by a geometrical or mathematical model it is clear that his thought operates on lines which are in some way conditioned by the thought that there are certain axiomatic truths adamantine unbreakable from which it is possible by severe logic to deduce certain absolutely infallible conclusions that it is possible to attain to this kind of absolute wisdom by a special method which he recommends that there is such a thing as absolute knowledge to be obtained in the world and if only we can attain to this absolute knowledge of which geometry and mathematics in general is the nearest example the most perfect paradigm if only we can do that we can organize our lives in terms of this knowledge in terms of these truths once and for all in a static manner needing no further change and then all suffering all doubt all ignorance all forms of human vice and folly can be expected to disappear from the earth and this notion that there is somewhere a perfect vision and it needs only a certain kind of severe discipline or a certain kind of method to attain to this truth which is analogous at any rate to the cold and isolated truths of mathematics this vision then affects a great many other thinkers in the post-patronic age certainly the renaissance which have similar ideas certainly thinkers like spinoza thinkers in the 18th century think of the 19th century too who believed it possible to attain to some kind of if not absolute attenuate nearly absolute knowledge and in terms of this to tidy the world up to create some kind of rational order in which vice and stupidity which of course so much destruction in the past can at last be avoided by the use of carefully acquired information and the application to it of universally intelligible reasons something of that kind now this is one way of one kind of model somebody simply offer it as an example these models invariably begin by liberating people from error from confusion from some kind of unintelligible world which they seek to explain to themselves by means of a model but they almost invariably end by enslaving those very same men by failing to explain the whole experience by beginning as liberators and ending as in some sort of despotism take for example a parallel culture that of the bible that is the jews at a comparable period you will find a totally different model dominating a totally different set of ideas which would have been unintelligible to the greeks the notion certainly from which judaism and christianity to large degrees praying is the notion of family life the relations of father and son perhaps the relations of members of a tribe to one another such fundamental relationships in terms of which nature and life are explained as the love of children for their father the brotherhood of man forgiveness atonement commands issued by superior to inferior the sense of duty transgression sin and therefore the need to attend for it this whole complex of qualities in terms of which the whole the universe is explained by those who created the bible and by those who are to a large extent influenced by it is something which would be totally unintelligible greeks let me read you a perfectly and you will see what it says i mean for instance when the psalmist says that the presence of the lord the sea saw and fled jordan was driven back the mountains skipped like rams the hills skipped like young lambs the earth tremble is ordered to tremble in the presence of the lord this would have been particularly unintelligible to blatant aristotle because the whole notion obviously it's because of a world which is in some sense reacts personally to the orders of the lord that all relationships with animal inanimate must in some way be interpreted in terms of the relations of human beings or attenuate generations of personalities in one case divine in the other case human is very remote from the greek conception of what a god was and what his relations were to mankind hence the absence among the greeks of the notion of obligation hence the absence among the greeks of the notion of duty which it is so difficult for people who read the greeks through the spectacles partly affected by the jews to grasp let me try and convey to you how strange different models can be because this is important in simply tracing the history of these transformations of consciousness in what i wish to convey is that considerable revolutions have occurred in the general outlook of mankind which is sometimes difficult to retrace because we swallow them as if they were familiar zika was perhaps the italian thinker who flourished at the beginning of the 18th century if a man who was totally poor and neglected may be set to vika is the man who i suppose drew our attention to the strangeness of these ancient cultures he points out for example that in the familiar line omnia planar yavis everything is full of drove which is a perfect familiar let latin half line something to us not only unintelligible he said on the one hand jupiter or dove is a large bearded divinity who has thunder lightning on the other hand in some sense the entire um everything omnia is said to be full of this bearded being which is not on the face of it intelligible and he then argues with great imagination and with great confidence here that somehow the view of these ancient peoples remote from us must have been very different for ours for them to have been able to conceive of their divinity both as a bearded giant commanding the gods and men and on the other hand as something of which the whole heavens could be full let me give you a more familiar example when aristotle for example in the nike mechanics discusses the subject of friendship he says rather to us in some surprising manner that there are various kinds of friends for example there is friendship which consists in passionate infatuation by one human being with another and there is also a friendship which consists in business relationship in trading in buying and selling the fact that for aristotle there is nothing strange in saying there are two kinds of friends there are people whose whole lives that give a given or indicate whose emotions are passionately engaged in love and on the other hand of course there are people who sell shoes to one another and these are species of the same genus it's something which as a result perhaps of christianity or of the romantic movement or whatever it may be we find it rather difficult to automatize ourselves too i merely give you these examples in order to convey to that these ancient cultures are stranger than we think and that larger transformations have occurred in the history of human consciousness than the ordinary and critical reading of the classics would seem to convey there are great many other examples which i shall not trouble you there is of course i mean the world can be conceived organically like a tree in which every part lives for every other part and through every other part and again mechanistically as a result of say some scientific model in which the parts are external to one another and in which for example say the state or any other human institution is regarded as a gadget for the purpose of promoting happiness or preventing people from doing each other in these are very different conceptions of life and they do belong to different climates of opinion and are influenced by different considerations what as a rule happens is that some subject gains the ascendancy say physics or say chemistry and as a result of the enormous hole which it has upon the imagination of this generation it is applied in other spheres as well this happened to sociology in the 19th century it happened to psychology in our own now my thesis is that the romantic movement in some sense was just such a gigantic and radical transformation after which nothing was ever the same and this is the subject which i really want to address myself where did the romantic movement take his rise before i even say what it is certainly not in england although technically no doubt it did that is all the historians the thoughts will tell you at any rate that is not where it occurred in its most dramatic form the question arises when i speak romanticism do i mean something which happens historically as i appear to be saying or is it perhaps a permanent frame of mind which isn't exclusive isn't monopolized by any particular age two of my eminent predecessors sir herbert reed and kenneth clark both melon lecturers have taken up the position that romanticism is a permanent state of mind which might be found anywhere so kenneth clark finds it i think in some lines of hadrons so herbert reed creates a very great many examples the baron sierra who has written extensively on this subject quotes plato and pratignus and the greek novelist heliodorus and a great many other persons who who in his opinion were romantic writers i don't wish to end up on this issue it may be so but the subject of which i wish to deal is confined in time i don't wish to deal with a permanent human attitude but with a particular transformation which historically occurred and affects us and therefore i propose to confine my attention to what occurred in the second third of the 18th century it occurred not in england it occurred not in france it occurred for the most part in germany the common view of history and historical change is that we begin with a french dvtm an elegant century in which everything begins by being calm and smooth rules that are made both in life and in art there is a general advance of reason rationality is progressing the church is retreating and reason is yielding to the great attacks upon it of the french philosoph there is peace there is calm there is elegant building there is a belief in universal reason applying both human affairs and to artistic practice to morals to politics to philosophy and then there is a sudden apparent unaccountable invasion suddenly there is a violent eruption of emotion enthusiasm people become interested in gothic buildings in introspection people suddenly become neurotic and melancholy they begin to admire the uncountable flights of spontaneous genius there is a general retreat from this symmetrical elegant glassy state of affairs at the same time other changes occur too a french great revolution breaks out there is this content a revolution breaks out the king has his head cut off the terror begins it's not quite clear what these two revolutions have to do with each other as we read history on the whole there is a general sense that something catastrophic occurred towards the end of the 18th century at first things appeared to go comparatively smoothly then there was a sudden breakthrough some welcome it some denounce it those who denounce it suppose that this age to have been an illegal and peaceful age those who didn't know it didn't know the truth dusseld de la vie as talia said others on the other hand say it was artificial and hypocritical age and the revolution ushered in a reign of greater justice greater humanity greater freedom greater understanding of man for man well that's as may be the question is what is the relation of the so-called romantic revolution the sudden breakthrough as it were in what might be called the realms of altar of morals of this new and and turbulent attitude and the revolution which is normally known as the french revolution were the people who danced upon the ruins of the bastille were the people who cut off the head of louis in the 16th were these the same persons as those who were affected by the sudden cult of genius or the sudden breakthrough of emotionalism of which were told or the sudden disturbance and turbulence which suddenly flood the western world apparently not certainly the principles in the in the name of which the french revolution was fought were principles of universal reason of order of justice not at all connected with the sense of uniqueness this profound emotional introspection the sense of the differences of things the dissimilarities rather than similarities with which the romantic movement is usually associated at this point someone will say what about rousseau well rousseau of course in a sense is quite correctly attributed to the romantic movement as one of its fathers but the rousseau who is responsible for the ideas of robespierre the russo who is responsible for the ideas of the french jacobins is not the russo it seems to me who has obvious connection with romanticism that rule so is rousseau who wrote the social contract which is a classical treatise typically classical treatise which speaks of the return of man to original those primary principles which all men have in common the reign of universal reason which unites men as opposed to emotions which divide him the reign of universal justice and universal peace as against the conflicts and the turbulence and the disturbances which on the whole tear human hearts from the minds and divide men against themselves so that it's difficult to see what is the relation of this great romantic upheaval to the political revolution and then there is the industrial revolution too which cannot be regarded as irrelevant after all ideas don't breed ideas some social and economic factors are surely responsible for great upheavals in the human consciousness so we have in our hands a problem there is the industrial revolution there is a great french political revolution under classical auspices and there is a romantic revolution even if we look at the arts if you look at the the great art of the french revolution for example the great revolutionary paintings of david it's difficult to connect him specifically with the romantic revolution the paintings of david have a kind of austere eloquence the austere jacobin eloquence of a return to spartans return to romans something a protest against the frivolity and the superficiality of life which is connected with the preachings of such men as machiavelli or savarola or mabli people who denounced the frivolity of that age in the name of eternal ideals of universal kind whereas the romantic movement were telled by all these historians was a passionate protest against universality of any kind and therefore there is prima facie attenuate a problem to understand what happened in order to give you some sense of what it is that i regard as being this great breakthrough why i think that in those years say 1760 to 1830 something transforming occurred there was a great break in the european consciousness in order to give you attenuate some preliminary evidence of why i think there is even a case for this let me give you an example of what i mean supposing you were traveling about western europe say in the 1820s and supposing in france you spoke to the avant-garde young men who are friends of victor hugo the hugo and supposing you went to germany and spoke there to the people who had once been visited by madame de stahl who had interpreted the german soul to the french supposing you had met the schlegel brothers who were great theories of romanticism or let's just say the people one or two of the friends of goethe in weimar the fabulous and poet teak other persons connect with the romantic movement and their followers in the universities students young men painters sculptors were deeply influenced by the work of these poets and these dramatists in these critics and supposing in england you had spoken to someone who'd been influenced say by kill ridge and above all by barrel anyone enters by baron whether in england or france or italy or beyond the rain or beyond the elb suppose you would spoke to these persons you would have found that their ideal of life was approximately of this kind that the values to which they attach the highest importance are such values as dedication to an ideal integrity sincerity readiness to sacrifice one's life to some inner light to some ideal for which it is worth sacrificing all that one is for which it is worth both living and dying you would have found that they were not primarily interested say in knowledge say in the advances of science not interested in political power not interested in happiness not interested above all in adjustment to life in finding your place in society in living at peace with your government in even in loyalty perhaps to your king or to your republic you would have found that common sense moderation was very far from their thoughts you would have found that what they believed in was the necessity of fighting for whatever you believed in to the last breath in your body and you would have found that there were persons on the whole believed in the value of martyrdom as such no matter what the martyrdom was mahadam for you would have found that they believed that minorities were in some way more holy majorities that failure was in a certain sense nobler than success which had certainly something shoddy and something vulgar about it you would have found the very notion of idealism which is not in this philosophical sense but in the ordinary sense which we use it idealism that is to say the state of mind of a man who is prepared to sacrifice a great deal for principle or for some conviction who is not prepared to sell out who is prepared to go to the stake for something which he believes because he believes in it this attitude was relatively new and what people admired was wholeheartedness sincerity purity of soul ability and readiness to dedicate yourself for your ideal no matter what it was no matter what it was that is the important phrase which i wish to use supposing in the 16th century say you had a conversation with somebody engaged in the great religious wars which tore europe apart as that period and supposing you said to let us say a catholic of that period engaged in hostilities supposing you said of course these protestants believe what is false of course to believe what they believe is to court perdition of course they are dangerous to the salvation of human cells and which there is nothing more important but they are so sincere they die so regularly for their cause that integrity is so splendid one must yield a certain meat evaluation for the moral dignity and sublimity of people who are prepared to do that such a sentiment would have been unintelligible anyone who really knew supposed themselves to know the truth say a catholic who believed in the truths preached to him by the church would have known that persons able to put the whole of themselves into the theory and practice of falsehood were simply dangerous persons and the more sincere they were the more dangerous more mad in a sense no christian knight would have supposed when he fought against a muslim that he was expected to admire the purity and the sincerity with which the pain him believed in their absurd doctrines no doubt if you were a decent person and you killed a brave enemy you could you didn't oblige to spit upon his corpse you um took the line that it was pity that so much courage which was universally admired quality so much courage so much ability so much devotion should have gone to a cause so palpably absurd or dangerous but certainly you wouldn't have said it matters little what these people believe what matters is a state of mind which they believe it what matters is that they didn't sell out they were made of integrity these are people i can respect if they come over to our side simply in order to save themselves that would have been a very self-seeking a very prudent a very contemptible form of action this is a state of mind which people would say if i believe one thing and you believe another then it is important that we should fight each other perhaps it is good that you should kill me or that i should kill you perhaps in a duel it is best to kill each other but the worst of all possible things is compromise because that means we have both betrayed the ideal which is within us now martyrdom was always of course admired but martin of the truth christians admired martyrs because they were witnesses to the truth if they were witnesses to falsehood there was nothing admirable about them perhaps something repeated certainly nothing to be admired by the time you get to the 1820s the period which i speak you certainly get a frame of mind in which the state of mind the motive is more important than the consequence the intention is more important than the effect the purity of heart integrity devotion dedication all these things which we ourselves admire without much difficulty which is entertaining into the very texture of our normal model attitudes became more or less commonplace first among minorities gradually they spread out let me give you an example of what i mean by shift take for example voltaire's play uh on muhammad well well that was not particularly interesting mohammed and the player muhammad was rarely intended no doubt as an attack upon the church nevertheless muhammad in voltaire's play emerges as a superstitious cruel and fanatical monster who crushes all efforts at freedom and justice and reason and is therefore to be denounced as an enemy of all the voltaire held most important toleration justice truth civilization and then consider what for example nasa very much later carlisle has to say on the subject who in a sense is highly characteristic if someone exaggerated representative of the romantic movement he is described by carlisle in the course of the book called here's hero worship in the course of which great many heroes are enumerated and analyzed mohammed is described as a fiery massive life cast up from the great bosom of nature herself he's a man of blazing sincerity and power and therefore to be admired and what he is compared to what is not liked is the 18th century which is withered and useless the 18th century which to carlyle as as he calls it is a warped and second great century the point of muhammad is that carlyle is not the least interested in the truth of the quran he doesn't begin to suppose the quran does contain anything which he carlisle could be expected to believe but what he admires mohammed for is that he's an elemental force that he lives an intense life that he has a great many followers with him that something elemental occurred that in some way a tremendous phenomenon occurred there was a great movement it it's a great and moving episode in the life of mankind which muhammad in some way instantiates and the importance of muhammad is his character and not his beliefs the question whether muhammad believed this true or false would appear to carlyle perfectly irrelevant he says in the course of the same essays dante's sublime catholicism had to be torn asunder by luther shakespeare's noble feudalism has to end in the french revolution why does why do they have to do this because it doesn't matter whether dante's noble catholicism or sublime catholicism is there is not true the point is it's a great movement it has lasted its time and now something equally powerful equally earnest equally sincere equally deep equally earth shaking must take its place the importance of the french revolution is that it made a great dent upon the consciousness of mankind that the men who made the french revolution were deeply and earnest and not simply smiling hypocrites as he thought voltaire to be now this is an attitude which i think is i won't say brand new because it's too dangerous to say that but at any rate sufficiently knew to be worthy of attention and whatever it was that caused it occurred it seems to me somewhere within the year 1760 in 1830 and it began in germany then and grew a base the important thing now is to consider what kinds of effects this kind of development head again i don't wish to enumerate this because i proposed to deal with the details of it in forthcoming lectures but take another example of the sort of things i mean the attitude for example was tragedy broadly speaking previous generations assumed the tragedy was always due to some kind of error someone got something wrong so to speak someone made a mistake either it was moral error or it was intellectual error it might have been avoidable or it might be unavoidable greek tragedy was era which the gods sent upon you which no man subject to them could perhaps avoid it but in principle if these men had been omniscient they would not have committed those grave errors which they did commit and that would not have brought misfortunes upon themselves if was it known that lions was his father he wouldn't have murdered him this is true even of the tragedies of shakespeare to certain degree if othello had known that desdemona was innocent none of the normal of that particular tragedy could have occurred and therefore the tragedy is founded upon if you like the inevitable or perhaps avoidable lack of something in men knowledge skill ability to live moral courage ability to do the right thing when you see it or whatever it may be better men morally stronger intellectually more adept above all omniscient persons who perhaps also had enough power could always avoid that which in fact is the substance of tension this is not so for the early 19th century even for the late 18th if you read schiller's tragedy of the robbers which i shall have to return again you will find that karl moore the hearer of that the hero villain of that is a man who avenges himself upon a detestable society by becoming a brigand and committing a number of atrocious murders he is punished for it in the end but if you ask who is to blame is it the society which is which he comes are its values totally corrupt or are his values totally insane which of the two sides is right certainly there is no answer to be obtained in that tragedy and the very question would appear to shilla shallow and in some sense blind here there is a collision perhaps an unavoidable collision between sets of values which are literally incompatible previous generations supposed that all good things could in some way be reconciled this is true no longer if you read business tragedy the death of danton in which robespierre finally causes the death of danton de muller in the course of the revolution and you ask was robespierre wrong to do this no the tragedy is such that danto although he was a sincere revolutionary who committed certain errors didn't deserve to die and robert's pair was perfectly right to putting him to death in some sense you have a collision here of what hegel afterwards called good with good it isn't due to error it's due to some kind of collision or conflict of an unavoidable kind of loose elements wondering about the earth in some way of values which couldn't in some sense be reconciled and what matters is that people should dedicate themselves to these values with all that is in them if they do that they are suitable heroes for tragedy if they do not do that then they are philistines then they are members of the bourgeoisie then they are no good and not worth writing about the figure who in some sense dominates that particular century as an image is the spousal figure of beethoven in his garrett beethoven is a man who does what is in him he is poor he's ignorant he's bullish his manners are bad he knows little and he's perhaps not a very interesting figure outside the inspiration which drives him forward but the point about him is that he is not settled out he sits in his garrett and he creates he creates in accordance with the light which is within him and that is all that a man should do this is what makes a man a hero even if beethoven is not a genius even if like the hero of balzac's le chadov masterpiece he is mad and covers his canvas with paints so in the end there is nothing intelligible at all just a fearful confusion of unintelligible irrational paint even then this figure is worthy of more than pity he's in some sense a man who has dedicated himself to an ideal who has thrown away the world who is in some sense represents the most heroic the most of sacrificing the most splendid qualities which a human being can have when gautier in the famous introduction to mother you know i think 1835 defending the notion of sake says fools cretins this is addressed to the critics in general the public too fools cretins you cannot make soup out of a book a novel is not a pair of books a sonnet is not a syringe a drama is not a railway a thousand times no no a thousand times no gautee's point is that the old defense of art quite apart from the particular school of um social utility which is attacking sensimon the utilitarians who detect the object of attack and the socialists apart from these the notion that the purpose of art for example is to give pleasure to a large number of persons or even to a small number of carefully trained kanoshenti is not true the purpose of art is to produce beauty and if only the artist alone perceives that his object is beautiful that is a sufficient end to life clearly something occurred to have shifted consciousness to this degree to have shifted it away from the notion of the universal truths universal canons of art that in some sense all human activities were meant to terminate in getting things right and the criteria of getting things right but in some way public in some way demonstrable all intelligent men by applying their intellects who discover them has shifted from that to a totally different attitude towards life interaction something clearly occurred we ask what we are told that again that there was a great turn towards emotionalism that there was a sudden interest in the primitive and the remote the remote in time and emerging place that there was an outbreak of craving for the infinite something he said about immersion recollected and tranquility something is said but it's not clear what this has to do with any of the things which i've just mentioned with scott's novels schubert's songs delacroix the rise of state worship and german defense or german propaganda in favor of economic self-sufficiency also something to do with superhuman qualities admiration of wild genius outlaws heroes aestheticism self-destruction what have all these things in common if we try and discover a somewhat startling prospect greets our view let me offer you some definitions of romanticism which i've attempted to cull from the writings of some of the most imminent persons who have written on the subject and you will see that the subject is by no means easy standalone says the romantic is the modern and interesting classicism is the old and the dull it isn't quite perhaps as simple as it sounds what he means is that romanticism means understanding that the forces which move in your own life as opposed to some escape towards something which is obsolete however what he actually says in the book on gracie and shakespeare is that which i've just enunciated namely the modern and the interesting whereas classicism is the old and the doubt but gertrude says romanticism is disease it is the weak the sickly the battlecry was school of wild birds and catholic reactions whereas classicism is strong fresh gay sound like homer and the song of the nebulas nietzsche says it is not a disease but a therapy a cure for the disease this monday who was swiss critic of considerable imagination though not perhaps altogether friendly to romanticism in spite of being a friend of mine understand sis monday says that romanticism is a union of love religion and chivalry but gents who was metanique's chief agent at this time and a precise contemporary of this monday as goethe was indeed of standard to some extent gents says that it is one of the heads of the three-headed hydra the other two heads being reform a revolution it's in fact a left-wing menace and then it's the religion to the tradition and to the past which must be stamped out and the young french romantics legend france echoes this by saying le roman autism revolution revolution against what apparently against everything says romanticism is the passion flower sprung from the blood of christ a reawakening of the poetry of the middle ages the sleepwalking middle ages dreaming spires that look at you with deep dolorous eyes of grinning specters and marxists i think would add that it was indeed an escape from the horrors of the industrial revolution and ruskin i think would agree saying it is a contrast to the beautiful past with the frightful and the monotonous present which is a modification of heinous view but not all that different from it but lucia 10 says romanticism is a bourgeois revolt against aristocracy after 1789 romanticism is the expression of the energy and force of the new ideas the exact opposite it's it's it's the expression of the pushing vigorous powers of the new bourgeoisie against the old decent conservative values of society and history it's expression not a weakness nor of despair but of brutal optimism friedrichshlagel who i suppose is the greatest harbinger the greatest herald romanticism that ever lived the greatest prophet of it says there is a man a terrible unsatisfied desire to soar into infinity a feverish longing to break through the narrow bonds of individuality and you will find passages not all together like this in caldridge and indeed in shelley too but professor bruntier towards the end of the century says that it is literally egotism it is stressing individuality at the expense of a larger world it is the opposite of self-transcendence it is sheer self-assertion and the barrosier adds yes and agromania and primitivism and professor babbitt of harvard university echoes this schlegel fritischlegge's brother august wilhelm schlegel and madame de stahl both agreed that romanticism comes from the romance nations or at least the roman languages that it really comes from a modification of the verses of the provencal troubadours but renault says it's celtic gaston paris says it's bretton seyer says it comes from a mixture of plato and pseudo-dionysus theory of a guide professor nadla who is a learned german critic says that dramatism is really the homesickness of those germans who live between the elb and the neiman their homesickness for the old central germany from which they once came the daydreams of exiles and colonists eichendorf says it is protestant nostalgia for the catholic church but chateaubriand who didn't live between the elven lemon and therefore didn't experience these emotions says it is the secret and inexpressible delight of a soul playing with itself i speak everlastingly of myself and professor emote says it is the will to love something an attitude or an immersion towards others not towards oneself the very opposite of the will to power middleton mary says shakespeare was essentially a romantic writer and adds all great writers since russo have been romantic but the eminent marxist critic professor georg lucach says no great writers are romantic least of all scott hugo and standard so that in a sense as you can see there is some difficulty in attenuating what takes these quotations by about men who after all have deserved to be to berate but other in other respects profoundly brilliant writers in many subjects there is some difficulty in discovering what it is that is a common element in all these generalizations that is why professor northrop frye was very wise to warn against it and all these definitions so far as i know have never really been protested by anyone they have never incurred that degree of critical wrath which might have come to anyone who had really produced definitions or generalizations which were universally regarded as absurd and and irrelevant let me now go on to my the task which i next set myself which is to see what characteristics have on the whole being called romantic by writers on this subject by critics and a very peculiar result of mergers it is let me read what i've i've read there are no fewer than 10 categories which i've accumulated i must ask you to bear with me while i read them out but i think they do throw light upon the subject at any rate they indicate the extreme difficulty of the subject which i would sound wise to have chosen romanticism is the primitive the untutored it is youth life an exuberant sense of life of the natural man but it is also pala fever disease decadence the maladies la belle dam song merci the dance of death indeed death itself it is shelley's dome of many coloured glass and it is also his white radiance of eternity it is the confused teeming fullness full of the slaves the confused teeming fullness and richness of life inexhaustible multiplicity turbulence violence conflict chaos but also it is peace oneness with the great i am harmony with the natural order music of the spheres dissolution in the eternal all-containing spirit it is the strange the exotic the grace the mysterious the supernatural ruins moonlight enchanted castles hunting horns elves giants griffins falling water the old mill on the floss darkness and the powers of darkness phantoms vampires nameless terror the irrational the unutterable also it is the familiar the sense of one's unique tradition joy in the smiling aspect everyday nature and their custom sights and sounds of contented simple rural folk the same and happy wisdom of rosy cheeked sons of the soil it is the ancient the historic it is gothic cathedrals mists of antiquity ancient roots and the old order with its unanalyzable qualities its profound but inexpressible loyalties the impulpable the imponderable also it is the pursuit of novelty revolutionary change concern with the fleeting present desire to live in the moment rejection of knowledge past and future the pastoral ideal of happy innocence joy in the passing instant a sense of timelessness it is nostalgia it is reverie it is the intoxicating dreams it is sweet melancholy and bitter melancholy solitude the sufferings of exile the sense of alienation roaming in remote places especially east and roaming in remote times especially the middle ages but also it is happy cooperation in a common creative effort the sense of forming part of a church a class a party a tradition a great and and and all containing symmetrical hierarchy knights and retainers the rank the ranks of the church organic social ties mystic unity one faith one land one blood latter element as i think barrett said the great society of the dead and the living and the yet unborn it is the tourism of scot and saudi and wordsworth and it is the radicalism of shelley buchner and standalone it is chateaubrian's aesthetic medievalism and it is michele's loathing of the middle ages it is carlisle's worship of authority and hugo's hatred of authority its extreme nature mysticism and extreme anti-naturalist aestheticism it is energy force will youth life eta it's also self torture self annihilation suicide it is the primitive the unsophisticated the bosom of nature green fields cowbells murmuring brooks the infinite blue sky no less however it is also dandism the desire to dress up red waistcoats green wigs blue hair which the followers of people like gerard wore in paris period it's the lobster which gerard led about on a string in the streets of paris it's wild exhibitionism eccentricity it is the battle of vernani it's anui it's tidy vitae it is the death of south annapolis whether painted by darakra or written by berlioz or baron it is a convulsion of great empires wars slaughter and the crashing of worlds the romantic hero is the rebel the um fatal the damn soul corsairs manfred's jawas lara's gains all the population of baron's heroic blames it is melmos it is jean's bagar all the outcasts and ishmaels as well as the golden hearted courtesans and the noble-hearted convicts of 19th century fiction it is drinking out of the human skull it's barely yours who said he wanted to climb the euvils in order to commune with the kindred soul it's satanic rebels cynical irony diabolical laughter black heroes but also blake's vision of god and these angels the great christian society the eternal order and i quote the starry heavens which can scarce express the infinite and eternal of the christian soul it is in short unity and multiplicity its fidelity to particular in painting the paintings of nature for example and also mysterious tantalizing vagueness of outline its beauty and ugliness it asks for our sake and art is an instrument of social salvation its strength and weakness individualism and collectivism purity and corruption revolution and reaction peace and war love of life and love of death it is perhaps not very surprising that faced with this professor lovejoy who certainly the most scrupulous and one of the most illuminating scholars whoever dealt with the history of the idea of the last two centuries approached a condition nearing despair he said that not only were all the strands of romantic thought that she was able to unravel some of them contradict the others which is patently true some totally relevant to the others but he took two specimens of what nobody would deny to romanticism for example primitivism and he and the other eccentricity dentism announced what they had in common primitivism which began in english thus let's say and partly english prose at the beginning of 18th century celebrates the noble savage the simple life the irregular patterns of spontaneous action as against the corrupt sophistication and alexandria inverse of a highly sophisticated society it's an attempt to demonstrate there is natural law which can be discovered best in the untutored heart of the uncorrupted native of the uncorrupted child and says professor lovejoy quite intelligibly what has this in common with red waistcoats blue hair green wigs absent death suicide and the general eccentricity of the followers of nereval and goti and he concludes by saying that he really doesn't see what there is in common to these and one and one could sympathize with him well you might say perhaps you might perhaps say that there is an air of revolt in both both have revolted against some kind of civilization some in order to go to some robinson's cruiser island there to um commune with nature and live among uncorrupted simple people and the other in some kind of violent aestheticism and dangerousness but near the world cannot be romantic mere denunciation of corruption cannot be romantic we don't regard the hebrew prophets as particularly romantic we don't regard seven arola as particularly romantic we don't even regard methodist preachers as particularly romantic and therefore this i think is too wide of the mark one therefore has a certain sympathy with first love joy's despair in this matter let me read you a passage which his disciple professor boaz also of johns hopkins university wrote i prepared this after the discrim discrimination of romanticisms made by lovejoy there ought to be no further discussion of what romanticism really was there happens to be a variety of aesthetic doctrines some of which were logically related to others and some of it were not all called by the same name but this fact does not imply that they all had a common essence any more than the fact that hundreds of people are called john smith means that they are all of the same parentage this is perhaps the most common and misleading error arising from the confusion of ideas and words one could speak for hours about it alone and perhaps one should uh i wish i should like to relieve your theories immediately by saying that i don't supposed to do this but at the same time i think that the rest professor lovejoy and professor bowers are eminent scholars there and greater their contribution has been towards illumination of thought uh on this mistake there was a romantic movement it did have something which was central to it it did create a great revolution consciousness and it is important to discover what this is one can of course give up the whole game one can say like valerie words like romanticism and classicism words like humanism and naturalism are not words that are not names with which one can operate at all one cannot get drunk one cannot quench one's test with labels and bottles and finally there is much to be said to this point of view at the same time i think unless we do use some generalizations it is impossible to trace the course of human history therefore difficult as it may be it is important to find out what it was that caused this enormous revolution in human consciousness which appears to be to occur in those centuries there are people who i think faced with this plethora of evidence which i've attempted to collect may feel some sympathy for the late saratha quela kuch who said with typical british breeziness the whole power about the difference of classical romantic amounts to nothing that need trouble a healthy man i can't deny i can't deny that i don't share this point of view it appears to me it appears to me to be existably defeatist and therefore in the course of these lectures i attempt i should make do my best to try and explain what in my view the romantic movement fundamentally came think the only same and the only sensible way of approaching at least the only way that i've ever found to be helpful at all is by slow and patient historical method by looking at the beginning of the 18th century and considering what the situation was then and then considering what the factors were which undermined it one by one and what the particular combination of confluence the factors was which by 1760 by 1770 and by 1780 caused what appears to me to be the greatest transformation of the western consciousness certainly in our time thank you very much
