TRANSCRIPT:

ladies and gentlemen last time i spoke to you about the obscure figure of johann georg harman because i believe that he was the first person to declare war upon the enlightenment in the most open violent and complete fashion chronologically he's certainly the earliest to have done so to indicate that he was not entirely alone in this even in his own lifetime let me say this the 18th century as everybody knows is the platitude was i suppose the age of the great triumph of science certainly the great victories of science are the most phenomenal event of that particular period and certainly the profoundest revolution in human sentiment which occurred occurred as a result of the destruction of elder forms both the attack upon the established religion on the part of organized natural science and of the old medieval hierarchy by the new secular state at the same time there is no doubt that so far did the rationalism go that as always happens in such cases the human sentiment which is in some way blocked by rationalism of this type sought for some kind of egress in other directions when the olympian gods become too tame and too rational and too normal people naturally enough begin to incline towards darker morksonian deities this is certainly what happened in the third century bc in greece and what began happening in the 18th century there is no doubt that organized religion was in some sense on the retreat if you consider for example the kind of rational religion which was preached by the disciples of libraries in germany where for example the great philosopher wolf who dominated german universities tried to reconcile religion with reason and anything which couldn't be reconciled with reason became unfashionable and that is why it was necessary somehow to save religion by proving his harmony with reason wolf tried to do this by saying for example miracles could be reconciled with a rational interpretation of the universe by supposing for example that when joshua stopped the sun at jericho he was simply an astrophysicist with profounder knowledge than most of other astrophysicists of his time this degree this depth of penetration of astrophysical knowledge on his part was certainly miraculous that when christ turned water into wine he simply understood chemistry in a manner profounder than that which any human being not assisted by divine inspiration could have understood given that this is the depth to which rationalism had fallen and that religion had to make this kind of compromise in order to get any opportunity of being received at all it is perhaps not very surprising that people should have turned elsewhere for moral and spiritual satisfaction there is no doubt that while perhaps happiness and order might be provided by the new scientific philosophy the irrational desires of men the whole realm of those unconscious drives of which the 20th century has made us so very acutely aware began to breed some kind of satisfactions of its own and so perhaps somewhat to the surprise of people who believe the 18th century to have been a harmonious symmetrical infinitely rational elegant glassy sort of century a kind of peaceful mirror of human reason and human beauty not disturbed by anything deeper or darker to the surprise of people who think that i think i'm bound to point out that never in the history of europe had so many irrational persons wandered over the surface of europe claiming adherence i mean to say that it is in the 18th century when we begin with the masonic and the rosicrucian sects it is then that all kinds of charlatans and wanderers begin to affect particularly the second half of the century the minds of all kinds of apparently sane and rational persons it is then that caliostro appears in paris and gets involved in higher circles it is then that mesmer begins talking about animal spirits this is the favored age of all kinds of necromancers and chiromancers and hydromancers who wander over europe with ivaria's nostrums engaging their attention and indeed capturing the faith of a great many otherwise apparently sane and rational persons certainly the experiments in the occult of the kings of sweden and of denmark of the duchess of devonshire the cardinal is something which would have been surprising in the 17th century and unknown in the 19th this is the century therefore when these things begin to spread there were of course more respectable interesting manifestations of the same anti-rationalism for example laughter in zurich a kind of jung of his day invented the science of what he called physiognomia he attempted to measure people's faces for the purpose of obtaining some kind of insight into the psychological character because of a belief in the unity and indissolubility of the spiritual and the physical aspects of men at the same time he didn't discourage all those much more dubious phrenologists and spiritualists of one kind or another all those strange messiahs who wondered about occasionally committing crimes at other times merely causing perfection some of whom were arrested for their crimes other whom were allowed to wander about at large in the wilder and more old-fashioned portions for example of the german empires at any rate this is the atmosphere in which we move so under the surface of this apparently coherent and apparently elegant century there are all kinds of dark forces moving and harman of whom i spoke is merely the most political theologically the profoundest and in a sense the most interesting representative of this violent revolt of what might be called quality against quantity of the whole anti-scientific yearnings and desires of men harman's fundamental doctrine which i tried to expound perhaps over history last time was this that god was not a geometer he was not a mathematician that he was a poet that there was something blasphemous in attempting to fost upon god our own puny human logical schemes that when kant said to him haman being a friend of his that he thought that the science of astronomy had finally come to an end the astronomers knew all they could know and it was a satisfactory thing that this particular science could now be locked up as having been speak completed when said that said harman i felt like strangling him as if there would be no more miracles in the universe as if any human endeavor could be regarded as over and done with finished the very notion that human beings were finite that there were certain subjects about which everything could be known that there was some portion of nature which could be fully investigated and some questions which could be ultimately answered to all this appeared him to be shocking unreal and plainly stupid this i think it really is the heart of haman's doctrine it is a kind of mystical vitalism which perceives in nature and in history the voice of god that the voice of god speaks to us through nature was an old mystical belief harman added to this the further doctrine that history too speaks to us that all the various historical events which are simply taken to be ordinary empirical events by unenlightened historians are really methods whereby the divine speaks to us each of these events possesses an occult of mystical significance which those with eyes to see can perceive he was among the earliest of those and when i say earliest of those i mean that he was later than vico but then vika wasn't read that he was among the earliest of those who said that myths myths and symbols myths were not simply false statements about the world not either the wicked inventions of unscrupulous persons seeking to throw dust in people's eyes nor pretty embellishments invented by poets for the purpose of in some way decorating their awares myths were ways in which human beings expressed their sense of the ineffable and inexpressible mysteries of nature and there was no other way in which they could be expressed if words were used they didn't do their job properly words cut things to pieces too much words classified words were too rational the attempt to tie things up to neat parcels and arrange them in some beautifully analytic fashion destroyed the unity the continuity and the vitality of the subject matter that is to say life in the world which we were contemplating myths in some way conveyed this mystery in artistic images and artistic symbols which without words managed to connect man with the mysteries of nature this was roughly speaking the doctrine now the whole thing was of course immense protest against the french it spread not only to germany if it was phenomena of this kind are noticeable in england also where perhaps the most eloquent exponent of this point of view will come somewhat later in time than harman is of course the mystical poet william blake blake's enemies the persons who blake regards as the villains of the whole modern period are lock and newton them he regards as those devils who killed the spirit by cutting reality into some kind of mathematically symmetrical pieces whereas reality is a living whole which can only be appreciated in some non-mathematical fashion let me give you typical questions from blake in that sense which will convey this too he was a typical swedenborgian and the swedenborg's disciples were very typical of the kind of occult subterranean movements in the 18th century which i referred to what blake like all mystics of his type desired was some kind of recovery of control over the spiritual element which in some way become petrified as a result of human degeneration and the wicked work of unimaginative killers of the human spirit like mathematicians and scientists he says laws are needed to fence men off and their children wept and built tombs in desolate places and formed laws of prudence and and called them the eternal laws of god this is directed against what might be called rationalists of the 18th century and the whole notion of symmetrically arranged order founded upon non-mystical empirical or logical reasoning when he writes in those famous lines which everyone knows robin's red breast in a cage puts all heaven in the rage the cage of which he speaks is the enlightenment and that is the cage in which he and persons like him appear to suffocate all their lives in the second half of the 18th century children of a future age reading this indignant page know that in the former time love sweet love was thought a crime love to him was identical with art jesus he calls an artist his disciples he also calls artists art is the tree of life science is the tree of death liberate the spark that is the great cry of all persons who feel somehow strangled and suffocated by the new tidy scientific order which doesn't respond to the deeper problems which educate the human soul the germans tended on the whole to suppose that in france nobody was aware nobody began to be aware of what these deeper problems were that all the french were somehow desiccated monkeys with no conception of what it was that moved human beings human beings as possessors of souls as possessors of some kind of spiritual needs this is not entirely true if for example you go to such a representative think of the enlightenment as even diedro upon whom i suppose the germans looked as one of the the germans of whom i speak looked as one of the most noxious representatives of the new materialism the new science the new uh destruction of all the prosperity of the religious in life if you go to someone like that in him you will find something which is not all that unlike the particular attitude even among the germans which i have described pedro is perfectly aware that there is such thing as the irrational element in man and though there are unconscious depths in which all kinds of dark forces move and he is aware that human genius feeds upon these and that the forces of light are not by themselves enough to create those divine works of art which he himself at mars he speaks of art very often in terms of great passion and says that there is about the great genius there is about the great artist something which is the 17th century expression which enables him to imagine these works of art with a degree of sweep with a magnificence of depths of insight and with a degree of intellectual courage the taking on of huge intellectual risks which makes men of genius and artists of this type akin to great criminals and there is a there is a passage in the draw where he speculates upon the nearness to criminals of artists because they both defy rules they are both persons who are in some way in love with power magnificence and splendor and kick over the traces of normal life normal existence and the whole tame existence of over civilized man deidre is among the first to preach there are two men there is the artificial man who belongs in society and conforms to the practices of society and seeks to please and is artificial the sort of normal artificial mincing little figure of the caricatures of the 18th century within this man however there is imprisoned a violent bold dark criminal instinct of a man who wishes to break out and this is the man who is properly controlled is perhaps responsible for the magnificent works of genius which are created genius of this type can't be tamed genius of this type has nothing to do with those rules which the abe butter or the abe dubose laid down as being the rational conventions the rational rules in accordance with which alone good works of art will be produced let me read you the typical passage beware this is comes from the solo of 1765 that is to say one of those early art criticisms uh for which is justly famous beware of those whose pockets are full of esprit of wit and who scatter this wit at every opportunity everywhere they have no demon within them they are not gloomy or somber or melancholy or silent they are never either awkward or foolish the lark the chaffinch the limit the canary they trap and twitter all the live long day at sunset they fill their head under their wing and now they're asleep it is then the genius takes his lamp and lights it and this dark solitary savage bird this untameable creature with its gloomy melancholy plumage opens its throat and begins its song makes the groves resound and breaks the silence and the darkness of the night this is an appeal to genius as in contrast with talent in contrast with rules in contrast with the so-called wanted virtues of the 18th century sanity rationality measure proportion and all the rest of it which shows that even in this terrible desiccated city of paris where according to the germans nobody has ever lived nobody has ever seen a color nobody has ever known what a stirring of the human soul is nobody has any notion of what the agonies of the spirit are what god is or what transfiguration of man may be in this city town there were persons who were aware of what might be called self-transcendence of irrational forces of something which undoubtedly was somewhat of the same type as that which harman sang saying forth but of course and at this point somebody will again say what about rousseau well what indeed about russo it would be foolish to deny that rousseau was one of the great factors the russo's doctrines at least ruthless words were among the facts which influenced the romantic movement nevertheless again i have to repeat his role has been exaggerated if you consider what it is that russo actually said as opposed to the manner in which he said it and i think the manner and the life is what are important if you ask yourself what russo said what he said is the purest milk of the rationalist word all through so said is we live in a corrupt society we live in a bad hypocritical society where men lie to each other and murder each other and are false before each other that it is possible to discover the truth that this truth is to be discovered not by means of sophistication or cartesian logic but by looking within the heart of the simple uncorrupt human being the noble savage or the child or whoever it may be that once this truth is discovered it is an eternal truth true for all men everywhere in all times and seasons and when we have discovered this truth then it is important that we should live in accordance with it this is not different from what the hebrew prophets have said or every christian preacher who has ever preached against the corrupt sophistication of the big cities and the falling away from god which goes on in such places russo's actual doctrine is not very different from that of the encyclopedists he disliked them personally because temperamentally he was a kind of dervish from the desert he was paranoid savage and gloomy in some respects and highlighted neurotic as we should today say and therefore hidden much in common with the people at holbach's rather irreverent table or the elegant receptions which voltaire held at vernee but this was to a certain degree a personal or emotional matter the actual substance of what russo said was not so very different from the official enlightened doctrine of the 18th century what was different was the manner and what was different was the temperament when rousseau begins describing his own particular states of mind and states of soul when he begins describing the emotions which tear him apart the violent paroxysms of rage or joy through which he goes then of course he does use a tone which is very different from that of the 18th century but this is not the doctrine of rousseau which was inherited by the jacobins or which in various forms entered into the doctrines of the 19th century let me redo the kind of passage of rousseau which does entitle him to be regarded as one of the fathers of romanticism i didn't reason i didn't philosophize ravished i surrendered to the confusion of these great ideas i suffocated in the universe i wanted to leap into the infinite my spirit gave itself to swelling ecstasy that of course is a passage which is not very similar to the sobera or seiner passages of the encyclopedists that wouldn't have been cared for by helvisius or holbach or by voltaire or even diedro rousseau's point was that nobody could love as the russo loved nobody could hate as russo hated nobody could suffer as russo suffered and only russo could understand rousseau he was unique nobody else could understand him but only a genius could understand another genius this was in this in a certain sense a doctrine opposed to the view that the truth was equally open to all reasonable men who did not become their understandings with unnecessary emotions and with unnecessary ignorance what rousseau does is to contrast with the so-called killed logic which he constantly complains about killed reason he contrasts with it the hot tears of shame or joy or misery or love or despair or mortification or spiritual agony or ecstatic vision and that is why harman called him the best of the sophists but still a sophist still a sophist harman was socrates and russo was the suffix he was the best because he gave signs of understanding that it wasn't quite right with this elegant and rational and sane paris but still even the suffix because these doctrines still appeal to reason they still appeal to the fact that there was some kind of establishment some kind of good kind of human life with good kind of men if only they would scrape off all the falsehood which had managed to accumulate upon them through the centuries if only they could remove the bad society which had corrupted them if only they could manage to do that then they could live well forever in accordance with timeless precepts that is precisely what the germans disbelieved and precisely what they rightly accused russo in believing the only difference was that the other encyclopedias in paris believed this could be done by reform they believed this could be done by gradually they believed this might be done by somehow converting converting the rulers to that point of view getting hold of an enlightened despot and if he was enlightened enough he could establish some kind of better life on earth rousseau believed that the whole cursed superstructure must be raised to the ground the entire wicked human society must be burnt to ashes and then a new phoenix would arise constructed by him and by his disciples but in principle what they wish to do was the same although perhaps their view of the methods may have differed now if you compare this this kind of talk with what the germans were saying at the same time you will see that the german attitude towards all this is far more violent let me read you a typical passage from the bird lentz who did in fact commit suicide who was a contemporary of rousseau roughly speaking and says the following action action is the soul of the world not pleasure not abandonment of feeling not abandonment to reasoning only action only by action does well become the image of god the god who creates ceaselessly and ceaselessly rejoices in his works without action all pleasure all feeling all knowledge is nothing but a postponed death we must not cease from toil until we have created free space even if this space is a fearful waste and a fearful void and then we shall brood over it as god brooded over the waste and the void before the world was created and then something will arise oh bliss oh god-like feeling this is something a very different order from even the most violent victorians from the most ecstatic explanations of russo and indicates a very different attitude this sudden passion for action as such and hatred of any established order hatred of any kind of view of the universe as having a structure which calm or even uncalm perception is able to understand contemplate classify describe and finally use this i think is unique to the germans again if you ask for the causes of this i don't wish to go back to what i was saying last time namely that it was largely due i think to as it were both the intense spirituality of pietism from amongst whom these people spring on the one hand and on the other hand to the refugees of science which would undermined their pietistic faith and while leaving them with a temperament of pietists had removed their religious certainties of that movement but if you look at the plays and the fourth and fifth and sixth straight plays which the so-called storm and stress movement in germany produced in the 60s and seventies you will that find a very different tone from that prevailing anywhere else in european literature if you look for example at klinger's play klinger was a was a german playwright uh who wrote the play called storm storm and drang storm and stress after whom the movement is called there's a play by klinger called the twins in which one of the twins a more powerful imaginative and fiery romantic kills his weak pridish and disagreeable brother because he says because his brother won't let him develop his nature in accordance with his demonic or titanic demands now in all previous tragedies the assumption was that in some other society there will be no need for these dreadful things to occur society is bad therefore it must be improved men are done down by society well then one must be able to imagine a better society as rousseau was able to imagine it in which people do not suffocate in which people do not fight in which the bed are not at the top and the good at the bottom in which parents do not torture their children in which women are not married off to men they do not love it must be possible to construct a better world not so in klinger's tragedy not so in julio's frontal rent attended by elizabeth i don't wish to recite before you these justly forgotten names but broadly speaking the substance of all these plays is that there is some kind of insoluble conflict in the world in nature itself by which the strong cannot live with the weak the lions cannot live with the lambs the strong must have rumors to breathe and the weak go to the wall if they do it and the weak will suffer and will naturally resist and it is right the weak should resist and it is right that the strong suppress them and therefore conflict collision tragedy death all kinds of horrors which go on are in some way inevitably involved in the nature of the universe and the view is therefore fatalistic and pessimistic not scientific and optimistic not even spiritual and optimistic in any sense the word this has a kind of natural affinity to harman's view that god is closer to the abnormal than he is to the normal which in fact he openly says the normal don't really understand what goes on you see it's a sort of original perhaps moment at which the whole what might be called dostoyevsky complex comes into existence in which god is in a certain sense of course the application of christianity but a rather new one because so sincere and so deeply intended in which god is closer to the thieves and the prostitutes the sinners and the publicans than he is harman says to the smooth the philosophers of tennis or the smooth clergymen in berlin who are trying to reconcile religion with reason which is degradation and humiliation of everything that man cares for all the great masters who excelled in human endeavour says harman where sick men in one way or another had wounds hercules ajax socrates and paul so long the hebrew prophets baccantes demonic figures none of these were men of good sense and that i think it lies at the heart so to speak of the whole of this violent doctrine of personal self-assertion which is really the heart of the german storm and stress however all these persons are comparatively minor figures i merely wish to bring them out in order to show you that harman who i think just does deserve to be rescued from the darkness of oblivion wasn't entirely alone the only worthwhile the only valuable work which torment drawing produced i suppose was verstappen which was a typical expression of it also there too there is no cure there is no situation in which verta can avoid suicide there is no situation in which verta being in love with the married lady and the marriage vow being what it is and believed by verta and by the lady herself to be what it is there is no way in which this problem could be solved if one man's love and another man's love come into collusion it is a hopeless and helpless business and must end badly that is the moral of their and that is why young men up and down germany was said to have committed suicide in its name not because in the 18th century or in that particular society there was no adequate solution as because they despaired of the world and sought an irrational place in which a solution was in principle undiscoverable this then is the atmosphere to speak which developed in germany in the 1760s and 1770s but there were two men who were i think the true fathers of romanticism who were certainly of faster size than any of the people i have mentioned these are two as being responsible for it and about whom i miss next speak they both emerge from this movement one in some sense sympathetic to it the other acutely hostile to it but by his work a greater advance of its ideals as ironically sometimes happens the first is herder the second is and on them i must stop a little i don't wish to expound to the general ideas and the new notions for which held as responsible and by which he transformed for example our notions of history our notions of society the vast influence which this extraordinary thing i had he was also of course a pietist and a prussian and like the others revolted against the  and span empire of frederick the great it was rarely this tidy enlightened despotism and it was enlightened managed by french intellectuals and french officials under the leadership of this extremely clear-headed and extremely energetic and extremely powerful despot that really caused these good men to suffocate even let alone herder who was by nature of a somewhat irresistible and somewhat unbalanced temperament the doctrines of which i wish to speak are these there are three doctrines in particular which contributed to the romantic movement very powerfully and which arose quite naturally out of the milieu which i've spoken one is the notion of what i should like to call expressionism the other is the notion of belonging what it means to belong to a group and the third is the notion that ideals true ideals are often incompatible with one another and cannot be reconciled these three ideas each had a revolutionary significance in their day and are worth lingering over a little because they're commonly not done justice to even in primers of the history of thought the first notion of expression expressivism is this herder believed that one of the fundamental functions of human beings was to express to speak and therefore that whatever a man did express his full nature and if it didn't express his full nature it's because he named himself or restrained himself or in some way laid some kind of leash upon his energies and this he learned of course from his master harman he really was a direct and faithful disciple of this strange figure harman who was called the magus in northern the magus in the north magus meaning one of the three magi in that sense of makers now normally speaking if we take for example the aesthetics of the 18th century even the the city much more passionate aesthetics or something like pedro than the dry and conventional aesthetics of the abe but if we take the aesthetics of the 18th century broadly speaking the value of a work of art would be said to consist in its being what it was namely the value of a picture was that it was beautiful what made it beautiful one could argue about whether it was because it gave pleasure whether because it satisfied the intellect whether it was because it had some peculiar relation to the harmonies of the spheres of the universe and was in some way um a copy of some great platonic original to which the artist at a moment of inspiration had access about that you might disagree what everyone agreed about was that the value of a work of art consisted in the properties which it had being what it is beautiful symmetrical shapelet whatever it might be a silver bowl was beautiful because it was a beautiful bowl because it had the properties of being beautiful however that was defined this had nothing to do with who made it and it had nothing to do with why it was made the artist took very much the position of a purveyor who said my private life is no business of the man who buys the work of art you have asked for a silver bowl here it is i provide it it is no business of yours whether i am a good husband or a good voter or a nice man or believe in god you have asked for a table here is a table if it is a solid sound table such as you need what complaints can you have you have asked for a painting you've asked for a portrait if it is a good portrait take it i am mozart i am hayden i hope to produce a beautiful musical composition by which i mean one which will be recognized as beautiful by others and for which i should be paid an adequate commission and which will perhaps make my name as an immortal artist that is the normal 18th century view and it is the view of a great many people indeed probably the majority since this was not the view which the germans of whom i speak took particularly not harman and certainly not here a work of art is the expression of somebody it's always a voice speaking a work of art is the voice of one man addressing himself to other men and whether it be a silver bowl or a musical composition or a poem or even a code of laws whatever it might be any artifact of human hands is in some way the expression of the attitude to life conscious and unconscious of its makeup when we appreciate a work of art were put in some kind of contact with a man who made it and in some sense it speaks to us that is certainly the doctrine that is why the idea that an artist should say as an artist i do this and as a voter husband i do that the very notion that a man can in some way chop himself up into compartments and say that with one hand i do one thing and this has nothing to do with what my other hand is doing that my private convictions have nothing to do with the speeches which i put into the mouths of the characters in my tragedy that i am simply a purveyor that what must be judged is the work of art and not the maker the biography the psychology the purposes the whole substance so to speak of the artist is irrelevant to the work of art that doctrine was rejected with violence by herder and by those who followed him who said if take for example folk song if a folk song speaks to you it is because the people who have made it were germans like yourself and they spoke to you who belong with them in the same society and because they were germans they use particular nuances they use particular successions of sounds they use particular words which being in some way connected with swimming in the great tide of words and symbols and experience upon which all germans swim has something peculiar to say to certain persons which it cannot say to certain other persons the portuguese cannot understand the inwardness of a german song is a german can and the german cannot understand the inwardness of a portuguese song and the very fact that there is such thing as inwardness at all in these songs is an argument for supposing that these are not simply objects like objects in nature which don't speak they are were there in some sense artifacts that's to say something which a man has made for the purpose of communicating with another man this is a doctrine of art as expression or the doctrine of art as communication and then of course herder goes on from this to develop the thesis in the most political and imaginative manner and he says some things are made by individuals and other things are made by groups some things are made consciously and other things are made unconsciously if you ask who has made folk song who has made folk dancing who has made the german laws who has made the german models who has made the institutions under which we live you cannot give the answer this lies shrouded in the mists of impersonal antiquity nevertheless men have made it the world is what men have made of it our world our german world is constructed by other germans and that is why it smells and feels and looks and it sounds to us as it does and from this he developed the notion that every man seeks to belong to some kind of group or in fact does belong to it and if taken out of it will feel alien and not at home the whole notion of being at home or being cut off from one's natural roots the whole idea of roots the whole idea of belonging to a group a sect a movement was invented largely by herder there are anticipations of this in the marvelous work of eco but i have today again the works of vika had been forgotten and although herder might have seen it in the late 70s he developed most of his ideas before any date at which apparently he had seen the work of his great italian predecessor herrera's fundamental conviction was something of this order that every man who wishes to express himself uses words words are not his invention they are sitting already inherited by him in some kind of inherited stream of traditional images this stream itself has been fed by other men expressing themselves a man who has been has more in common of an impulsive kind with other men with whom nature has placed him in some proximity than he has with men removed from him herder doesn't use the criteria of blood and he doesn't use the criteria of race he talks about nation but nazi own in the 18th century didn't have the connotation of nation in the 19th he speaks of language as a bond and he speaks of soil as a bond and the thesis roughly speaking is that that which people who belong to the same group have in common is more directly responsible for their being as they are than that which they have in common with others in other places to wit the way in which let us say a german rises and sits down the way in which he dances the way in which he legislates his handwriting and his poetry and his music and the way which it combs his hair and the way in which he philosophizes all have some impulpable common gestalt all have some pattern quality in virtue of which they are recognizably german both by him and by others wherein they differ from similar acts on the part of the chinese the chinese also comb their hair they also write poetry they also have laws they also hunt and obtain their food in various ways and make that closing and there is something common of course to the way in which all men react to similar natural stimuli nevertheless there is a peculiar gestalt quality which qualifies certain human groups not nationalities perhaps perhaps these groups are smaller here they were certainly not a nationalist in the sense of believing speak there was some kind of deep impulpable essence to do certainly with blood or race all he believed was that human groups grew in some plant-like or some animal-like fashion and that organic botanical and other biological metaphors were more suitable for describing such growth than where the chemical and mathematical metaphors of the french 18th century popularizers of science now from this certain romantic conclusions certainly do follow that's the second conclusion which affected anti-rationalism as at least it was understood in the 18th century and that is this that if indeed this is so then it clearly follows that objects can't be described without reference to the purposes of their makers the value of a work of art has to be somehow analyzed in terms of the particular group of persons to whom it is addressed the motive of him who speaks the effect upon those who are spoken to and the bond which it automatically creates between the speaker and the spoken toe it is a form of communication and if it is a form of communication then it hasn't got what might be called an impersonal or eternal value if you wish to understand a work of art for example made by some ancient greek it is certainly no use laying down timeless criteria in terms of what all works of art must be beautiful and then considering whether the greek work of art is beautiful or not in terms of these criteria unless you understand what the greeks were what they wanted how they lived unless as herder says echoing vico in the most uncanny way as herder says by an act of most enormous difficulty with the greatest possible effort of the imagination unless you enter into the feelings of these remote exceedingly strange peoples who are remote from you in time and place unless you try by some active imagination to reconstruct within yourself the form of life which these people led what they wanted how they lived what their laws were what their ethical principles were what the streets looked like what the various values were unless you try in other words to live yourself into that form of life all this is commonplace now that was not commonplace in the 1760s and 70s when it was first spoken unless you try and do that your chances of truly understanding that art and truly understanding their writings and really knowing what plato meant and really knowing who socrates was are small socrates for him is not the timeless sage of the french enlightenment timeless rationally sage nor is he simply the ironical deflator of pompous no alls which is what haman conceived him to be socrates is a fifth century athenian who lived in fifth century athens not in the fourth century not in the second not in germany not in france but in greece then and only then and in order to understand greek philosophy you must understand greek art in order to understand greek art you must understand greek history in order to understand greek history with centers in greek geography you must see the plants which they saw you must understand the soil in which they lived and so on and so on and this therefore becomes the beginning of the whole notion of historicism evolutionism the very notion that you can only understand other human beings in terms of an environment very disabled your own and this is also at the root of and this is what the notion of belonging is the notion of what it is to belong to somebody was rarely elucidated for the first time by herder and that is why the whole notion of cosmopolitan man a man who's equally at home in paris at copenhagen or iceland or india is to him repentant a man belongs to where he is people have roots they can only create in terms of those symbols in which they were brought up and they were brought up in terms of some kind of closed society which spoke to them in a uniquely intelligible fashion any man who hasn't had the good fortune to suffer this any man was brought up without roots on a desert island by himself in exile an immigrant is to that extent weakened and his creative powers are automatically made the smaller this was not a doctrine which could have been understood certainly which could not have been approved of by the rationalist universalist objectivist cosmopolitan thinkers of the french 18th century that was the first point but a far more starting conclusion very follows in this which herder didn't perhaps himself altogether stress and that was this if the value of every culture resides in what that particular culture seeks after as he says every culture has its own center of gravity and you must determine what the center of gravity the schwerer punctures he calls it what the center of gravity is before you can even understand what these men were about certainly is no use judging these things the point of view of some other century or some other culture if you have to do that then you will grasp the fact that different ages had different ideals and these ideas were each in its way valid for those times in those places and can be admired and can be appreciated by us now but now i in my very first lecture i tried to lay down the proposition that one of the great axioms of the 18th century enlightenment which is what romanticism came to destroy was that there could be valid objective answers could be discovered to all the great questions which educate mankind how to live what to be what is good what is bad what is right what is wrong what is beautiful what is ugly why app does rather than thus and these answers can be obtained by some special method recommended by the particular thinker in question and that all these answers can be stated in the form of propositions and all these propositions if they are true will be compatible with one another perhaps even more than compatible perhaps they will even entail one another and taken together these propositions will as it were constitute that ideal state of affairs that perfect state of affairs which for one reason or another we all would like to see happen whether or not it is actually practicable or feasible now if herder is right if fifth century greeks could only go for an ideal quite different without the babylonians if the egyptian view of life because these people lived in egypt which had a different geography and a different climate and different other factors and because the egyptians were descended from people with a completely different ideology from the greeks if what the egyptians wanted was different what the greeks wanted but equally valid equally fruitful if all these things are true and the hebrew is one of those not very many thinkers in the world who really do absolutely adore things for being what they are and don't condemn them for not being something else they for hear that everything is delightful he's delighted by babylon and he's delighted by syria he's delighted by india and he's delighted by egypt he thinks well of the greeks he thinks well of the middle ages he thinks well of the 18th century he thinks well of almost everything except the immediate environment of his own time and place but if there is anything in here that which he dislikes it is the elimination of one culture by another he doesn't like julius caesar because julius caesar trampled on a lot of asiatic cultures and we shall now not know what the cappadocians were really after he doesn't like crusades because the crusades damaged the byzantines or they damaged the arabs and these cultures had every right to the richest and fullest of expression without the trampling feat of a lot of imperialist knights he dislikes every form of violence coercion and the swallowing of one culture by another because he wants everything to be as much of what it is as it can possibly be herder is really the originator and the author if you like not of nationalism as he sometimes said although some of his ideas internationalism but much more i don't quite know what give name to give it to something like populism that is to say if you like in its more comical forms he is really the originator of all those antiquarians who want natives to remain as native as possible who like arts and crafts who detest standardization everyone who likes the queen people who wish to preserve the most exquisite forms of old provincialism without impingement upon it of some hideous metropolitan uniformity the herder israeli the father and the ancestor of all those travelers all those amateurs who go around the world senating out all kinds of forgotten forms of life delighted in everything that is peculiar everything that is odd everything that is native everything is untouched in that sense of course he did feed the streams of human sentimentality to a very high degree but that is anyhow helped with temperament and that is why since he wants everything to be as much of what it can be as it can be that's to develop itself to its richest fullest extent the notion that there can be one single ideal for all men everywhere becomes unintelligible if the greeks had an ideal which was perfect for them as greeks and if the romans had an idea which was less perfect but as much as could be done for people who were unfortunately romans who were obviously less gifted in the greeks at least from headless point of view if the middle ages produced magnificent works early middle ages in the form say of the song of the nebulons which he much admired or the other early epics which he regarded as the simple heroic expressions of contaminated fresh peoples still wandering in the woods uncrushed by some fearful jealous neighbors who trample upon their culture in a brutal way if all this is true we can't have all these things together what is the ideal form of life we can't be both greek and phoenician and medieval and eastern and western and northern and southern we can't attain the highest ideals of all the centuries in all the places at once since we can't do that the whole notion of the perfect life the whole notion of that being a human ideal which it is the business of all men to strive after that there is some kind of answer to these questions even if there is an answer in chemistry or as there is an answer in physics or as there is an answer in mathematics to certain questions to which in principle at least some kind of final answer can be given or if not final answer attenuate an answer which approximates the finality which is more final than we've obtained yet with a hope or at least a direction that the further will proceed in the same direction the nearer to the final solution we come if this is true of physics and of chemistry and mathematics and as the 18th century thought should be true of ethics of politics of aesthetics if it is possible to lay down criteria which tell you what makes a perfect work of art what makes a perfect life what makes a perfect character what makes a perfect political constitution if it is possible to give these answers this answer can only be obtained by so to speak supposing that all other answers however interesting however fascinating are false but if herder is right and it was right for the greeks to proceed in the greek direction and it was right for the indians to proceed in indian direction and the greek ideal and the indian ideal are totally incompatible which he not merely confessed but emphasized with a kind of joy if variety and difference are not merely a fact about the world but a splendid fact which is what he thought it to be and argues for the variety of the imagination of the creator and the splendor of human creative powers and the infinite possibilities still before mankind and the unfulfillability of human ambitions and the general excitement of living in a world in which nothing can never be fully exhausted if that is the image then the notion of final answer to the question how to live becomes absolutely meaningless it can mean nothing at all because all these answers are presumably incompatible with one another hence herder's finals it's conclusion namely that each group each human group must strive after that which somehow lies in its bones which is part of his tradition each man belongs to group he belongs to his business as a human being is to speak speak the truth as it appears to him the truth as it appears to him is as valid as the truth as it appears to others from this vast variety of colors a wonderful mosaic can be made but nobody can see the whole mosaic nobody can see all the trees only god can see the entire universe men because they belong where they belong and are where they are and live what they do cannot but each age has its own internal ideal and therefore any form of nostalgic seeking after the past for example why cannot we be like the greeks why cannot we be like the romans which is presumably what french political philosophers or french painters or french sculptors were saying to themselves in the 18th century the whole notion of revival the whole notion of going back to middle ages back to roman virtues back to sparta back to athens or alternatively any form of cosmopolitanism why cannot we create this world state of such a kind that everybody in it will fit smoothly like ideal bricks will form a structure which will go on forever and ever because it is constructed upon an indestructible formula which is the truth obtained by infallible methods all this must become nonsense meaningless self-contradictory and by uttering this by issuing this particular allowing this particular doctrine to emerge herder did plunge a most terrible dagger into the body of european rationalism from which it never recovered and in this sense he is certainly one of the fathers of the romantic movement to which i have not yet come that is to say he is one of the fathers of the movement one of the attributes the characteristics of which certainly is the denial of unity the denial of harmony the denial of the compatibility of ideals whether in the sphere of action or in the sphere of thought and lens posture which i read to about action action always action make room for action we can only live in action otherwise nothing is worth having that is very sympathetic to her does her point of view because for him life consists in expressing experience as it comes communicating it to others with the whole of your undivided personality as for what men will make within 200 years time 500 years time 2000 years time it doesn't matter he doesn't care he doesn't see why you should care and this i think is a very new and extremely revolutionary and very upsetting note in what had for the last two thousand years been the solid philosophia perennis of the west according to which all questions have true answers all true answers are in principle discoverable and all the answers are in principle compatible or combinable into one harmonious whole like a jigsaw puzzle if what herder said was true this is false and upon this people then proceeded to argue and to struggle both in practice and in theory both in the course of national revolutionary wars and in the course of violent conflict of doctrines and of practice both in the arts and in thought for the next 170 years next time i propose to talk to you about kant about whom i fear i didn't have time to talk today and shilla and by this time really to enter into the heart of romanticism proper thank you very [Applause] [Music] much
