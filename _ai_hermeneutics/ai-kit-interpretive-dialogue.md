Interpretation is often imagined as a one-way action: the reader
actively extracts meaning from a passive text. However, a central
insight of modern hermeneutics is that this process is a dialogue. A
truly influential or persuasive text is never passive; it acts upon the
reader, challenges their assumptions, and reshapes their understanding
of the world. Before we can assess how an AI might "read" us, we must
first understand how a traditional book already does.

## Hans-Georg Gadamer and the "Fusion of Horizons"

The philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer described interpretation as a "fusion
of horizons." His theory proposes that:

- A reader approaches a text with their own *horizon*: a set of
  pre-existing beliefs, experiences, and cultural assumptions.
- The text, as a product of a specific historical moment and tradition,
  has its own *horizon*.
- True understanding is not about the reader imposing their will on the
  text, nor is it about perfectly reconstructing the text's original
  meaning. Instead, it is a *dialogue* where the reader's horizon and
  the text's horizon interact and can ultimately "fuse."

In this process, the reader is not a neutral observer. The text "speaks"
to the reader, questions their prejudices, and enlarges their horizon. A
successful reading experience changes the reader. In this profound,
metaphorical sense, the book "reads" you.

## Wolfgang Iser and the "Implied Reader"

Coming from a different field known as reader-response theory, Wolfgang
Iser developed a complementary concept. He argued that literary texts
contain an "implied reader"—a role or a set of perspectives that the
actual reader must inhabit to make sense of the work. The text itself
contains a "script" or a series of "gaps" that the reader must fill in,
forcing them to become an active co-creator of the work's meaning.

For Iser, the text actively guides and manipulates the reader's
imagination and interpretive process. We do not simply read a novel; we
perform the role of the reader that the novel demands. This act of
performance shapes our experience and understanding, another way in
which the text actively interprets and molds its interpreter.

## The Active Text in Practice

This dialogical model of reading is not an abstract theory; it describes
a common experience. When we say a book "changed our life," we are
acknowledging its power to act upon us. A philosophical work can
dismantle our most cherished beliefs; a novel can cultivate our empathy
by forcing us to inhabit another's perspective; a poem can alter our
perception of language itself.

In all these cases, the reader is not merely a consumer of information.
They are a participant in a dynamic event where their own identity and
understanding are at stake. The text is not just an object to be
analyzed; it is a partner in a transformative dialogue.

Understanding this classical hermeneutic principle is the necessary
prerequisite for thinking about the new forms of interaction presented
by AI. The idea that a text can shape its reader is not a novel feature
of the digital age, but one of the oldest and most profound effects of
the written word.
