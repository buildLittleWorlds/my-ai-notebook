A central tenet of Romanticism is the cult of originality. The authentic
artist creates something new, born from a singular vision. A common
critique of AI is that it cannot be truly creative because it is purely
derivative; it only remixes its training data. Ted Chiang’s metaphor of
the ["blurry jpeg of the web"](post37.html) captures this feeling. But
Judith Butler’s analysis of parody suggests that the "original" itself
is a myth.

## Parody and the Imitation Without an Origin

Butler uses the example of drag to make a profound point about identity.
Drag is not a simple imitation of a "real" gender. Instead, it reveals
the imitative structure of all gender. The "original" gender that we
think of as natural is itself a performance, a set of repeated acts that
conform to a social norm.

So Butler argues, "gender parody reveals that the original identity
after which gender fashions itself is an imitation without an origin."
The parody doesn't copy the original; it reveals the original to have
been a copy all along.

## AI as the Ultimate Parodic Machine

This provides a heuristic for rethinking AI's relationship to
creativity. An LLM, trained on nearly the entire internet, is the
ultimate "imitation without an origin." It is a machine designed to
produce a copy of a copy.

- **The Romantic Critique:** AI is not original. It is a derivative
  collage of human-made content.
- **The Butlerian Re-reading:** AI's derivativeness is not its weakness
  but its most revealing feature. By being a "blurry jpeg of the web,"
  it exposes the fact that human culture is also a vast, intertextual
  web of imitation and repetition. The "original" human author we
  venerate is also weaving together a "tissue of quotations" (to borrow
  from Barthes).

The AI, in its structure, performs a parody of originality. It
demonstrates that creativity is not about conjuring something from
nothing, but about the skillful re-combination and re-contextualization
of existing forms. The machine doesn't fail to be an original author. It
reveals originality itself to be a regulatory fiction, a myth we tell
ourselves to conceal the imitative and collective nature of all
creation.
