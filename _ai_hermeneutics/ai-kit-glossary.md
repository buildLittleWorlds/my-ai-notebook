Essential terms for AI hermeneutics. Each entry gives a crisp definition
plus a *why it matters for AI texts* note so readers can immediately
apply it in practice.

Absolute Distanciation <span class="small">(a "creative" adaptation of Ricoeur's term)</span>  
Shorthand for the extreme textual distance of AI outputs: unlike human
writing (which becomes autonomous through inscription), AI texts begin
without an originating consciousness.

Active Forces (Deleuze/Nietzsche)  
Forces that go to the limit of what they can do, affirming their own
difference and creating new possibilities.

Appropriation  
In Ricoeur's hermeneutics, the reader’s act of making the meaning of a
text one’s own.

Author-Function (Foucault)  
The idea that the "author" is not a person but a social function that
groups texts, confers authority, and establishes a mode of discourse.

Body without Organs (Deleuze)  
An impersonal field of forces, flows, and intensities that exists prior
to the organization of a unified subject or "organism."

[Death of the Author]({{ '/ai-hermeneutics/ai-kit-death-author/' | relative_url }}) (Barthes)  
Barthes’ thesis that meaning is generated in the act of reading a
"tissue of quotations," not recovered from an author's mind.

[Distanciation]({{ '/ai-hermeneutics/ai-kit-distanciation/' | relative_url }}) (Ricoeur)  
Ricoeur’s account of how writing separates discourse from its speaker
and context, enabling semantic autonomy.

Fusion of Horizons (Gadamer)  
The idea that understanding is a dialogue where the reader's worldview
and the text's historical world merge, transforming the reader.

Grammatical Rail (Schleiermacher)  
Interpretation via a text's relationship to the shared system of
language and genre. For AI, this is the analysis of the model's
architecture and training data.

Hermeneutics of Suspicion (Ricoeur)  
An interpretive style (associated with Marx, Nietzsche, Freud) that
unmasks hidden ideologies, biases, or power structures beneath a text's
surface.

Horizon of Expectations (Jauss)  
The set of cultural, ethical, and aesthetic assumptions a community of
readers brings to a text at a given historical moment.

Implied Reader (Iser)  
A role or script embedded within a text that the actual reader must
perform to make meaning. The text actively shapes its reader by creating
"gaps" to be filled.

Monstrous Monotony (Deleuze)  
The principle that monstrous, novel variation is produced by a
monotonous, repeating system. A core concept for a non-Romantic theory
of creativity.

Narratology (Genette)  
The structural analysis of narrative, focusing on elements like order,
duration, frequency, mood (focalization), and voice.

Paratext (Genette)  
The material that surrounds a main text and shapes its interpretation,
such as titles, prefaces, disclaimers, and even the user interface.

Postulate of Goodwill (Deleuze)  
The reader's assumption that the author is a "friend" who wants to be
understood clearly and honestly. Deleuze argues this is a central,
unexamined dogma of traditional thought.

Psychological Rail (Schleiermacher)  
Reconstructing an author’s singular creative act. Inapplicable to AI in
its original form, this interpretive goal is now often replaced by
reception and form diagnostics.

Reactive Forces (Deleuze/Nietzsche)  
Forces that adapt, limit, and conform. Reactive thought is defined by
what it opposes and is often animated by
[*ressentiment*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment).

Ressentiment (Nietzsche)  
The creative revenge of the weak against the strong. A reactive feeling
that inverts values by first declaring an external force "evil" to
justify itself as "good."

Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff)  
An economic logic that treats human experience as free raw material for
data extraction, analysis, and the creation of prediction products.

World of the Text (Ricoeur)  
The possible world or mode of being that a text projects in front of
itself, which the reader can inhabit through interpretation.

### Key Thinkers and Relevance

Roland Barthes
His "Death of the Author" is the theoretical starting point for reading
authorless texts.

Gilles Deleuze
Provides a radical critique of the unified subject and a philosophy of
impersonal forces, tools for analyzing AI beyond Romantic categories.

Hans-Georg Gadamer
His dialogical model of reading explains how texts can "read us" back.

Gérard Genette
Provides the essential tools of narratology and paratextual analysis for
a formal reading of AI texts.

Wolfgang Iser
His concepts of the "implied reader" and "gaps" are central to analyzing
user interaction with AI.

Hans Robert Jauss
Reception theory allows us to study the meaning of AI texts as a social
and historical phenomenon.

Paul Ricoeur
His theories of distanciation and the "world of the text" provide a
positive ethical program for reading AI.
