How does Ricoeur’s idea of *distanciation* help us read AI-generated
texts?

Paul Ricoeur’s account of **distanciation** stresses that the act of
writing detaches discourse from the speaking subject, creating a text
with *semantic autonomy*. Readers then appropriate “the world of the
text” rather than the mind of its author. AI-generated writing
radicalizes this: there may be no human speaker to detach from in the
first place.

## Why Distanciation Matters for AI

- **Autonomy:** AI outputs are already “at a distance” from any speaker;
  interpretation turns to the text’s world.
- **Application:** Understanding is completed in use—how readers apply
  the text within practices and communities.
- **Constraint:** Autonomy is not anarchy; textual structures and genres
  still constrain plausible readings.

## Working Method

1.  **Describe the world of the text:** What reality is projected?
2.  **Track paratexts (Genette):** Prompts, model cards, disclaimers,
    titles that guide appropriation.
3.  **Engage the implied reader (Iser):** Identify gaps and invited
    completions.
4.  **Situate reception (Jauss):** What horizons do readers bring? What
    shifts does the text effect?
