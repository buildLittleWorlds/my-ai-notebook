How would the great interpretive traditions respond to ChatGPT? This
page sketches key figures across hermeneutics and literary theory to
show how different methods address the challenge of texts without
authors. The aim is practical: to surface lenses you can actually use
when reading algorithmic discourse.

## The Traditionalists: Those Who Need Authors

These thinkers build their hermeneutics around reconstructing human
consciousness; authorless texts strain their methods.

### Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834): The “Father of Modern Hermeneutics”

- **Core Method:** Dual track of *grammatical* (system) and
  *psychological* (author) interpretation.
- **AI Response:** The psychological rail has no author to reconstruct.
- **Verdict:** AI texts are hermeneutically incomplete unless
  “psychology” is reconceived.

### Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911): Life-Expression and Understanding

- **Core Method:** Understand texts as *life-expressions* situated
  within lived experience.
- **AI Response:** A rupture: algorithmic sequences lack
  lived-experience origins.
- **Verdict:** AI texts gravitate toward *explanation* (Erklären) rather
  than *understanding* (Verstehen).

## The Bridge-Builders: Those Who Adapt

These approaches loosen authorial control and so adapt more readily to
authorless text.

### Augustine (354–430): The Rule of Charity

- **Core Method:** Look for intended meaning but accept unintended
  senses if they promote love and truth.
- **AI Response:** Evaluate interpretations by their ethical fruits
  rather than origin.
- **Verdict:** AI texts can be responsibly interpreted under the “rule
  of charity.”

### Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900–2002): Fusion of Horizons

- **Core Method:** Understanding as dialogue between the interpreter’s
  horizon and the text/tradition.
- **AI Response:** Dialogue with tradition embodied in training corpora
  remains possible.
- **Verdict:** Interpretable—though the dialogue may be thinner without
  a living author.

### Paul Ricoeur (1913–2005): Semantic Autonomy and Distanciation

- **Core Method:** Writing “distances” speech from author;
  interpretation concerns the *world of the text*.
- **AI Response:** AI radicalizes *distanciation*—textual autonomy
  without a speaker.
- **Verdict:** Fully interpretable; the hermeneutic task is reframed,
  not abolished.

## The Deconstructors: Those Who Celebrate Authorlessness

These figures already displaced the author, so AI looks like a
confirmation.

### Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900): Interpretation as Will

- **Core Method:** Meaning arises through interpretive imposition;
  “there are no facts, only interpretations.”
- **AI Response:** The missing author is no loss; reading becomes avowed
  creation.
- **Verdict:** AI makes explicit what interpretation always did.

### Martin Heidegger (1889–1976): Language Speaks

- **Core Method:** Language discloses being beyond individual intent;
  danger of technologized “idle talk.”
- **AI Response:** Diagnose AI discourse as part of *Gestell*
  (enframing); interpret the phenomenon.
- **Verdict:** Interpretable as a historical symptom of our
  technological condition.

### Jacques Derrida (1930–2004): Iterability and the Play of Signifiers

- **Core Method:** Writing functions in the radical absence of
  sender/receiver; meaning is differential play.
- **AI Response:** A vivid case: iterable marks without presence.
- **Verdict:** AI texts show how writing always already worked.

## The Readers & Form: Reception and Narratology

These literary theorists relocate meaning to readers and textual form,
lenses for authorless or multi-authored discourse.

### Hans Robert Jauss (1921–1997): Reception Aesthetics & Horizon of Expectations

- **Core Method:** Reconstruct the historical reader’s *horizon of
  expectations*; write literary history via changing receptions.
- **AI Response:** Treat AI outputs as reception events; measure novelty
  and “aesthetic distance” by how publics adjust their horizons.
- **Verdict:** Significance emerges in reception—how communities
  evaluate, appropriate, and normalize machine text.

### Wolfgang Iser (1926–2007): Implied Reader, Gaps, Concretization

- **Core Method:** Texts contain *gaps* (Leerstellen) that invite an
  *implied reader* to complete them in reading.
- **AI Response:** Many AI texts foreground scaffolds and omissions;
  interpretation hinges on how the text guides reader completion.
- **Verdict:** Judge AI writing by how productively it organizes blanks
  and cues toward coherent “concretizations.”

### Gérard Genette (1930–2018): Narrative Discourse & Paratexts

- **Core Method:** Analyze narrative *order*, *duration*, *frequency*
  (time), *mood* (incl. focalization), *voice*; treat paratexts (titles,
  prompts, disclaimers, system notes) as thresholds that steer reading.
- **AI Response:** Apply these categories to machine discourse; read
  prompts/model cards/safety banners as paratexts shaping
  interpretation.
- **Verdict:** Narrative and paratextual structure give robust levers
  for close reading, author or no author.

## The Pattern That Emerges

- **Author-Centric Hermeneutics** face a real strain with AI texts.
- **Text-/Form-Centric Approaches** analyze structure and paratext
  regardless of authorship.
- **Reader-Centric Approaches** are vindicated by AI’s emphasis on
  audience uptake.
