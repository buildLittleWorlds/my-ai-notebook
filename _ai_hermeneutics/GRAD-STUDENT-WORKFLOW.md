# Graduate Student Workflow — AI Hermeneutics Kit

## Quick Overview

**AI Hermeneutics Kit** is a **systematic theoretical framework** (out-of-character) for interpreting AI-generated texts. You're building academic theory that adapts traditional hermeneutics for algorithmic authorship challenges.

### Key Principle:
This is **cutting-edge theory-building** — systematic frameworks that address interpretive challenges posed by AI texts, grounded in established critical theory but responsive to new conditions.

---

## Step 1: Identify Your Content Type

### What Belongs in AI Hermeneutics Kit:
- **Interpretive frameworks**: Methods for reading AI-generated texts
- **Theoretical adaptations**: How traditional hermeneutics applies to algorithmic authorship
- **Critical theory applications**: Foucault, Deleuze, Butler, etc. adapted for AI contexts
- **Practical methods**: Tools for actual AI text analysis
- **Cross-theoretical synthesis**: Integration of diverse critical approaches

### What Does NOT Belong Here:
- Work-in-progress reflections (those go in `_posts/`)
- Romanticism-specific methods (those go in `_romantic/`)
- Fictional AI examples from Densworld (keep theory collections non-fictional)

---

## Step 2: Choose Your Theoretical Framework

### Kit Voice Markers:
- **Systematic and rigorous**: Building coherent analytical frameworks

1. **Theoretical Foundation**: Which critical theory you're adapting/applying
2. **AI Application**: How this applies specifically to AI-generated texts
3. **Interpretive Method**: Practical steps for analysis

- **Link to all component pages** with brief descriptions
- **Explain integration** between different theoretical approaches

---

## Step 5: Core Theoretical Arguments

### Central Thesis:
AI interpretive challenges are **intensifications** of existing hermeneutical questions, not entirely new problems. Traditional critical theory provides applicable frameworks when properly adapted.

### Key Theoretical Positions:

#### Author-Function Analysis:
- Move **from Romantic soul to algorithmic system**
- **Retain Foucault's insights** about author as function, not person
- **Adapt for distributed/algorithmic authorship**

#### Interpretive Dialogue Theory:
- **Gadamerian dialogue** adapted for AI contexts
- **Risk and transformation** in human-AI interpretive encounters
- **Horizon fusion** between human and algorithmic perspectives

#### Machine Theory Applications:
- **Deleuzian machine analysis** applied to AI text production
- **Assemblage theory** for human-AI interpretive systems
- **Force analysis**: Active vs. reactive textual production

---

## Step 6: Critical Theory Integration

### Source Theorists and Key Adaptations:

#### Michel Foucault:
- **Author-function**: From historical author to algorithmic system
- **Genealogy**: Tracing the formation of AI discourse
- **Power/knowledge**: How AI texts participate in knowledge formation

#### Hans-Georg Gadamer:
- **Interpretive dialogue**: Human-AI hermeneutic encounters
- **Horizon fusion**: Merging human and algorithmic interpretive frameworks
- **Risk**: New forms of textual danger and transformation

#### Gilles Deleuze & Félix Guattari:
- **Desiring-machines**: AI as textual production machine
- **Assemblages**: Human-AI interpretive assemblages
- **Forces**: Active vs. reactive analysis of AI production

#### Judith Butler:
- **Performativity**: AI as performative subject without interiority
- **Regulatory fictions**: Coherent authorship as control mechanism
- **Parody**: AI as copy without original

## Step 7: Content Development Process

### Research Phase:
1. **Primary theory**: Deep engagement with source theorists
2. **AI text examples**: Actual AI-generated texts for analysis
3. **Contemporary scholarship**: Current AI and digital humanities work
4. **Cross-theoretical connections**: How different approaches integrate

### Adaptation Phase:
1. **Identify core insights**: What from traditional theory applies?
2. **Locate new challenges**: Where does AI break traditional frameworks?
3. **Develop modifications**: How to adapt theory for AI contexts?
4. **Test applications**: Does this work on actual AI texts?

### Systematization Phase:
1. **Create coherent method**: Step-by-step interpretive process
2. **Cross-reference frameworks**: How do different approaches connect?
3. **Build comprehensive system**: Integrated theoretical toolkit
4. **Validate through application**: Test on diverse AI texts

- Blog posts **explore** AI interpretive challenges that get **systematized** in kit
- Use kit pages to **formalize** theoretical insights from experimental reading

#### AI Hermeneutics Kit ↔ Romantic Kit:
- **Some principles adapt** between traditional and AI texts
- **Others require fundamental reconceptualization**
- **Cross-reference** where traditional methods inform AI interpretation

#### Theory Collections ≠ Fictional Collections:

4. **Build practical methods** — usable interpretive techniques

### Advanced Development:
1. **Specific AI technology applications** — how different AI systems require different approaches
2. **Historical development** — genealogy of AI text interpretation
3. **Comparative analysis** — AI vs. other forms of mediated authorship
4. **Contemporary debates** — engagement with current digital humanities discussions

### Cross-System Applications:
1. **Connect to blog exploration** — formalize experimental insights
2. **Link to Romantic methods** — show adaptation and difference
3. **Ground fictional work** — theoretical principles behind creative applications

## Step 12: Example Page Development

### Sample Page: `ai-kit-deleuze-assemblage.md`

```yaml
---
layout: kit
title: "The Human-AI Assemblage: A New Desiring-Machine"

---
```

**Content Structure:**
1. **Deleuzian foundation**: Assemblage theory and desiring-machines
2. **AI application**: How human-AI interaction forms new assemblages
3. **Interpretive method**: Reading AI texts as assemblage products
4. **Contemporary examples**: Analysis of actual AI text generation
5. **Cross-references**: Connections to other Deleuzian frameworks and non-Deleuzian approaches
6. **Practical application**: Step-by-step analytical process

This systematic approach ensures the AI Hermeneutics Kit provides **cutting-edge theoretical tools** for addressing the genuine interpretive challenges posed by AI-generated texts, while remaining grounded in established critical theory traditions.
