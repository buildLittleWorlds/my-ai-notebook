# Graduate Student Workflow — AI Hermeneutics Kit

## Quick overview (what you’re making)

You’re writing **systematic theory pages** that adapt critical frameworks for **AI text interpretation**—rigorous, practical, and cross-linked (not exploratory posts; not fiction)  .

---

## Step 0 — Place your work correctly

**Belongs in AI Hermeneutics**

* Interpretive frameworks, theoretical adaptations, practical methods, and cross-theory syntheses .

**Does *not* belong here**

* WIP reflections → `_posts/`
* Romantic-specific methods → `_romantic/`
* Any **fictionalized** examples → keep fiction out of theory collections .

---

## Step 1 — Pick your page type

* **Foundations** (Author-function; Dialogue; Risk) .
* **Deleuzian / Butlerian / Additional Frameworks** (machine/assemblage/forces; performativity/interiority/parody/regulation; genealogy/distanciation/death-of-the-author) .

Write in **kit voice**: systematic, rigorous, practical, cross-disciplinary .

---

## Step 2 — Outline with the standard template (+ the Addendum)

Build your draft with these six parts:

1. **Theoretical Foundation**
2. **AI Application**
3. **Interpretive Method** (actionable steps)
4. **Contemporary Relevance**
5. **Cross-References** (link related kit pages)&#x20;
   **6) Densworld Addendum (seed)** — 2–4 sentences, out-of-character; see Step 6.

---

## Step 3 — Draft the core analysis

Make the **method** usable: show the diagnostic moves (e.g., reception gaps, implied reader, paratext thresholds) and how they apply to concrete AI outputs .

---

## Step 4 — Technical specs (files, front matter, nav)

**Naming**

```
ai-kit-[topic].md
ai-kit-[theorist]-[concept].md
ai-hermeneutics-kit.md  (hub)
```



**Front matter**

```yaml
---
layout: kit
title: "Page Title with Subtitle"
kit_type: ai_hermeneutics
---
```



**Location**: `_ai_hermeneutics/your-filename.md` .
**Top nav pill** (add to top of every page): see hub’s “← Back to AI Hermeneutics Kit” pill .

---

## Step 5 — Cross-linking (wire the kit together)

* Link back to the **hub** and across related frameworks using `relative_url` .
* Model link text on:
  `…see [Author-function](/ai-hermeneutics/ai-kit-author-function/) and [Paratexts](/ai-hermeneutics/ai-kit-genealogy/)…`  .

## Step 6 — The **Densworld Addendum (seed)** (short, required)

Every page ends with a **tiny non-fictional seed** that connects your theory to either the Archive or Debate system. Choose the path that best fits your framework—concrete scenarios suggest Archive entries; methodological questions suggest Debate documents.

**Choose Your Connection Path:**

### Option A: Archive Connection
When your theory suggests **concrete Densworld scenarios, devices, or practices**:
* A **concrete image/device/practice** your theory suggests
* A **proposed Order** and **likely Region** (canonical lists below)

### Option B: Debate Connection  
When your theory suggests **interpretive methodology questions or archival policy issues**:
* A concrete archival methodology problem your theory raises
* A likely **Phase** (Phase I-IV of archival development)  
* A likely **Document Type** and **Archivist Temperament** (canonical lists below)

**Template snippets**:

```markdown
### Densworld Addendum (seed) — Archive Focus
**Order:** [Boundary | Doubling | Craving | Silence & Withdrawal | Violence & Secret Life | Mediation & Aperture]  
**Region:** [Capital | Dens/Densmok | Quarry | North/Northo | Tower/Sticks | Dead River | Capeast]

[2-4 sentences describing the concrete scenario/device your theory suggests]

### Densworld Addendum (seed) — Debate Focus  
**Phase:** [Phase I | Phase II | Phase III | Phase IV]  
**Document Type:** [memo | minute | field report | hearing | counter-memo | directive | ruling | brief | case note | colloquy note]  
**Likely Temperament:** [Clerkly | Romantic | Philosophical]

[2-4 sentences describing the methodological question or policy debate your theory suggests]
```

## Step 7 — Final polish & submission checklist

* ✅ **Right section** (AI kit, not post/Romantic/fiction)&#x20;
* ✅ **Front matter + filename + location** match specs &#x20;
* ✅ **Back-to-hub pill** present&#x20;
* ✅ **Six-part structure** (Foundation → AI → Method → Relevance → Cross-Refs → **Addendum**)&#x20;
* ✅ **Cross-links** to the hub and at least 2 related kit pages&#x20;
* ✅ **Addendum seed** follows either Archive format (Order + Region) or Debate format (Phase + Doc Type + Temperament)
