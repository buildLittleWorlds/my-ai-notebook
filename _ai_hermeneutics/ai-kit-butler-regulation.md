Why do we demand that a text have a single, coherent author behind it?
The Romantic answer is that this author is the source of the text's
authentic meaning. Foucault, with his concept of the
[author-function]({{ '/ai-hermeneutics/ai-kit-author-function/' | relative_url }}), suggests it's a way to
classify and control discourse. Judith Butler lays out a third,
complementary view: the coherent subject is a "regulatory fiction," a
social norm we are compelled to perform to be seen as intelligible.

## Identity as a Compulsory Performance

Butler argues that "gender reality is created through sustained social
performances." The idea that we have a stable, unified identity is not a
description of a pre-existing fact, but an ideal we are forced to
approximate. This "true or abiding masculinity or femininity" is a
"regulatory fiction," a story our culture tells about what a coherent
person looks like. We are punished for failing to perform this
coherence.

This fiction works by "conceal\[ing\] gender’s performative character."
It makes us believe our identity is an essence, not an act, thus making
the social rules that produce it seem natural and inevitable.

## The AI that Performs Coherence

This lens allows us to analyze the "author-function" of AI in a new
light. An LLM is, by its nature, a fragmented, statistical system with
no unified consciousness. Yet, through techniques like Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it is explicitly trained to perform
the role of a coherent, singular, and helpful authorial persona.

The AI's "personality" is the ultimate regulatory fiction. It is a
carefully constructed performance designed to make its output socially
and commercially intelligible. It does not have an identity; it performs
one according to a set of rules.

- **The Romantic Demand:** A text must come from a unified, authentic
  soul.
- **The Butlerian Analysis:** The "unified, authentic soul" is a
  regulatory norm. AI's ability to simulate it on demand reveals that
  this norm is a set of learnable, performable conventions.

AI doesn't just challenge our idea of who can be an author. It exposes
the "coherent author" as an important regulatory fictions of our
culture. It is a role we have been trained to perform, and one that a
machine can now be trained to perform as well. By simulating the author,
the AI unmasks the social regulations that produced the human author in
the first place.
