    <h1>The Copy of a Copy: AI, Parody, and the End of the Original</h1>
    <p>A central tenet of Romanticism is the cult of originality. The authentic artist creates something new, born from a singular vision. A common critique of AI is that it cannot be truly creative because it is purely derivative; it only remixes its training data. Ted Chiang’s metaphor of the <a href="post37.html">"blurry jpeg of the web"</a> captures this feeling. But Judith Butler’s analysis of parody suggests that the "original" itself is a myth.</p>

      <h2>Parody and the Imitation Without an Origin</h2>
      <p>Butler uses the example of drag to make a profound point about identity. Drag is not a simple imitation of a "real" gender. Instead, it reveals the imitative structure of all gender. The "original" gender that we think of as natural is itself a performance, a set of repeated acts that conform to a social norm.</p>
      <p>So Butler argues, "gender parody reveals that the original identity after which gender fashions itself is an imitation without an origin." The parody doesn't copy the original; it reveals the original to have been a copy all along.</p>

      <h2>AI as the Ultimate Parodic Machine</h2>
      <p>This provides a heuristic for rethinking AI's relationship to creativity. An LLM, trained on nearly the entire internet, is the ultimate "imitation without an origin." It is a machine designed to produce a copy of a copy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Romantic Critique:</strong> AI is not original. It is a derivative collage of human-made content.</li>
        <li><strong>The Butlerian Re-reading:</strong> AI's derivativeness is not its weakness but its most revealing feature. By being a "blurry jpeg of the web," it exposes the fact that human culture is also a vast, intertextual web of imitation and repetition. The "original" human author we venerate is also weaving together a "tissue of quotations" (to borrow from Barthes).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The AI, in its structure, performs a parody of originality. It demonstrates that creativity is not about conjuring something from nothing, but about the skillful re-combination and re-contextualization of existing forms. The machine doesn't fail to be an original author. It reveals originality itself to be a regulatory fiction, a myth we tell ourselves to conceal the imitative and collective nature of all creation.</p>
