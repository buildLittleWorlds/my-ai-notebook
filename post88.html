            <h2>88 A Quick Note: Adichie and the Deep Opt-In</h2>
            <p>Just a quick thought on the <a href="post63.html">"deep opt-in"</a> framework. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's essay <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Should_All_Be_Feminists">"We Should All Be Feminists"</a> is different kind of deep-opting-in.</p>
            
            <p>Here's a quote:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                Culture does not make people. People make culture.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This is the entire philosophy of the deep opt-in in a single sentence. It is a declaration of human agency and a rejection of the idea that the systems we live in are external, alien forces. If we make the culture, then we have both the power and the responsibility to remake it. It is an argument against withdrawal and against passive acceptance.</p>
            
            <p>Her title makes this a <em>collective</em> imperative. "We Should <em>All</em> Be Feminists" is not a personal choice; it's a call for everyone to participate in the work. It is the opposite of the <a href="post63.html">"deep opt-out"</a> that seeks purity in withdrawal. It is a command to stay and do the work.</p>
            
            <p>More to come.</p>
