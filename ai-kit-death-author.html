    <h1>The Death of the Author (From Theory to Reality)</h1>

    <p>In 1967, Roland Barthes declared the "death of the author" as a theoretical move to liberate interpretation from authorial tyranny. He argued that meaning belonged to the reader and the play of language, not to the author's biography or intentions. Fifty years later, AI texts make this metaphor literal: there is, quite simply, no human author to die.</p>

    <h2>From Barthes to ChatGPT</h2>
    <p>Barthes' famous essay challenged the Romantic tradition that treated texts as expressions of their authors' souls. He argued that writing is "the destruction of every voice, of every point of origin." The writer's only power is "to mix writings, to counter the ones with the others."</p>

    <h3>What AI Changes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Metaphor Becomes Literal:</strong> Barthes spoke metaphorically; AI makes it concrete</li>
      <li><strong>No Biographical Fallacy:</strong> There's no author's life to mistakenly reference</li>
      <li><strong>Pure "Tissue of Quotations":</strong> AI texts are literally assemblages of prior discourse</li>
      <li><strong>The Reader Triumphant:</strong> With no author to defer to, interpretation becomes entirely reader-driven</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Hermeneutic Liberation</h2>
    <p>AI texts offer an extreme test case for post-authorial hermeneutics. They force us to answer: Can meaning exist without intentional consciousness behind it?</p>

    <h3>Three Theoretical Positions</h3>

    <h4>1. The Purists (Meaning Requires Consciousness)</h4>
    <p>Followers of Schleiermacher and Betti argue that without an author's mind, there's no real meaning to interpret—only patterns to analyze. An AI poem might be formally correct but semantically empty.</p>

    <h4>2. The Structuralists (Meaning Lives in Language)</h4>
    <p>Following Barthes and Derrida, this camp argues that meaning was never dependent on authorial consciousness anyway. Language itself generates meaning through its own systemic operations.</p>

    <h4>3. The Pragmatists (Meaning Emerges in Use)</h4>
    <p>This position holds that meaning arises from how texts function in specific contexts. If an AI text moves readers, teaches them, or changes their thinking, it has meaning regardless of its origin.</p>

    <h2>What Happens to Intentionality?</h2>
    <p>Traditional hermeneutics assumed that texts express intentions. AI texts have no intentions in the human sense, but they do have something analogous.</p>

    <h3>Types of AI "Intention"</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Programmer Intention:</strong> The goals built into the model's design</li>
      <li><strong>Prompt Intention:</strong> The user's intended direction</li>
      <li><strong>Emergent Intention:</strong> Patterns that arise from the model's training</li>
      <li><strong>Functional Intention:</strong> What the text "wants" to accomplish in context</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reading Without the Author</h2>
    <p>If the author is truly dead, interpretation must focus elsewhere:</p>

    <h3>Focus on the Text Itself</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Analyze linguistic patterns and structures</li>
      <li>Trace internal contradictions and tensions</li>
      <li>Map the text's relationship to genre conventions</li>
      <li>Examine how meaning emerges from formal choices</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Focus on Cultural Context</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What cultural moment does this text reflect?</li>
      <li>What ideologies are embedded in its language?</li>
      <li>How does it participate in ongoing cultural conversations?</li>
      <li>What does it reveal about the society that created the training data?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Focus on Reader Response</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How does the text affect different readers?</li>
      <li>What interpretive communities form around it?</li>
      <li>How does it function in various social contexts?</li>
      <li>What new meanings emerge through use?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The New Hermeneutic Situation</h2>
    <p>AI texts create what we might call a "post-authorial hermeneutic situation." This isn't necessarily a loss—it might be a clarification. It forces us to acknowledge what was always true: interpretation is a creative, constructive act, not just a recovery operation.</p>

    <h3>Implications for Reading</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interpretive Responsibility:</strong> Readers bear full responsibility for meaning-making</li>
      <li><strong>Ethical Dimension:</strong> Without authorial intention as a guide, ethical frameworks become crucial</li>
      <li><strong>Creative Interpretation:</strong> Reading becomes more openly creative and constructive</li>
      <li><strong>Contextual Sensitivity:</strong> The situation of reading becomes paramount</li>
    </ul>
