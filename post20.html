            <h2>20 Propaganda and the outsider</h2>
            <p>We think of propaganda as a blunt instrument for the masses. It hammers home a simple message for the majority. So, what about the people on the margins? The people who are ignored or harmed by those simple messages?</p>
            <p>The work of scholars like Kimberl√© Crenshaw shows how systems can be blind to people who are "multiply burdened," like Black women. Their specific experience is ignored. Ellul would see this not as a moral failure, but as a technical one. A failure of propaganda.</p>
            
            <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
                <p>One cannot make just any propaganda any place for anybody. Methods and arguments must be tailored to the type of man to be reached.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This is the key. Crude, biased propaganda is inefficient because it fails to "reach" everyone. It creates outsiders who can form a real opposition. A truly effective system needs to understand the exact sociological conditions of every single person to integrate them.</p>
            <p>This is the terrible irony. The just and necessary work of identifying the blind spots in our systems provides the very data needed to perfect those systems. An AI that understands intersectionality is an AI that can create perfectly "tailored" propaganda for every marginalized group. It can address their specific grievances, affirm their unique identity, and integrate them more completely than any crude, biased system ever could. It creates a propaganda with no outsiders.</p>
