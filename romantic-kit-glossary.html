    <h1>Glossary & Key Concepts</h1>
    <p>Use this as a quick reference. Each linked term connects to its dedicated page for a more rigorous explanation.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Authorial Intention</dt>
      <dd>In Romantic hermeneutics, not the author's private feelings, but the organizing principle and unique style of a work. It is something the interpreter <strong>reconstructs</strong> through textual evidence using the two-rail method.</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-authenticity.html">Authenticity</a></dt>
      <dd>A demonstrable quality of a work that expresses a singular vision rather than imitating external models. It is evidenced by a unique and coherent style that unites form and content.</dd>
      
      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-hermeneutics.html">Bildungsroman / Crisis-Autobiography</a></dt>
      <dd>German for "formation-story." A narrative that traces the protagonist's psychological and moral development, often through a spiritual crisis. For Romantics, this became a primary genre, as in Wordsworth's <em>The Prelude</em>, where the story of the poet's own life becomes an exemplary journey of self-creation.</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-organic-form.html">Circuitous Journey</a></dt>
      <dd>A central Romantic plot, identified by M. H. Abrams, in which the protagonist moves from a state of primal unity, through a painful fall into alienation and division, toward a final return to a higher, more complex and self-aware state of integration. This journey is often described as a spiral or an ascending circle.</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-contexts-germany.html">Fragment</a></dt>
      <dd>A literary form, central to German Romanticism, that presents insights as intentionally incomplete or aphoristic. It values the provocative and open-ended over the closed, systematic treatise.</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-hermeneutics.html">Grammatical / Psychological Rails</a></dt>
      <dd>Schleiermacher’s two necessary lines of inquiry for interpretation: the <strong>grammatical</strong> (analyzing the shared system of language and genre) and the <strong>psychological</strong> (reconstructing the author's singular pattern of choices).</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-hermeneutics.html">Hermeneutic Circle</a></dt>
      <dd>The iterative process of understanding where the meaning of the parts informs the whole, and the evolving sense of the whole refines the meaning of the parts.</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-contexts-england.html">Imagination vs. Fancy</a></dt>
      <dd>Coleridge's crucial distinction. <strong>Imagination</strong> is the vital, creative power that unifies and shapes material into an organic whole. <strong>Fancy</strong> is a lesser, mechanical faculty that simply recombines existing elements without transforming them.</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-technology-machine.html">The Machine (Metaphor)</a></dt>
      <dd>A metaphor for any system (industrial, social, aesthetic) that feels rigid, impersonal, and dehumanizing. The central counter-concept to the <strong>organic</strong>.</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-organic-form.html">Mechanical Form</a></dt>
      <dd>For Coleridge, a form imposed on material from the outside, like a mold. It is the direct opposite of <strong>Organic Form</strong>. It follows pre-set rules and is associated with "Fancy."</dd>
      
      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-contexts-germany.html">Mischgedicht</a></dt>
      <dd>(German: 'mixed poem/genre'). A term central to Friedrich Schlegel's theory, describing the <em>Roman</em> as a genre that intentionally fuses different forms (epic, lyric, dramatic) and modes (poetry, prose, criticism). It is the structural basis of "progressive universal poetry."</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-technology-machine.html">Natural Supernaturalism</a></dt>
      <dd>A phrase from Carlyle’s <em>Sartor Resartus</em> that M. H. Abrams used to describe the Romantic secularization of inherited theological patterns (fall, redemption, apocalypse) into a worldview grounded in mind and nature.</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-organic-form.html">Naturphilosophie</a></dt>
      <dd>A movement in German Idealism that viewed nature as a single, dynamic, self-organizing organism, providing the philosophical basis for the theory of organic form.</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-organic-form.html">Organic Form</a></dt>
      <dd>The principle that a work’s form should grow from its inner idea, like a plant from a seed. It is shaped by the creative "Imagination."</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-contexts-germany.html">Progressive Universalpoesie (Progressive Universal Poetry)</a></dt>
      <dd>Friedrich Schlegel's term for the ultimate goal of Romantic art. It was not just an abstract idea but was specifically embodied in the genre of the <em>Roman</em>, which he saw as a 'Mischgedicht' capable of endlessly combining all forms of art and knowledge.</dd>
      
      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-contexts-germany.html">Roman (Schlegelian)</a></dt>
      <dd>For Friedrich Schlegel, not just the modern novel, but the central, all-encompassing genre of modern (i.e., post-classical) art. Following Herder, he included medieval romances, the works of Dante, Cervantes, and even Shakespeare's plays under this term. The <em>Roman</em> was the vehicle for "progressive universal poetry" and the highest form of <em>romantische Poesie</em>.</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-hermeneutics.html">Romantic Hermeneutics</a></dt>
      <dd>The methodical art of interpretation, based on the premise that misunderstanding is the norm. It uses the hermeneutic circle and the two rails to reconstruct a work's meaning.</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-contexts-germany.html">Romantic Irony</a></dt>
      <dd>A mode of writing, central to German Romanticism, where a work demonstrates self-awareness of its own constructedness. It signals the artist's freedom over their material.</dd>
      
      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-authenticity.html">The 'Self' (Subjectivity)</a></dt>
      <dd>For the Romantics, the inner life of the individual—consciousness, emotion, memory, and vision—which they elevated as the primary source of truth and the proper subject of art.</dd>

      <dt>The Sublime</dt>
      <dd>An aesthetic experience of awe, terror, and vastness that overwhelms rational understanding. It was contrasted with the Beautiful (which is calm, orderly, and pleasing). The Sublime is often found in wild, untamed nature.</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-authenticity.html">Theodicy (Secular / Private)</a></dt>
      <dd>Traditionally a justification of God's goodness in the face of evil. The Romantics adapted this into a secular project, attempting to justify the existence of suffering and loss in an individual's life by showing it was necessary for the growth of the mind and the achievement of a higher consciousness.</dd>

      <dt><a href="romantic-kit-contexts-germany.html">Volksgeist</a></dt>
      <dd>Literally, "spirit of the people." Herder's idea that each nation or culture has its own unique character, language, and creative genius, which is the source of its authentic art (e.g., folk tales, ballads).</dd>
