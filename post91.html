            <h2>91 The Paradox of Mere Exposure: Stolzenberg and the <em>Mozert</em> Case</h2>

            <p>The <a href="post90.html">last post</a> introduced Stephen Macedo's argument for a civic "deep opt-in," a stance that justifies certain compulsory aspects of public education as necessary for creating citizens. This argument hinges on cases like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozert_v._Hawkins"><em>Mozert v. Hawkins County Board of Education</em></a>, where fundamentalist Christian families sought to opt their children out of a reading program they found objectionable. To understand the depth of this conflict, we need to move past a surface-level reading of the case. The scholar Nomi Maya Stolzenberg, in her groundbreaking article, “‘He Drew a Circle That Shut Me Out’: Assimilation, Indoctrination, and the Paradox of a Liberal Education,” argues that the fundamentalist complaint is far more than a simple objection to offensive content; it is a coherent critique of the core assumptions of liberal society.</p>

            <p>The facts of <em>Mozert</em> seem straightforward: in 1983, families in Tennessee argued that the Holt Basic reading series violated their free exercise of religion by exposing their children to ideas contrary to their beliefs, such as evolution, feminism, and religious relativism. The liberal defense, and the ultimate position of the courts, was that "mere exposure" to diverse ideas is not a constitutional harm. Because the school was not compelling the students to believe anything, it was seen as a neutral act that left the students free to choose their own values.</p>

            <p>Stolzenberg’s insight is that this defense misses the entire point of the fundamentalist objection. For the parents in <em>Mozert</em>, the harm was not that their children were being forced to recite a creed they rejected. The harm was the "objective" method itself.</p>

            <blockquote>
                The fundamentalists' assault goes far beyond their now-familiar resistance to evolutionary theory and sex education. In several recent suits, they have asserted that the teaching of diverse viewpoints in a tolerant and objective mode threatens the survival of their culture.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This is the paradox. The school’s "tolerant and objective mode" of teaching (presenting different religions, cultures, and values as interesting options in a marketplace of ideas) is the actual mechanism of assimilation. It takes the fundamentalists' understanding of their faith as objective, revealed Truth and reframes it as one subjective "belief system" among many. It forces the child to adopt a critical, detached posture toward their own inherited worldview. In Stolzenberg's analysis, this is not neutrality; it is active indoctrination into the specific culture of liberal, secular humanism. The freedom to choose one's own lifestyle is precisely the "injurious violation" the fundamentalists were trying to prevent.</p>

            <p>What makes Stolzenberg's argument really intriguing is her demonstration that this critique of liberalism's false neutrality is not unique to the religious right. In fact, it shares a deep structural similarity with arguments from the academic left.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                In a similar vein, some feminists have assailed gender-neutrality and argued that basic liberal institutions are egalitarian in ways that reflect distinctively male values... The new "critical race theory"... criticizes the hegemonic function of seemingly neutral principles...
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Stolzenberg points out that when critical race theorists argue that a "color-blind" legal system is not neutral but actually enforces white, hegemonic norms, they are making the same kind of argument as the <em>Mozert</em> plaintiffs. The same is true for feminist critiques of supposedly neutral principles that are, in fact, based on male experience. In both cases, the core claim is that a system pretending to be universal and objective is actually imposing the values of the dominant culture and assimilating those outside of it.</p>
            
            <p>This creates an uncomfortable and unacknowledged alliance. The academic left would never see itself as an ally of Christian fundamentalists, yet both groups are engaged in a similar project: unmasking the hidden, coercive power of a liberal order that claims to be neutral. Stolzenberg’s work forces us to take the fundamentalist opt-out seriously, not as an act of religious intolerance but as a coherent critique of the invisible architecture of typical liberal societies.</p>
