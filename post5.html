            <h2>5 Nietzsche contra AI</h2>
            <p>I don't know why I care what Nietzsche might have thought about AI. Actually, I do. One thing I care a lot about is writing that's not standardized. This is why it probably makes more sense for me to really dislike the current batch of AI tools. The writing, the art, the plastic blob.</p>
            <p>And Nietzsche would hate blobby writing and art and thinking too. So it seems obvious he would hate AI. Nietzsche's writing is a miracle. It has insight and it's not plastic or dry like academic papers. So he certainly would have hated plastic AI writing, right?</p>
            <p>I have a little suspicion that Nietzsche would be as interested to fiddle around with AI as I am. I'd like to expand that into a bigger suspicion.</p>
