            <h2>49 Just a kid like everyone else</h2>
            <p>Another reading of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg">"Hero"</a>. This one is less about aesthetic systems and more about psychology. It's about this one line: "But I'm a kid like everyone else." It's a pyschological dodge. It sounds vulnerable and authentic but it's just a self-protective dodge.</p>

            <p>The statement is, on its face, false. The man in the video is not a kid. He is a father, a man with visible responsibilities and a history that includes a former partner and a child. To claim the status of a "kid" in this context is deflection. It's a refusal to take on burdens. By identifying with adolescence, he absolves himself of the expectations placed on an adult: stability, presence, sacrificing personal desires for the good of others. The line "I don't wanna be your hero" isn't some sort of deep rejection of that bullshit ideal of heroism everyone knows is made-up anyway. It's just a personal refusal with quite a bit of cowardice mixed in: "I don't want to take on the responsibilities that come with being <em>your</em> hero."</p>
            
            <p>The video provides a quick visual for this interpretation. At the 0:51 mark, we see him riding a shopping cart in the grocery parking lot. It's a moment of performative immaturity. It's a fun and carefree image because it contrasts with the adult realities of his life. It's also a simple visual echo of the rodeo. (Is this just some guy who really likes to ride things?) Is the rodeo an escape into a world where he can live out a built-in childhood fantasy? The rodeo offers a simpler, more dramatic form of heroism (a few seconds of intense bravery) than the sustained, mundane, and thankless heroism of being a present and reliable father.</p>

            <p>From this perspective, the song's title becomes deeply ironic. The "hero" is a persona he adopts in the arena precisely to avoid the more difficult work of being a father. The entire song can be heard as his justification for this choice, an anthem for the allure of perpetual adolescence. Framed as a simple pursuit of personal freedom, being a kid like everyone else is what prevents him from being what his daughter likely needs him to be. Yes, actually, not a "big man," not a rodeo star. The title says what she would unironically want.</p>
