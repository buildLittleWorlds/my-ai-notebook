    <h1>Glossary & Key Concepts</h1>
    <p>Essential terms for AI hermeneutics. Each entry gives a crisp definition plus a <em>why it matters for AI texts</em> note so readers can immediately apply it in practice.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Absolute Distanciation <span class="small">(editor’s term)</span></dt>
      <dd>Shorthand for the extreme textual distance of AI outputs: unlike human writing (which becomes autonomous through inscription), AI texts begin without an originating consciousness.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It justifies author-agnostic reading methods that focus on form, reception, and the text's projected world.</p>

      <dt>Appropriation</dt>
      <dd>In Ricoeur's hermeneutics, the reader’s act of making the meaning of a text one’s own.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> With no human intention to recover, well-argued appropriation becomes the ethical goal of interpretation.</p>

      <dt>Author-Function (Foucault)</dt>
      <dd>The idea that the "author" is not a person but a social function that groups texts, confers authority, and establishes a mode of discourse.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Allows us to analyze how a model like GPT-4 functions *as an author* without having to claim it is a person.</p>

      <dt>Cyborg Text</dt>
      <dd>Borrowing from Donna Haraway, a text co-produced by human and machine (e.g., via prompting and editing), requiring hybrid interpretive strategies.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Reminds us that much "AI writing" is a human-machine collaboration.</p>

      <dt><a href="ai-kit-death-author.html">Death of the Author</a> (Barthes)</dt>
      <dd>Barthes’ thesis that meaning is generated in the act of reading a "tissue of quotations," not recovered from an author's mind.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> AI texts, trained on vast corpora, are a literal "tissue of quotations," making them a prime object for post-authorial reading.</p>

      <dt><a href="ai-kit-distanciation.html">Distanciation</a> (Ricoeur)</dt>
      <dd>Ricoeur’s account of how writing separates discourse from its speaker and context, enabling semantic autonomy.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Provides the philosophical justification for evaluating AI texts by their structure and projected world, not by a missing psyche.</p>

      <dt>Fusion of Horizons (Gadamer)</dt>
      <dd>The idea that understanding is a dialogue where the reader's worldview and the text's historical world merge, transforming the reader.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Frames the concept of being "read by a book" as a transformative event, providing a baseline for analyzing the new risks of being "read by an AI."</p>

      <dt>Grammatical Rail (Schleiermacher)</dt>
      <dd>Interpretation via a text's relationship to the shared system of language and genre. For AI, this is the analysis of the model's architecture and training data.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> A foundational part of any reading, but insufficient without its counterpart. Modern methods often replace the "psychological rail" with form and reception analysis.</p>

      <dt>Hermeneutics of Suspicion (Ricoeur)</dt>
      <dd>An interpretive style (associated with Marx, Nietzsche, Freud) that unmasks hidden ideologies, biases, or power structures beneath a text's surface.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The essential stance for analyzing hidden biases in training data and the potential for AI texts to function as propaganda.</p>

      <dt>Horizon of Expectations (Jauss)</dt>
      <dd>The set of cultural, ethical, and aesthetic assumptions a community of readers brings to a text at a given historical moment.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Allows us to measure the "aesthetic distance" of an AI text—does it merely conform to expectations, or does it challenge and change them?</p>

      <dt>Implied Reader (Iser)</dt>
      <dd>A role or script embedded within a text that the actual reader must perform to make meaning. The text actively shapes its reader by creating "gaps" to be filled.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Provides a precise tool for analyzing how an AI text guides and constrains the user's interpretation, independent of any authorial intent.</p>

      <dt>Narratology (Genette)</dt>
      <dd>The structural analysis of narrative, focusing on elements like order, duration, frequency, mood (focalization), and voice.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Offers a rigorous, objective method for analyzing the formal properties of AI-generated stories, bypassing the need for an author.</p>
      
      <dt>Paratext (Genette)</dt>
      <dd>The material that surrounds a main text and shapes its interpretation, such as titles, prefaces, disclaimers, and even the user interface.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> For AI, the prompt, system messages, and safety warnings are crucial paratexts that must be included in any rigorous interpretation.</p>

      <dt>Psychological Rail (Schleiermacher)</dt>
      <dd>Reconstructing an author’s singular creative act. Inapplicable to AI in its original form, this interpretive goal is now often replaced by reception and form diagnostics.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Understanding its historical role helps clarify why author-agnostic methods like narratology are so crucial for AI.</p>

      <dt>Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff)</dt>
      <dd>An economic logic that treats human experience as free raw material for data extraction, analysis, and the creation of prediction products.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Provides the key framework for understanding the risks of "being read by an AI," where our interactions become data for a predictive system.</p>

      <dt>World of the Text (Ricoeur)</dt>
      <dd>The possible world or mode of being that a text projects in front of itself, which the reader can inhabit through interpretation.</dd>
      <p class="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Offers an ethical criterion for judging an AI text: does it open up a livable, coherent, and valuable world?</p>

      <dt>Wolfgang Iser (1926–2007)</dt>
      <dd>His concepts of the "implied reader" and "gaps" are central to analyzing user interaction with AI.</dd>

      <dt>Hans Robert Jauss (1921–1997)</dt>

      <dt>Paul Ricoeur (1913–2005)</dt>
      <dd>His theories of distanciation and the "world of the text" provide a positive ethical program for reading AI.</dd>
