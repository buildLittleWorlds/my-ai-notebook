            <h2>51 So about that shopping cart</h2>
            <p>I'm really not happy with my analysis of the shopping cart moment in <a href="post49.html">post 49</a>.</p>
            <p>I said it was something like this guy's unwillingness to grow up or his rejection of responsibility. And I do think the song obviously doesn't just want us to let this guy off the hook when it comes to his daughter. The mom is definitely there in the doorway not buying even a little bit into her daughter's excitement to see her dad coming to pick her up. So that's there.</p>
            <p>But it's not there in the shopping cart scene. The shopping cart is a moment of pleasure at work. It's something like a minimum-wage guy trying to steal a little time for himself while on the clock. So how does that fit in?</p>
            <p>It's related to what I think is the biggest question about the song. Who is the "you" the song keeps talking to? Who is supposed to "let me go" and who is this "you" the guy refuses to belong to when he says, "I don't want to be your hero?"</p>
            <p>The most painful and damning answer to that question is the daughter. But that can't be the conscious answer. That has to be some "real" answer the guy is refusing to acknowledge. That's the psychological argument I was trying to make in post 49.</p>
            <p>But that's not the whole song. Is the "you" America? Is it the flag that shows up at different places? Is it war? (Any talk about heroes has to include hidden references to war, and what's a rodeo but a stand-in for war?) So he's not willing to be that kind of hero anymore? There's some of that, I think, but that's not it either.</p>
            <p>There are temptations to say something like "traditional masculinity" or "cultural American manhood" or something like that. But I don't think there's evidence in the song of rejecting that.</p>
            <p>I don't have an answer right now. I'm going to keep working at it. I know it's connected to our Romantic intellectual heritage though. The hero for the Romantics was such a big deal. It's why they fell so hard for Napolean.</p>
