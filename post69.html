            <h2>69 The Expert's Anxiety</h2>
            <p>The most insidious argument against AI isn't the outright ban; it's the expert's hedge. It's the voice of the teacher, the manager, the self-proclaimed critical thinker who says, "I can handle this tool responsibly, but I'm worried about the masses. The students. The public. <em>They</em> will be harmed by it."</p>
            <p>This stance frames itself as care, but it's just the oldest form of gatekeeping, a transparent play to protect one's own authority. It's the same move the disciples made when they tried to shut down the unauthorized exorcist in the <a href="post68.html">last post</a>. The hypocrisy is so perfect it deserves a modern rewrite.</p>
            <blockquote>
                Then John, a tenured professor, came to him and said, “Teacher, we’ve been using this new generative tool in our research. We know how to handle it. We can spot the bias, correct the hallucinations, and use it to enhance our productivity.”
                <br><br>
                “But we see our students using it. They’re taking its output at face value. They’re losing their critical faculties. The amateurs are getting their hands on it, and they’re making a mess. They don’t have our training.”
                <br><br>
                “So we told them to stop,” John said. “We banned it in our syllabi. We called it academic dishonesty. We did this because they are not experts. Because they are not us.”
                <br><br>
                But the Teacher replied, “Do not stop them. You cannot. To forbid the tool is to admit you have nothing left to teach. For no one who uses it to create something can in the next moment be wholly ignorant. The work is not to protect them from the tool but to make your own work more valuable than the tool's. For whoever is not against the project of making and thinking is for it.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>Let's be clear about what's happening here. When the disciples saw the exorcist, they didn't see a miracle; they saw a threat to their exclusive franchise. Their concern wasn't for the man being healed; it was for their own status as the officially sanctioned miracle-workers. Their appeal to Jesus was a demand to enforce their monopoly.</p>
            <p>The modern expert does the exact same thing. The fear isn't really that students will become lazy or misinformed. The deeper, unstated anxiety is that the tools of knowledge production are being spread around without a system for carefully monitoring things. The real fear is that the expert's role as the exclusive gatekeeper of information and analysis might become obsolete. The "concern for the students" is a convenient and noble-sounding mask for a raw defense of professional territory.</p>
            <p>This isn't paternalism; it's a profound hypocrisy. It's claiming the right to use a powerful tool for yourself while denying it to the very people you are supposed to be empowering. It is an abdication of the teacher's primary duty: to prepare students for the world they will actually live in, not the world we wish we still controlled. Banning AI in the classroom is a retreat from the real, difficult work of education. It's easier to forbid the future than to figure out how to teach in it.</p>
            <p>The challenge from Jesus and Augustine is to stop obsessing over the credentials of the user and start looking at the quality of the work. Our job is not to protect our students from tools. It is to make ourselves, as teachers, more relevant and more necessary than the tools they can use without us.</p>
