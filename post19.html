            <h2>19 Propaganda and bias</h2>
            <p>The other big critique of AI is its bias. The fear is that AI will be unfair, that it will marginalize certain groups and reinforce stereotypes. But for Ellul, the exact opposite is the danger. Bias is a sign of weak propaganda.</p>
            <p>He argues that propaganda can't be satisfied with only reaching some people. It has to have everyone.</p>
            
            <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
                <p>Propaganda cannot be satisfied with partial successes... It must produce quasi-unanimity, and the opposing faction must become negligible, or in any case cease to be vocal.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>From this point of view, a biased system is a failed system. Bias creates an "opposing faction" by its very nature. It leaves people out. It creates friction and resistance. It is inefficient.</p>
            <p>The drive to create a "fair" and "unbiased" AI is therefore the drive to create a perfect propaganda. An AI that can speak to everyone, that includes everyone, that offends no one, is a system that can finally achieve the "quasi-unanimity" Ellul describes. It's a propaganda that no longer has an outside.</p>
