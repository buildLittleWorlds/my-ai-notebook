    <h1>Active vs. Reactive Reading: A Deleuzian Diagnostic for AI</h1>
    <p>If we follow Deleuze and reject the Romantic search for an author's soul, how do we evaluate texts? Deleuze, via Nietzsche, provides a new set of criteria. We no longer ask if a text is "sincere" or "authentic." We ask: is it **active** or **reactive**?</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reactive forces</strong> are forces of adaptation, limitation, and conformity. A reactive thought, value, or text is one that responds to, and is defined by, something external to it. It is born of what Nietzsche called *ressentiment*.</li>
      <li><strong>Active forces</strong> are forces of creation, difference, and affirmation. An active thought goes to the limit of what it can do, creating its own values from a position of power.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This distinction gives us a powerful diagnostic tool, not for judging AI itself, but for analyzing our own engagement with it.</p>

      <h2>The Reader as Active or Reactive</h2>
      <p>Deleuze’s critique of "goodwill" is a critique of reactive reading. The reactive reader is passive, relying on convention and habit to understand a text. They want the text to conform to their expectations. The active reader, faced with a text that resists easy interpretation, is forced to create new concepts to make sense of it.</p>
      <p>Joe Hughes argues that Deleuze's difficult prose is designed to "engineer the basic failure of our reading habits." This failure is what allows an active reading to begin. This framework completely reframes our interaction with AI.</p>

      <h2>AI Prompting as an Active or Reactive Art</h2>
      <p>Most engagement with LLMs is fundamentally reactive. As noted in <a href="post37.html">Post 37</a>, a vague prompt produces a "blurry jpeg of the web"—a statistically average, and therefore highly conventional, response. This is a **reactive dialogue**: a reactive user asks a reactive question and gets a reactive answer.</p>
      <p>An **active engagement** with AI, however, would aim to engineer a failure in the machine's reactive habits. The goal of a good prompt is to force the LLM out of its conventional pathways and into a more novel, less probable region of its latent space.</p>
      
      <h3>A Deleuzian Diagnostic for Prompts:</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Reactive Prompting:</strong> Asks the AI to summarize, explain, or generate something based on established norms ("Write a professional email," "Explain photosynthesis"). It seeks to reproduce existing knowledge. It is an act of *ressentiment* against the blank page.</li>
          <li><strong>Active Prompting:</strong> Forces the AI to synthesize disparate concepts, to create connections where none existed. ("Write a legal brief in the poetic style of a 17th-century mystic," "Design a marketing plan based on the migratory patterns of birds.") It is an act of affirmation, using the machine to create a new possibility.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This shifts the entire ethical and aesthetic burden. The question is not whether the AI has a soul. The question is whether we are using it as an active tool for creation or a reactive machine for conformity.</p>
