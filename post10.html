            <h2>10 Evil as Systemic Harm (after Philosophy Tube)</h2>

<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>This page distills a general account of evil implicit in Philosophy Tube’s “AI is an Ethical Nightmare,” then applies it to AI.</p>

<h3>General Definition</h3>
<p><strong>Evil = systemic harm sustained by opaque power.</strong> Evil names arrangements that concentrate power, <em>hide</em> how decisions are made, project false meanings onto bodies, externalize environmental costs, and deskill or atomize labor—thereby denying people material safety, agency, and recourse.</p>

<h3>Constituent Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opacity:</strong> black‑box systems that deny meaningful explanation and remedy.</li>
<li><strong>Projection:</strong> technologies that impose categories onto people (e.g., gender/race) and treat those labels as truths.</li>
<li><strong>Extraction:</strong> flattening living labor into “data,” and treating that as ownerless raw material.</li>
<li><strong>Externalities:</strong> shifting real ecological and social costs onto the public while privatizing benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Ideology:</strong> hype and marketing that pre‑empt democratic debate and accountability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How AI Is Evil (on this view)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fair‑washing &amp; black boxes:</strong> inscrutable models + surrogate “explanations” launder biased outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Digital epidermalization:</strong> face/gender recognition that <em>assigns</em> meaning to your body and can enable humiliation and harm.</li>
<li><strong>Data flattening:</strong> scraping human work and images without consent; remixing them as “content.”</li>
<li><strong>Sub‑employment:</strong> globally distributed, surveilled microwork that pays little and offers no power or recourse.</li>
<li><strong>Dirty material base:</strong> mining, energy use, and supply chains packaged as “clean.”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moral Center</h3>
<p>Goodness here is democratic control over the material conditions of life: worker power, transparent and contestable decisions, consent‑respecting data practices, and ecological limits.</p>
