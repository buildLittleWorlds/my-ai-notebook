            <h2>26 The pastor as romantic author</h2>
            <p>The idea of a pastor using AI to write a sermon prompts an almost universal feeling of protest. Probably even for people who aren't religious, it feels like a profound betrayal. But a betrayal of what, exactly? A recent interview with Dr. Scott Stiegemeyer on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpLEWub6Fq8">"Issues, Etc.,"</a> a radio show and podcast from the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod (LCMS), gives us the vocabulary for this feeling. In doing so, it reveals how deeply our modern idea of the pastor is a Romantic one. The outrage isn't just about doctrinal error; it's a defense of the pastor as a singular, authentic author.</p>
            
            <p>Stiegemeyer’s core objection is that an AI-generated sermon is an "empty form." He repeats the phrase like a mantra: in creating it, there is "<em>no one there</em>." This is the language of presence versus simulation. The sermon, in this view, is not merely a technical report on a biblical text; it is a sincere offering from the pastor's own soul. For him to use AI is to engage in a kind of <a href="post9.html">"inauthenticity"</a>, to speak words he does not inhabit. It is a "profaned communion."</p>

            <p>This leads to the second, and perhaps most Romantic, pillar of his argument: the moral necessity of the struggle. He says it plainly: "We learn from the struggle." He would rather receive a student's "inferior" but authentic work than a machine's polished product. The value is located in the process, the long hours of study, prayer, and wrestling with the text. This effort is what forms the pastor's character and gives the sermon its integrity. To bypass this struggle with AI is a failure of vocation, a refusal of what Romantics saw as the "tragic seriousness" of a life lived in truth.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, Stiegemeyer frames this as a theological rejection of Gnosticism, the heresy that separates spirit from body. Using AI for a sermon, he argues, is an attempt to "separate word from flesh." This is a theological defense of a purely Romantic ideal. The universal Word, to be effective, must be made particular in the flesh of the pastor: his voice, his mind, his lived experience. This is the very same problem I explored in Whitman's <a href="post25.html">"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry."</a> We need to believe there is an authentic, embodied person on the other end of the transmission. A sermon generated by a disembodied intelligence, no matter how eloquent, feels like a violation because "there's no one there" to pour their meaning into us.</p>

            <p>It's useful to remember that this wasn't always the case. For centuries, it was common for pastors to use a <em>postil</em> (a book of pre-written sermons) to aid their preaching. The pastor's role was that of a faithful herald, not a unique creative artist. The modern expectation is different. We expect the wince of the writer's struggle to be felt by the reader, or in this case, the listener. We expect our pastors to be Romantic authors. Stiegemeyer’s thoughtful critique is the perfect articulation of this modern, and deeply romanticized, conception of the pastoral office.</p>
