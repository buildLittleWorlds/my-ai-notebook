            <h2>16 Propaganda and my feelings</h2>
            <p>Continuing with Jacques Ellul's book. How does propaganda work with our need to feel like authentic individuals? How about this quote?</p>
            
            <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
                <p>It appeals to me. It appeals to my common sense, my desires, and provokes my wrath and my indignation. It evokes my feelings of justice and my desire for freedom. It gives me violent feelings, which lift me out of the daily grind.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This gets to the heart of it. Propaganda doesn't feel like a command from outside. It feels like an emotion from inside. It makes me feel that my anger is righteous, that my desires are just. It boosts my ego.</p>
            <p>The most successful propaganda makes me feel more like myself. And the more I feel like myself, the more I'm in its grip.</p>
