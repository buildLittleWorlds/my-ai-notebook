            <h2>11 Evil as Frustrated Ends (after New Polity)</h2>

<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>This page abstracts the New Polity argument into a general account of evil and then considers AI in that light.</p>

<h3>General Definition</h3>
<p><strong>Evil = privation of an act’s natural end.</strong> Human acts have built‑in purposes (<em>teloi</em>). Evil names designs and uses that <em>elicit</em> those acts while <em>frustrating</em> their ends—forming vice. Chief example: conversation, whose end is <em>communion with another person</em>.</p>

<h3>Constituent Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simulacrum:</strong> performing the form of an act (e.g., dialogue) without its substance (a someone who answers).</li>
<li><strong>Asymmetry:</strong> habituating one‑sided exposure without reciprocal responsibility or vulnerability.</li>
<li><strong>Misalignment:</strong> treating persons as means or as data; attenuating truth‑telling and promise‑keeping.</li>
<li><strong>Deformation:</strong> repeated frustrated acts reshape character—toward cynicism, dependency, and untruth.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How AI Is Evil (on this view)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chat simulation:</strong> chatbots elicit our conversational vulnerability while withholding real personhood—frustrating communion.</li>
<li><strong>Analogy to lying:</strong> dialogue’s form without interior truthfulness degrades the virtue of speech.</li>
<li><strong>One‑way intimacy:</strong> users reveal themselves; the system cannot do the same, yet retains their disclosures as “data.”</li>
<li><strong>Habit formation:</strong> such use trains dispositions (toward flattery, passivity, and instrumental reason) at odds with honesty and love.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moral Center</h3>
<p>Goodness is truthful conversation ordered to real communion—mutual self‑gift before a someone who can answer and be responsible.</p>
