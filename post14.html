            <h2>14 Back to the romantic</h2>
            <p>All that work I just did about evil makes me think I can just go back to the romantics and think about what they thought. If I do that, I'll catch in the same net a lot of what everyone feels about AI. I do think there's a lot of gut-feeling stuff going on here.</p>
            <p>I don't buy it though. So much of the fight against AI is about sincerity and authenticity and some notion of a human spark.</p>
            <p>Why don't I buy that? Because we're not living in the 1800's anymore.</p>
            <p>Pretty crazy, though. All it took to get philosophy tube to hold hands with the catholics was to serve up a solid shared villain: AI chatbots.</p>
