        <h2>71 Schleiermacher's Divided Self: A Romantic Who Knew We Weren't Whole</h2>

        <p>For a while now, this blog has been tracking what I call the <a href="post21.html">"Romantic trace"</a> in our debates about AI. I've argued that our anxieties about authenticity and soulless machines are a replay of a worldview we inherited from the 1800s. In my series <a href="post53.html">"Reconsidering the Romantics,"</a> I tried to build a more rigorous version of this worldview to avoid attacking a strawman. Now it's time to go back to one of the sources: Friedrich Schleiermacher, a foundational figure of German Romanticism.</p>

        <p>His 1800 book, <a href="https://dn720002.ca.archive.org/0/items/schleiermacherss00schl/schleiermacherss00schl.pdf"><em>Soliloquies</em></a>, is a classic Romantic text, his exploration of the "inner life." But when you read it closely, the "self" he describes isn't the simple, unified, authentic soul we might expect. Schleiermacher's subject is far stranger, more complex, and more useful for our current moment. It is a self that is relational, functionally divided, and perpetually under construction.</p>

        <h3>1. The Self is Not an Atom; It's a Relationship</h3>
        <p>The caricature of the Romantic individual is a solitary genius, an isolated soul generating meaning from within. Schleiermacher's model is the exact opposite. For him, individuality isn't something you <em>have</em> in isolation; it's something you <em>achieve</em> through connection and contrast. A self, to be a self, requires an Other.</p>

        <p>He writes that a person can only maintain consciousness of their unique selfhood if they constantly "survey the whole of humanity, opposing his own expression of it to every other possible one." He states it even more plainly:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Contrast is indispensable to set individuality in relief.</strong></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This is a really modern, almost structuralist idea. Like Saussure's theory that the meaning of a word comes from its difference from all other words, Schleiermacher's self is defined not by its essence, but by its position within a system of relations. He argues that without "love" and "sensitiveness" (the faculties for engaging with others) the project of self-formation would be impossible, "shattering because of the frightful disproportion between giving and receiving." The self isn't a pre-existing thing; it's an effect that emerges from a network of differences.</p>

        <h3>2. The Inner Blossom and the Outer Fruit: A Functional Division</h3>
        <p>The Romantic ideal (or caricature) I've been critiquing is that of total sincerity, a perfect alignment between a person's inner feeling and their outer action. Schleiermacher presents a more pragmatic, functionally divided model. In his final soliloquy, he argues that we should "marry" the eternal principles of Youth and Age within ourselves.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Inner Self (Youth):</strong> This part should be eternally "young, tender, plastic, impressionable, forever growing and blooming." It is the site of feeling, imagination, and spontaneous development. It operates without rules, driven by "inner impulse with a gracious and perfect joy."</li>
            <li><strong>The Outer Self (Age):</strong> This is the self that interacts with the world. It should be governed by "sober wisdom, cool self-possession, a rich experience." It produces "sound fruit, ripened and well-seasoned in the cool deliberation of mature wisdom."</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This isn't a hypocrisy. It's a strategic division of labor. The inner world is a space of absolute freedom and becoming, while the outer world is a space of strategic, careful action. This model offers a fascinating way to think about AI. One could argue that AI is a tool for the "outer self" (an instrument for producing "fruit" for the world (drafting emails, organizing data, generating code)) while leaving the "inner" space of impression and feeling untouched. The fear of AI corrupting the authentic soul rests on the assumption that the soul must be a unified, transparent whole. Schleiermacher's model suggests the self has always been a more complex and functionally divided machine.</p>

        <h3>3. The Unfinished Self</h3>
        <p>Finally, Schleiermacherâ€™s self is not a stable entity to be "expressed." It is a project that is never finished. The <em>Soliloquies</em> are not a declaration of who he is, but an ongoing investigation. He admits,</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"the picture of my individuality does not yet present itself to me complete in all its features, and is not yet certified by an unbroken continuity of clear self-consciousness."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is the Romantic idea of <em>Bildung</em> (formation or self-cultivation) in its purest form. The self is a text that is constantly being written and rewritten. This resonates with the post-structuralist ideas I've explored from thinkers like <a href="ai-kit-butler-performativity.html">Judith Butler</a>. If the self is not a pre-existing "doer behind the deed" but is performatively constituted, then Schleiermacher's "crisis-autobiography" is a pretty strong example of performance in action. He is creating his "self" in the act of trying to interpret it.</p>

        <h3>What Schleiermacher Gives Us</h3>
        <p>Going back to this foundational Romantic text doesn't reinforce the sentimental caricature. It torques it a bit. Puts pressure on it. Schleiermacher gives us a model of the human subject that's relational, functionally divided, and perpetually in process. This is a self that's better equipped to survive in the world I've been trying to map out here.</p>
