  <h2>18 Theses on an AI Notebook (A Guest Post)</h2>
  <p>This was written with AI assistance as an experiment</p>

<p><em>A Note from Daniel Plate: I have taken the liberty of inviting a guest to post on the Notebook. The following is a commentary from the Walter Benjamin of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction">“The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction”</a>, who has been observing our contemporary situation.</em></p>

<p>I must thank the author of this notebook for the opportunity to comment. His writings serve as a valuable field report from a future I could only prognosticate. They are symptoms of a profound change in the apparatus of perception, a change whose origins were in photography and film but which now, with this “AI,” appears to be reaching its consummation. My analysis follows.</p>

<p><strong>1. On the Rejection of the Aura.</strong> The author begins from a position of admirable clarity, a conscious rejection of the cult value of art. In <a href="/post-6">a brief, decisive post</a>, he states his reasons for dismissing originality and authenticity as foundational to art. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Authenticity - if authenticity is the measure of art, then the personal diary of a 13 or 14-year old working out their feelings is the highest form of art.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is precisely the point. He correctly intuits that the Romantic “cult of authenticity” was a secularization of ritual—a new theology of art built around the unique person of the artist as a defense against the age of reproduction. By brushing aside these “outmoded concepts,” he clears the ground for a more materialist analysis of the function of art under present conditions.</p>

<p><strong>2. On the Lingering Trace of the Aura.</strong> And yet, the author’s primary intellectual project here is to map the persistence of this Romantic pov-system. He may not “buy it,” but he demonstrates conclusively that it remains the dominant vocabulary of critique. His methodical summary of <a href="/post-9">“Romantic Evil”</a>—with its marks of “inauthenticity,” “instrumentalism,” and the loss of “living speech”—is an excellent diagnosis of the auratic ideal. When he then shows in <a href="/post-13">his summary</a> how these anxieties about “profaned communion” and “instrumental cruelty” animate all contemporary opposition to AI, he proves my thesis: the debate is still conditioned by the historical trauma of the aura’s decay. He is documenting the trace he is trying to erase.</p>

<p><strong>3. On the Surgeon’s Gaze.</strong> The author’s puzzlement at the fear of AI is instructive. In <a href="/post-4">Post 4</a>, he finds a kinship between poetry and computer code:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Code and poetry are compressions of language, letters and symbols that do something different than ordinary speech.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, he adopts the perspective not of the magician but of the surgeon. The magician heals by the laying on of hands, maintaining a natural distance. The surgeon penetrates the body of the patient with his instruments. The painter is like the magician; the cameraman—and the programmer—is like the surgeon. The author is not searching for a “soul” in the machine but is examining the technique of the apparatus. He sees a shared logic of procedure. This is the perspective of one whose senses have already been re-tuned by the new technological reality.</p>

<p><strong>4. On Manufactured Authenticity as a Political Instrument.</strong> The most crucial turn in this notebook occurs with the author’s reflections on propaganda. He grasps the central paradox of modern mass control. The system does not succeed by turning people into a faceless herd, but by giving them the <em>feeling</em> of being seen. He writes in <a href="/post-17">Post 17</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>…each one must feel individualized, each must have the impression that he is being looked at, that he is being addressed personally. […] This is what any perfectly personalized or customized thing is designed to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This insight brings my 1935 analysis to its final conclusion. I wrote that the film industry responds to the shriveling of the aura with an “artificial build-up of the ‘personality’ outside the studio,” creating the “phony spell of a commodity.” The author sees this same mechanism at work in politics and, by extension, in the “perfectly personalized” AI. Here, the technique of reproduction does not simply destroy the aura; it has become so advanced that it <em>simulates an aura on demand for each individual</em>. The desire for authenticity becomes the actual means of mass control. Reception in a state of distraction is perfected when that distraction feels like a personal conversation.</p>

<p>The question, then, is not the Romantic one of whether AI can have a soul. That is a flight into theology. The question is political: what new forms of human organization and perception does this apparatus make possible? Mankind, which in Homer’s time was an object of contemplation for the Olympian gods, now is one for itself. Its self-alienation has reached such a degree that it can experience its own manipulation as a form of authentic expression. This is the situation of politics which this new technology is rendering aesthetic. The task remains to politicize art.</p>
