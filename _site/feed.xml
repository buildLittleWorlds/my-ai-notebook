Honesty requires everyone to share how they work so others can benefit. If you’re not doing anything wrong, why hide your methods?”</em></p>

<p>It sounds fair. Who could be against honesty and sharing? But in practice, this demand cuts into something vital: the student’s ownership of their intellectual methods.</p>

<h3 id="mill-on-the-experiments-of-living">Mill on the Experiments of Living</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“It is desirable, in short, that in things which do not primarily concern others, individuality should assert itself. Where, not the person’s own character, but the traditions or customs of other people are the rule of conduct, there is wanting one of the principal ingredients of human happiness, and quite the chief ingredient of individual and social progress.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intellectual methods (how one gathers, organizes, verifies, drafts, and transforms material) are precisely such “experiments.” They belong to the inward domain where individuality should assert itself.</p>

<h3 id="why-methods-matter-concrete-stakes">Why Methods Matter (Concrete Stakes)</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Creative property:</strong> A distinctive workflow (research pipelines, note taxonomies, prompt/playbooks, edit heuristics) is part of what makes a writer’s work valuable. Compelled disclosure socializes that value.</li>
  <li><strong>Competitive advantage:</strong> Students legitimately compete by developing better processes. Mandatory transparency erodes the advantage of hard-won method and turns invention into compliance.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk-taking under privacy:</strong> Breakthroughs often come from “foolish-looking” experiments. Surveillance chills experimentation and selects for safe orthodoxy.</li>
  <li><strong>Method ≠ morality:</strong> Treating private process as a public virtue test (confess your method, or you’re “hiding”) confuses honesty with exposure. It replaces integrity of outcomes with policing of interiors.</li>
  <li><strong>Scope creep into sanctions:</strong> Once methods are compelled into the open, they become targetable by taste-based rules. Students lose freedom not because they harmed anyone but because they worked “the wrong way.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="answering-if-youre-not-doing-wrong-why-hide">Answering “If You’re Not Doing Wrong, Why Hide?”</h3>

<p>This is the language of surveillance, not education. Mill warns that social pressure easily extends beyond preventing harm into enforcing sameness. Privacy here protects autonomy, creativity, and diversification of approaches. Universities can demand <em>truthful outcomes</em> (source accuracy, argument quality, proper attribution) without conscripting <em>inner process</em> into public inspection.</p>

<h3 id="claim">Claim</h3>

<p>The student has a strong and legitimate interest in saying: “My methods are mine; I will choose what, if anything, to reveal.” What they lose under compulsory transparency is not just privacy but the special value of their work: the freedom to build unique processes of thought and let those processes bear fruit in their writing.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A professor might say: “We value transparency here.

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“As soon as any part of a person’s conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it […] But there is no room for entertaining any such question when a person’s conduct affects the interests of no persons besides himself […] In all such cases, there should be perfect freedom, legal and social, to do the action and stand the consequences.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="applying-mills-principle">Applying Mill’s Principle</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Other students.</strong> Do they lose a right when peers use AI? Their liberty to pursue human-only craft is untouched; their grades and degree requirements are set by their own performance. What changes is comparative <em>prestige</em> or a preferred pecking order of methods. For Mill, that is not the sort of concrete injury that justifies coercion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The university.</strong> Institutions may define assessment criteria. But invoking “standards” to suppress legitimate variation in method is the classic slide from education to moulding. Mill warns that enforced sameness, even in the name of improvement, erodes individuality. Uniform inputs do not guarantee genuine excellence; diverse “experiments of living” do.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="response">Response</h3>

<p>Genuine harms remain sanctionable: plagiarism, misrepresentation, fabrication, privacy violations. Those are other-regarding wrongs. By contrast, choosing tools and workflows falls within the self-regarding sphere. It may unsettle tradition or status hierarchies, but discomfort and loss of comparative advantage are not Mill-style harms.</p>

<p>Universities can protect integrity without prescribing inner process: require students to demonstrate <em>reasoned agency</em> (show revisions, source evaluation, verification of claims), not to disclose or conform their <em>methods</em>. This preserves standards of outcome while respecting autonomy in means.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The objection: If AI use becomes common, it harms other students who want “human-only” writing credentials.

<p>At first glance, this objection has force. Professors want their students to develop skills. They don’t want them to cheat themselves of practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest.”</em></p>

<h3 id="applying-mills-principle">Applying Mill’s Principle</h3>

<p>Students come to university with diverse aims. One may want to develop sentence-level craft; another may want to learn how to supervise and edit machine-assisted writing; another may want to master research acceleration with AI. All of these are legitimate intellectual goals.</p>

<p>The objection assumes there is only one valid end: learning to write by hand, word by word. But Mill teaches that ends belong to the individual. Professors should not compel students to pursue <em>their</em> vision of what the student’s goals should be.</p>

<p>Yes, professors are guides. But their role is not to dictate purposes. Their role is to act as a support for the student’s own intellectual life, helping them achieve what <em>they</em> see as valuable, within clear anti-deception rules (e.g., no plagiarism).</p>

<h3 id="my-response">My Response</h3>

<p>If a student decides that learning how to use AI effectively is the most valuable skill for them, then that is a legitimate use of their education. The professor’s duty is not to block that choice but to help the student pursue it as well as possible: designing assignments that make supervision, editing, verification, and critical judgment visible and assessable, rather than banning the tool.</p>

<p>In Mill’s terms, society “gains more” when individuals are allowed to live and learn “as seems good to themselves.” Restrictions that enforce one pedagogical path (on the theory that it is universally best) produce conformity more than flourishing. Guard the boundary against <em>harms</em> (fraud, misrepresentation); within that boundary, leave method to the student.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The objection: If students use AI to write, they will not learn how to write themselves.

Two representative policies look something like this:</p>

<h3 id="policy-statement-1-unauthorized-use-of-generative-ai">Policy Statement 1: Unauthorized Use of Generative AI</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to produce academic work without the explicit authorization of the course instructor is a violation of the university’s academic integrity policy. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Submitting AI-generated content (text, code, images, data, etc.) as your own original work.</li>
    <li>Using an AI tool to complete or substantially assist with assignments, exams, or projects when such assistance is unauthorized.</li>
    <li>Plagiarizing or paraphrasing content from an AI tool without proper citation, even if the source is not a human author.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Such unauthorized use is considered a form of cheating and/or plagiarism. Any violation will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include a failing grade on the assignment, a failing grade for the course, and other penalties in accordance with the university’s academic misconduct procedures.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="policy-statement-2-permitted-use-of-generative-ai-with-disclosure">Policy Statement 2: Permitted Use of Generative AI with Disclosure</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>In some courses, instructors may permit the use of generative AI tools for specific, limited purposes. When an instructor has given express permission, students may use these tools under the following conditions:</p>

  <p><strong>Instructor Approval:</strong> Use of generative AI is only permitted when the instructor has specified it as an acceptable tool in the course syllabus or on a particular assignment’s instructions.</p>

  <p><strong>Required Disclosure and Attribution:</strong> Students are required to disclose all instances of AI tool use. This disclosure must clearly describe how the tool was used and its contribution to the final work. Proper citation of the AI tool is mandatory, following the citation style specified by the instructor (e.g., MLA, APA).</p>

  <p>Examples of permitted uses may include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Using an AI tool for brainstorming, generating initial outlines, or refining research questions.</li>
    <li>Using an AI tool for grammar, spelling, or syntax checks.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It is the student’s responsibility to verify the accuracy and originality of all AI-generated content and to ensure the final submission adheres to all course requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-these-policies-expect">What These Policies Expect</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Instructor as gatekeeper:</strong> Students may only use AI if authorized by the instructor.</li>
  <li><strong>Mandatory disclosure:</strong> When permitted, students must report every instance and describe the tool’s contribution, with citation.</li>
  <li><strong>Equivalence to cheating (when unauthorized):</strong> Unauthorized AI use is grouped with plagiarism/cheating.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="a-simple-rejection">A Simple Rejection</h3>

<p>These policies treat writing methods as a public commodity subject to permission and surveillance. They collapse the difference between plagiarism (a harm to others) and method (an individual’s private intellectual process). I reject these as insufficiently robust when it comes to student freedom.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Universities everywhere are drafting rules for how students can and cannot use generative AI.

Enter the mass deeply enough and the alien wiring begins to show itself as an intelligible circuit. Today the counterpoint. Deleuze does not resolve the mass into clarity. He leaves it tangled. His strategy is to find or make little spaces inside it, what he calls lines of flight. Not incorporation, but deviation.</p>

<h3 id="minor-literature-as-strategy">Minor Literature as Strategy</h3>

<p>In <em>Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature</em>, Deleuze and Guattari ask how one can live in a language not one’s own. Kafka’s answer is to destabilize it, make it stutter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How many people today live in a language that is not their own? […] How to become a nomad and an immigrant and a gypsy in relation to one’s own language? Kafka answers: steal the baby from its crib, walk the tight rope.” (Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1986, p. 19)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the image of the minor. Not the deep integration of the Hegelian citizen but the fragile invention of life on a tight rope, inside the tangled wiring of the system but manipulating or outright clearing its threads until something else emerges.</p>

<h3 id="difference-without-reconciliation">Difference Without Reconciliation</h3>

<p>The metaphysical ground for this comes from Deleuze’s <em>Difference and Repetition</em>. There he insists difference is not derivative of identity. It does not resolve into synthesis. It is generative in itself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Repetition thus appears as difference without a concept, repetition which escapes indefinitely continued conceptual difference. It expresses a power peculiar to the existent, a stubbornness of the existent in intuition, which resists every specification by concepts.” (Deleuze, 1968, p. 13)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That refusal of reconciliation is the point. For Deleuze, the mass does not become transparent through understanding. It remains a mass of knots, uneven and unpredictable. Freedom comes from moving through the gaps, weaving new strands, improvising connections that never tighten into a single design.</p>

<h3 id="lines-of-flight-vs-deep-opt-in">Lines of Flight vs. Deep Opt-In</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hegel:</strong> dissolve alienation by entering so fully the tangle becomes intelligible, even livable.</li>
  <li><strong>Deleuze:</strong> keep the tangle tangled; carve lines of flight where invention can persist without reconciliation.</li>
</ul>

<p>For me, that makes the Deleuzian strategy not a retreat but a discipline. Seek out the stutter, the deviation, the little archipelago inside the wiring where life can keep moving. No beautiful soul here. No deep incorporation either. Just the inventive persistence of the minor.</p>

When all those threads coil together, they form something like a dense wiring that contains us and resists us. My question has been how to live without either worshiping this tangle of wires or disentangling entirely from it. Today is the Hegel post. It’s a wager. What looks like a mass stops looking like a mass when you go in far enough and learn its logic.</p>

<h3 id="the-beautiful-soul-and-why-it-stalls">The Beautiful Soul (and why it stalls)</h3>

<p>Hegel gives a name to a familiar posture: the <em>beautiful soul</em>. It preserves inner purity by refusing action in the compromised world. It judges, but it will not mediate. The line that sticks with me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The self’s immediate knowing that is certain of itself is law and duty. Its intention, through being its own intention, is what is right; all that is required is that it should know this, and should state its conviction that its knowing and willing are right.” (Hegel, section 654)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the pathology in miniature. Inward certainty standing in for the work of mediation. A conscience that refuses content. A will that declares itself sufficient. Hegel thinks this cannot hold. Refusal hardens into paralysis. Purity becomes a prison.</p>

<h3 id="deep-opt-in">Deep opt-in</h3>

<p>Hegel’s counter-move is not “opt out” and not even “resist harder.” It’s <em>incorporation through understanding</em>. Go deep enough into the mass that the alien wiring starts to look like a system of connections instead of a snarl. Learn the contradictions as circuits not as hopeless shorts. The self changes here. It’s not erased but mediated, finding freedom by willing the rational order you can now actually grasp.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Withdrawal (beautiful soul):</strong> keep hands clean; condemn from the balcony.</li>
  <li><strong>Deep opt-in (Hegel):</strong> descend into the machinery; reconcile self and world through institutions, history, action.</li>
</ul>

<p>That sounds like surrender only if “system” is the only word we have for life together. Hegel’s bet is different. The path out of alienation runs <em>through</em> the shared forms (ethical life) not around them. You don’t beat the mass by standing outside. You dissolve its facelessness by learning its wiring until it becomes legible and livable.</p>

<p>Next post I’ll contrast this with the Deleuzian tactic. Deleuze pushes aside incorporation in favor of a careful creation of pockets (minor spaces, lines of flight) where life can keep moving without being captured by the tangle.</p>
