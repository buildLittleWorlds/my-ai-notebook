  <h2>68 The Unauthorized Exorcist and the Wicked Preacher</h2>
  <p>In the <a href="/post-67">last post</a>, I explored Augustine’s idea that truth can be transmitted through an “inauthentic” source, like a wicked preacher. His point is that the value of a message isn’t determined by the moral purity of the person who speaks it. This is a tough idea for us to accept. We have a deep instinct to be gatekeepers, to insist that good work can only come from an authorized, card-carrying member of our own group.</p>

<p>This instinct shows up in the Gospels. In the book of Mark, the disciple John comes to Jesus with a complaint. He’s found someone operating outside their official circle, doing good work without the proper credentials.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Teacher,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us.” (Mark 9:38)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the classic insider complaint. “He’s not one of us.” The disciples’ immediate reaction is to shut it down. They are acting as guardians of <a href="/romantic-kit-authenticity">authenticity</a>, believing that the power to do this work belongs exclusively to them. The source, in their view, is what legitimizes the action.</p>

<p>Jesus’s response is a complete rejection of their gatekeeping. He turns their logic on its head:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Do not stop him,” Jesus said. “For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, for whoever is not against us is for us.” (Mark 9:39-40)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus’s criteria are radically different. He isn’t concerned with the person’s credentials or whether he’s part of the “in-group.” He’s concerned with the outcome. Is a good thing happening? Is a demon being cast out? Does the work ultimately point toward him? If so, let it be. He judges the work by its fruits, not by the official status of the worker.</p>

<p>This is the same principle Augustine uses for his wicked preacher. Augustine argues that the truth of a sermon is guaranteed by the “seat” the preacher occupies, the system of doctrine he transmits. Jesus argues that the validity of the miracle is guaranteed by its result. Both arrive at the same conclusion: the work has an integrity of its own, separate from the <a href="/romantic-kit-authenticity">authenticity</a> of the worker. Its meaning gains a kind of <a href="/ai-kit-distanciation">semantic autonomy</a>.</p>

<p>This gives us another lens for looking at AI. Our first, instinctual reaction is often the same as the disciples’: “Stop it. It’s not one of us.” We see a machine driving out the “demons” of the blank page or creative block, and because it’s not a human, we want to shut it down. But the challenge from both Jesus and Augustine is to shift our criteria. Instead of asking if the source is human, we should be asking: What are the fruits of this work? Can a good outcome be achieved? Can we, as Augustine said, appropriate its “gold” for a better purpose? It’s a much harder and more interesting question than simply checking it for a human pulse.</p>
