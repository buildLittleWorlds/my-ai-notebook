  <h2>64 One Way I'm Really Different From Everyone</h2>
  <p>I could be wrong. Obviously I don’t know everyone, so I can’t know how many people are like me on this one thing. And I don’t literally mean “everyone.” I know one or two people who agree with me on this.</p>

<p>That said, when it comes to public conversations out there on Youtube and the popular press, and when it comes to official pronouncements like policy guidelines and things like that, I am a complete outlier on this.</p>

<p>I am completely against this idea that seems common-sense for everyone else. I hate the idea that we should draw a clear line between things created by AI and things created by humans. I consider this a deeply wrongheaded invasion of the rights of authorship. As I see it, a fundamental power of every author is the hiddenness of their methods. I should not have to reveal how I made the thing I made in just the same way a magician should not have to reveal how they made their magic.</p>

<p>Immediately someone will reply. But the whole idea of the magician is a disclosure upfront that it’s not real. We do require every magician to state at the outset, “Don’t worry. This isn’t real. It’s a trick.”</p>

<p>I’m against that too.</p>

<p>It’s hard to track down the actual quote but there’s anecdotal reporting that David Foster Wallace once said the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m not that smart. I’m smart when I sit and think and have enough time; I’m not smart on the spot. I’m not smart when I’m scared. I’m not smart in front of five people with their eyes on me. But alone in a room — I can be a genius.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s what I’m talking about. That’s what I mean by the magic of an author. I shouldn’t have to reveal any of my secrets about the muse I tap into when I go into that room and come back out with the written work. That’s my business.</p>
