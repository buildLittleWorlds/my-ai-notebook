  <h2>78 Reading as Communion, a New Interpretive Goal</h2>
  <p>The Romantic way of understanding and expressing reality did more than just redefine the author and their moral duties; it redefined the act of reading. If an artwork is the <a href="/post-75">organic unfolding</a> of a singular soul, then to truly understand it requires more than just analyzing its grammar and structure. It requires an act of communion.</p>

<p>This is the core of <a href="/romantic-kit-hermeneutics">Romantic Hermeneutics</a>, the interpretive method developed by thinkers like Schleiermacher. He argued that understanding is not our default state; misunderstanding is the norm. To overcome this, an interpreter must move beyond the “grammatical” side of a text (its public language and form) and engage with its “psychological” side. As I’ve touched on in <a href="/post-57">“The Search for the Divine Spark,”</a> this psychological rail is not about amateur psychoanalysis; it is a disciplined attempt to reconstruct the unique, creative vision that gave the work its shape.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of this method is a “divinatory leap,” a sympathetic, intuitive act of understanding where the reader imaginatively merges their consciousness with the reconstructed consciousness of the author. Successful interpretation becomes a form of psychological intimacy, a temporary fusion of two souls. As Walt Whitman perfectly enacted in <a href="/post-25">“Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,”</a> the reader is invited into a direct, personal encounter with the author’s living presence.</p>

<p>This redefinition of reading as communion is what makes engagement with an unethical artist so perilous. If the act of watching a film or reading a book is understood as an invitation to psychically inhabit its creator’s perspective, who would willingly choose to “merge” their consciousness with that of a known abuser or bigot? The experience becomes an act of intimacy with a contaminated source. The refusal to watch or listen is a refusal of this communion, a slamming of the door on the “divinatory leap” into a consciousness now known to be toxic.</p>

<p>This entire interpretive model (this technology for reading) was invented to access the newly sacred inner life of the author. It is an important tool, but its own logic dictates that when the source is perceived as corrupt, the only safe and moral act is to refuse the connection entirely.</p>
