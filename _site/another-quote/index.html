  <h2>35 Another Quote</h2>
  <p>Digging into the later parts of <em>Enoch</em>, in the section about how the cosmos works. It’s less about angels and more about the mechanics of the world: the sun and the moon and the winds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And at the ends of the earth I saw twelve portals open to all the quarters from which the winds go forth and blow over the earth… Through four of these come winds of blessing and prosperity and from those eight come hurtful winds: when they are sent, they bring destruction on all the earth…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea of permeability here is almost architectural. The world is presented as a structure with “portals.” It’s not a closed system. It’s open to an outside that sends things in. “Blessing and prosperity” and “destruction.” The human world is completely open to these forces that flow in through designed entry points.</p>
