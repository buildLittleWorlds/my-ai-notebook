<h2 id="provenance">Provenance</h2>

<p>Compiled from west-edge Densmok stool transcripts and lane interviews; cross-checked with
ditch-readers’ ledgers and three roadside sermons recovered from the north spur into Dens.</p>

<h2 id="extract">Extract</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two kinds of story you’ll hear about Dens.
In one: a regular town—dirty, small, out on the edge.
In the other: the wilderness itself is alive, thickening by the day, pushing up against houses
until streets and buildings are only the faintest rises under the grit. In either telling, the name
<em>Dens</em> belongs as much to the wilderness as to the town—and some say the two are already the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="archivists-commentary">Archivist’s Commentary</h2>

<p>The accounts refuse to stay separate. “Town” and “wilderness” read like two halves of a circle
our witnesses keep turning through: settlement becoming exile, exile folding back into a harder
settlement. We have no single “before” and “after” here, only a loop of approaches where each
version makes the other legible. Readers who want a stable Dens must accept a moving boundary:
every whole appears only through its parts—and the parts keep drifting.</p>
