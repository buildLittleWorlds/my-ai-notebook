<h2 id="provenance">Provenance</h2>

<p>Tower · Instructor lesson logs (Y18–Y21) and “anomalies register” slips from the Mirado schoolroom;
compiled after puzzle-catechism sessions (“edges to edges”) with follow-up speech observations.</p>

<h2 id="extract">Extract</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Slip 4:</strong> After nine repetitions of the puzzle rule, subject self-prompts correctly.
In free talk, says: “Blue is baby,” then clarifies by pointing to the mother’s apron (blue gingham).
Later in the week: “Apple means mother,” used whenever lunch bell sounds. Instructor notes <em>register-shift</em>:
rule language migrates into kinship talk.</p>

  <p><strong>Slip 7:</strong> Subject whispers “edges to edges” while aligning cutlery; when corrected to
“spoons and spoons,” replies: “Edges are for babies.” Teacher remarks: <em>connotation drift</em>—the procedural
phrase accrues age-value, then social value, without explicit instruction.</p>

  <p><strong>Slip 11:</strong> During picture transfer (pond → cabin), subject names the frame “home”
and refuses “house,” insisting: “Home is when the blue is on.” (Apron absent that day.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="archivists-commentary">Archivist’s Commentary</h2>

<p>The Tower’s drill makes speech lay the track for the hand—but the child’s speech keeps laying tracks of its own.
A procedural rule (“edges to edges”) begets a private lexicon where colors pick up kinship, and steps on a puzzle
board appear as steps toward a person. We file this under <em>Silence &amp; Withdrawal</em> to keep it beside
the catechism notes: repetition builds fit; fit spills into meaning.</p>
