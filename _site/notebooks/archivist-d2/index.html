<h2 id="provenance">Provenance</h2>

<p>Minutes from the Bagbu colloquy (“On Roads”), Capital archives district, with addenda from border
runners; annotations by a junior registrar regarding “journeys that breed journeys.”</p>

<h2 id="extract">Extract</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every true journey begins in the Quarry, they say, and pushes toward the desert and its tower.
But midway a second road buds off inside the first—sometimes years earlier than anyone can date.
The maps cannot agree which is the copy and which is the line. Each path throws another.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="archivists-commentary">Archivist’s Commentary</h2>

<p>We were instructed once to identify an origin and a fork. The slips will not allow it. What looks
like a duplicate keeps making new directions; what looks like a main road is already a seam.
Our ledger overflows whenever we try to count. For Quarry matters we recommend a different verb:
not “to begin,” but “to proliferate.”</p>
