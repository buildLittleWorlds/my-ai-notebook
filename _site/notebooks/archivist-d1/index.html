<h2 id="provenance">Provenance</h2>

<p>Five woodcuts attributed to <em>Castelia</em>, acquired from Capital alley dealers (Lot 41–45).
Dealer bills claim “Yeller Quarry Hunt” origin; two impressions bear alley-stamp ink, one has a
partial chapel watermark. Comparison set includes three postcard-scale copies and one painted
facsimile on tin. Lot intake photographed and dusted; edges measured against known Castelia blocks.</p>

<h2 id="extract--trade--image">Extract — Trade &amp; Image</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The fivefold figure in silhouette… the famous Yeller Quarry Hunt depiction by Castelia.”
Trinket images sold in Capital alleys as patron-saint mementos; more sightings claimed in Dead River,
fewer in the Capital; almost none who claim to have truly seen her.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="findings--block--copy">Findings — Block &amp; Copy</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Block-line:</strong> Two cuts share a burr consistent with Castelia’s late period; three do not.</li>
  <li><strong>Ink &amp; stock:</strong> Alley-ink mix on all; chapel watermark likely a pasted backing.</li>
  <li><strong>Pose-variance:</strong> Silhouettes differ at wrists and jawline; “fivefold” reads as seam, not count.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy-chain:</strong> Postcard set copies the burr but loses the wrist flare; tin facsimile invents both.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="archivists-commentary">Archivist’s Commentary</h2>

<p>The market wants a single cut—an origin to worship. The slips refuse it. Even where the burr
repeats, the wrists don’t; even where the jaw aligns, the paper lies. We file the images as a
chase that throws its own doubles: a line of impressions that will not resolve to first or fifth.
As for the sightings, we keep the trinkets with the testimonies. Both are silhouette-work: light
around a body the ledgers cannot catch.</p>
