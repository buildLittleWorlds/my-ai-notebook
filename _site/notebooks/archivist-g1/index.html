<h2 id="archivists-commentary">Archivist’s Commentary</h2>

<p>Capeast is an after—after work, after city, after festival. We note how arrivals unsettle
the cleanup: five women, same step, no cart, no master, appetite held in reserve. Grievances
rise first to apparel and only then to agency, as if cloth were the hinge of consent. Our
file keeps what the night tried to smooth over: that the women arrived before the story did,
and the story—when it comes—will be forced to catch up to their pace.</p>
