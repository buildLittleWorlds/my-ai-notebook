<h2 id="provenance">Provenance</h2>

<p>Pattern log compiled after the Harvest Festival (Capeast Ward notes, Alley Watch intake);
appended parish protests and market-stall testimonies from the same night.</p>

<h2 id="extract">Extract</h2>

<blockquote>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td> </td>
        <td>“It was a festival night… the night after the festival of harvest… The mapmaker’s women arrived ahead of the mapmaker.”</td>
        <td> </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>|| “The mapmaker’s women were clothed in a pattern that shifted each time they were seen…
covering up one breast on one of the women and leaving the other bare and covering both on all the others
but leaving a core circle on those four women bare on their backs. This brought curiosity and protest
wherever the mapmaker journeyed.” ||</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="archivists-commentary">Archivist’s Commentary</h2>

<p>Capeast files spectacle as ordinance: the same step becomes a citation when cloth turns hinge.
The pattern log shows variety by design—self-chosen fittings—yet the protests read choice as threat,
converting arrival into a paperwork queue. We keep both ledgers: the shifting variants (agency in dress)
and the complaints (agency misread as offense). The women precede their story; the records lag behind,
trying to catch a moving seam with stationary rules.</p>
