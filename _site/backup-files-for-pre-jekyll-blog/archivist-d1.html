      <h1>Archive Post D1 — Yeller Quarry: The Hunt Silhouettes (Castelia woodcuts, provenance file)</h1>

      <p><strong>Catalog Code:</strong> D1</p>

      <h2>Provenance</h2>
      <p>
        Five woodcuts attributed to <em>Castelia</em>, acquired from Capital alley dealers (Lot 41–45).
        Dealer bills claim “Yeller Quarry Hunt” origin; two impressions bear alley-stamp ink, one has a
        partial chapel watermark. Comparison set includes three postcard-scale copies and one painted
        facsimile on tin. Lot intake photographed and dusted; edges measured against known Castelia blocks.
      </p>

      <h2>Extract — Trade &amp; Image</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “The fivefold figure in silhouette… the famous Yeller Quarry Hunt depiction by Castelia.”
        Trinket images sold in Capital alleys as patron-saint mementos; more sightings claimed in Dead River,
        fewer in the Capital; almost none who claim to have truly seen her.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Findings — Block &amp; Copy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Block-line:</strong> Two cuts share a burr consistent with Castelia’s late period; three do not.</li>
        <li><strong>Ink &amp; stock:</strong> Alley-ink mix on all; chapel watermark likely a pasted backing.</li>
        <li><strong>Pose-variance:</strong> Silhouettes differ at wrists and jawline; “fivefold” reads as seam, not count.</li>
        <li><strong>Copy-chain:</strong> Postcard set copies the burr but loses the wrist flare; tin facsimile invents both.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Archivist’s Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        The market wants a single cut—an origin to worship. The slips refuse it. Even where the burr
        repeats, the wrists don’t; even where the jaw aligns, the paper lies. We file the images as a
        chase that throws its own doubles: a line of impressions that will not resolve to first or fifth.
        As for the sightings, we keep the trinkets with the testimonies. Both are silhouette-work: light
        around a body the ledgers cannot catch.
