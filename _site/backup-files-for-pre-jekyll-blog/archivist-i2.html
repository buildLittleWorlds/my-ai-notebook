      <h1>Archive Post I2 — Tower: A Child with Connotations (linguistic anomalies register)</h1>

      <p><strong>Catalog Code:</strong> I2</p>

      <h2>Provenance</h2>
      <p>
        Tower · Instructor lesson logs (Y18–Y21) and “anomalies register” slips from the Mirado schoolroom;
        compiled after puzzle-catechism sessions (“edges to edges”) with follow-up speech observations.
      </p>

      <h2>Extract</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Slip 4:</strong> After nine repetitions of the puzzle rule, subject self-prompts correctly.
        In free talk, says: “Blue is baby,” then clarifies by pointing to the mother’s apron (blue gingham).
        Later in the week: “Apple means mother,” used whenever lunch bell sounds. Instructor notes <em>register-shift</em>:
        rule language migrates into kinship talk.</p>

        <p><strong>Slip 7:</strong> Subject whispers “edges to edges” while aligning cutlery; when corrected to
        “spoons and spoons,” replies: “Edges are for babies.” Teacher remarks: <em>connotation drift</em>—the procedural
        phrase accrues age-value, then social value, without explicit instruction.</p>

        <p><strong>Slip 11:</strong> During picture transfer (pond → cabin), subject names the frame “home”
        and refuses “house,” insisting: “Home is when the blue is on.” (Apron absent that day.)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Archivist’s Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        The Tower’s drill makes speech lay the track for the hand—but the child’s speech keeps laying tracks of its own.
        A procedural rule (“edges to edges”) begets a private lexicon where colors pick up kinship, and steps on a puzzle
        board appear as steps toward a person. We file this under <em>Silence &amp; Withdrawal</em> to keep it beside
        the catechism notes: repetition builds fit; fit spills into meaning.
