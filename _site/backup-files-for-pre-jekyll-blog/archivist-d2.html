      <h1>Archive Post D2 — Yeller Quarry: Bagbu on Roads &amp; Doubles (archive district minutes)</h1>

      <p><strong>Catalog Code:</strong> D2</p>

      <h2>Provenance</h2>
      <p>
        Minutes from the Bagbu colloquy (“On Roads”), Capital archives district, with addenda from border
        runners; annotations by a junior registrar regarding “journeys that breed journeys.”
      </p>

      <h2>Extract</h2>
      <blockquote>
        Every true journey begins in the Quarry, they say, and pushes toward the desert and its tower.
        But midway a second road buds off inside the first—sometimes years earlier than anyone can date.
        The maps cannot agree which is the copy and which is the line. Each path throws another.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Archivist’s Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        We were instructed once to identify an origin and a fork. The slips will not allow it. What looks
        like a duplicate keeps making new directions; what looks like a main road is already a seam.
        Our ledger overflows whenever we try to count. For Quarry matters we recommend a different verb:
        not “to begin,” but “to proliferate.”
