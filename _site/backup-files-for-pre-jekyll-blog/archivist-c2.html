Commentary: Skill is secrecy here; tuning becomes a kind of silence.</code></pre>

          Notes: Keep contradictions between cards; do not reconcile. Conflicts are evidence.

      <h2>Extract</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Card 1 (ditch marker 7):</strong> || Woman with shaved head, leather apron. Turned a bone wheel by hand; said it would “catch” if we spoke. ||</p>
        <p><strong>Card 2 (stall behind the mill):</strong> || Lines on scalp like letters or tracks. Paid for a cog with a ring from a child’s toy. Refused stew; asked for wire. ||</p>
        <p><strong>Card 3 (tavern stool, Densmok):</strong> || “She’s the one pulled the mapmaker out of the gutter once. Fed him leathery stew. Told him Dens spits out saints by accident.” ||</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Archivist’s Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        She arrives as a mechanic and leaves as a rumor. The cards disagree on her marks (letters or tracks),
        agree on her refusals (food, talk). We file under <em>Violence &amp; Secret Life</em> for the shaved head
        and the tool that hushes speech, cross-listed to <em>Mediation &amp; Aperture</em> for the way she tunes a wheel
        like a window—letting force through, not bodies. The contradictions are the sighting.
