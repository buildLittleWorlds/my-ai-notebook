      <h1>Archive Post F2 — Dead River / 5000s: R. Levins Overlap (school folios, sandbox memos)</h1>

      <p><strong>Catalog Code:</strong> F2</p>

      <h2>Provenance</h2>
      <p>
        Compiled from <em>Dead River</em> school folios (“5000s” set), Capeast sandbox memos referencing
        Ria Levins’s early work, and alley-shop ephemera linking Yeller silhouettes to Dead River routes.
      </p>

      <h2>Extract</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>|| “One possibility is to make 5000s the only place where Ria’s Dead River work and the Capeast School overlap…
        Maybe it’s early work by Ria playing in the Densworld sandbox before doing her own thing.” ||</p>
        <p>|| “You will have heard of Yeller… the fivefold figure in silhouette… how can a single fivefold being—
        five women-one being—maintain itself over generations?… Though what you might ask is whether the man in the
        pickbox cart might be himself some kind of immortal…” ||</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Archivist’s Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        The overlap is not a merger but a pressure point: Capeast pedagogy brushes the Dead River mythos and
        leaves a seam that later readers misname as origin. The fivefold Yeller and the pickbox man turn the
        question of “continuity” inside out—are we tracking persons, or patterns? For the 5000s we file the overlap
        as a rehearsal space where an artist’s method (Levins) tests the market’s silhouettes (Yeller) and the cart’s
        interior world (pickbox) without resolving who lasts. The dossier keeps the seam visible so later datings
        don’t harden into firsts.
