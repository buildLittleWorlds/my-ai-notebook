      <h1>Archive Post E1 — North Town: Murder Songs Index (first lines &amp; field recordings)</h1>

      <p><strong>Catalog Code:</strong> E1</p>

      <h2>Provenance</h2>
      <p>
        Lane-collector spools from the North road (wax &amp; aluminum, mixed quality); stool-transcripts from taverns
        between Gee Road and the Quarry line; two parish songbooks (loose-leaf, weather damage). Compiled by the
        North Desk, with cross-notes to the Northo “Lives” folio and three depositions referencing the mapmaker’s cart.
      </p>

      <h2>Extract</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“Singers show up, come from North Town more than any other borough. Why? Murder songs.”</p>
        <p>“The principle of North Town is living a secret life — serial killer only being one of the more obvious variety.”</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Archivist’s Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        The singers carry two ledgers at once: melody for the square, confession for the alley. Many of the
        North songs turn on a small instrument—knife, creek, borrowed name—then open a second life under the first,
        where the “missionary” voice courts and conceals. Our task is not to decide who kills, only to preserve
        the split. We file doubled takes beside clean ones, and keep the hums, because the hum is how the road
        remembers who passed over it.
