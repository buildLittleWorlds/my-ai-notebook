      <h1>Archive Post B2 — Densmok: Two Kinds of Story about Dens (oral histories, stool transcripts)</h1>

      <p><strong>Catalog Code:</strong> B2</p>

      <h2>Provenance</h2>
      <p>
        Compiled from west-edge Densmok stool transcripts and lane interviews; cross-checked with
        ditch-readers’ ledgers and three roadside sermons recovered from the north spur into Dens.
      </p>

      <h2>Extract</h2>
      <blockquote>
        There are two kinds of story you’ll hear about Dens.
        In one: a regular town—dirty, small, out on the edge.
        In the other: the wilderness itself is alive, thickening by the day, pushing up against houses
        until streets and buildings are only the faintest rises under the grit. In either telling, the name
        <em>Dens</em> belongs as much to the wilderness as to the town—and some say the two are already the same.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Archivist’s Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        The accounts refuse to stay separate. “Town” and “wilderness” read like two halves of a circle
        our witnesses keep turning through: settlement becoming exile, exile folding back into a harder
        settlement. We have no single “before” and “after” here, only a loop of approaches where each
        version makes the other legible. Readers who want a stable Dens must accept a moving boundary:
        every whole appears only through its parts—and the parts keep drifting.
      </p>
