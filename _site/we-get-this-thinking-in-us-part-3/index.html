  <h2>24 We Get This Thinking in Us - Part 3</h2>
  <p>So, what does a structuralist make of the phrase “we get this thinking in us”? From a Saussurean perspective, Julia McCoy’s accidental passive phrasing isn’t a slip-up. It’s an unintentional moment of profound accuracy. It reveals the mechanics of how ideology and social change actually work.</p>

<p>Her overt message is individualistic: “You must choose to think this new way.” But her grammar reveals the structuralist truth: We are inhabited by systems of thought. A <em>langue</em> is not something we create; it is a “social product” we receive. It gets “in us.” Her project is not to persuade individuals one by one, but to replace the entire dominant <em>langue</em> of “industrialism” with a new one of “AI abundance.”</p>

<p>She is trying to install a new network of signs, with new values defined by new oppositions. Once the new system is “in us,” it will operate automatically, structuring our perceptions and responses without our conscious effort. The goal is for the new thinking to become as natural and invisible as the old one was.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIMw04GJJ7U&amp;t=1059s">Elan Barenholtz’s</a> discomfort becomes so illuminating. He senses the presence of this autonomous system and finds it “uncomfortable,” even “parasitic.” He concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…whatever that system is whatever that informational organism that’s doing the talking doesn’t really live in my body or certainly not my body alone… it belongs to some collective system some informational system that a is larger than me…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the system. McCoy wants to replace the current “informational organism” with a new one she believes is better. Her phrase “get this thinking in us” perfectly describes the process of that implantation. A structuralist would argue that this is what is always happening. We are always being spoken by a system larger than ourselves. The only question is which system it is.</p>
