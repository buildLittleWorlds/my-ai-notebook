  <h2>95 The Politics of Saying Nothing (Žižek's Bartleby)</h2>
  <p>In the <a href="/post-94">last post</a>, we saw Gilles Deleuze’s Bartleby as a creative force, a “new man” whose strange formula opens the door to a new kind of community. The philosopher Slavoj Žižek looks at the same quiet scrivener and sees something very different. While both agree that Bartleby is a radical figure who breaks the system, Žižek is less interested in the new world Bartleby creates and more interested in the old one he violently destroys.</p>

<p>Žižek’s analysis (I’m drawing on <a href="https://thedangerousmaybe.medium.com/i-would-prefer-not-to-%C5%BEi%C5%BEeks-bartleby-politics-12bd8d9de66a">this</a> for my summary) begins with a critique of what he calls “pseudo-activity.” Most forms of protest (marches, petitions, online outrage) are, for him, a kind of Foucault-style “resistance” that the system has already accounted for. These acts make us feel like we’re doing something, but they ultimately reinforce the power structure they claim to oppose. Bartleby’s refusal is of a completely different order. He does not protest; he does not argue. He simply withdraws.</p>

<p>This is the core of Žižek’s “politics of subtraction.” Bartleby’s power lies in his refusal to participate in the ideological game at all. A system of power runs on our libidinal investment in it; we get a certain “enjoyment” (<em>jouissance</em>) even from resisting it. Bartleby subtracts this enjoyment entirely. By refusing to play, by refusing even to get angry or to make demands, he reveals the fundamental emptiness of the game itself. He starves the system of the very psychic energy it needs to function.</p>

<p>Where Deleuze sees the affirmation of a “new man,” Žižek sees the power of a pure, voided subject. The point is not to become someone new, but to become, politically, no one. Bartleby’s act is a gesture of pure, violent negativity that creates the empty space where a true political “Act” might become possible. It is not about building a new world but about demonstrating the absolute deadlock of the current one. In this reading, Bartleby is not the hopeful figure of the “Deep Opt-In,” but the terrifyingly consistent embodiment of the “Deep Opt-Out,” a refusal so total that it clears the board completely.</p>
