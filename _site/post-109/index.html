  <h2>109 Objection 1: "Students Won't Learn to Write"</h2>
  <p><strong>The objection:</strong> If students use AI to write, they will not learn how to write themselves. Professors are responsible for teaching writing, so they must prevent shortcuts that bypass the learning process.</p>

<p>At first glance, this objection has force. Professors want their students to develop skills. They don’t want them to cheat themselves of practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="applying-mills-principle">Applying Mill’s Principle</h3>

<p>Students come to university with diverse aims. One may want to develop sentence-level craft; another may want to learn how to supervise and edit machine-assisted writing; another may want to master research acceleration with AI. All of these are legitimate intellectual goals.</p>

<p>The objection assumes there is only one valid end: learning to write by hand, word by word. But Mill teaches that ends belong to the individual. Professors should not compel students to pursue <em>their</em> vision of what the student’s goals should be.</p>

<p>Yes, professors are guides. But their role is not to dictate purposes. Their role is to act as a support for the student’s own intellectual life, helping them achieve what <em>they</em> see as valuable, within clear anti-deception rules (e.g., no plagiarism).</p>

<h3 id="my-response">My Response</h3>

<p>If a student decides that learning how to use AI effectively is the most valuable skill for them, then that is a legitimate use of their education. The professor’s duty is not to block that choice but to help the student pursue it as well as possible: designing assignments that make supervision, editing, verification, and critical judgment visible and assessable, rather than banning the tool.</p>

<p>In Mill’s terms, society “gains more” when individuals are allowed to live and learn “as seems good to themselves.” Restrictions that enforce one pedagogical path (on the theory that it is universally best) produce conformity more than flourishing. Guard the boundary against <em>harms</em> (fraud, misrepresentation); within that boundary, leave method to the student.</p>
