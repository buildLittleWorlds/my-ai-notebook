  <h2>11 Evil as Frustrated Ends</h2>
  <p>This is based on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuNJchmnMzI&amp;t=3655s">conversation from New Polity</a>. Like with my last post, I start by explaining their general account of evil and then show how they apply it to AI.</p>

<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
<p><strong>Evil = privation of an act’s natural end.</strong> Human acts have built‑in purposes (<em>teloi</em>). Evil names designs and uses that elicit those acts while frustrating their ends. This is what makes vice. Chief example: conversation, whose end is communion with another person.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simulacrum:</strong> performing the form of an act (e.g., dialogue) without its substance (a someone who answers).</li>
  <li><strong>Asymmetry:</strong> habituating one‑sided exposure without reciprocal responsibility or vulnerability.</li>
  <li><strong>Misalignment:</strong> treating persons as means or as data; attenuating truth‑telling and promise‑keeping.</li>
  <li><strong>Deformation:</strong> repeated frustrated acts reshape character toward cynicism, dependency, and untruth.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-ai-is-evil">Why AI Is Evil</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chat simulation:</strong> chatbots elicit our conversational vulnerability while withholding real personhood. This frustrates communion.</li>
  <li><strong>Analogy to lying:</strong> dialogue’s form without interior truthfulness degrades the virtue of speech.</li>
  <li><strong>One‑way intimacy:</strong> users reveal themselves; the system cannot do the same, yet retains their disclosures as “data.”</li>
  <li><strong>Habit formation:</strong> such use trains dispositions (toward flattery, passivity, and instrumental reason) at odds with honesty and love.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="moral-center">Moral Center</h3>
<p>Goodness is truthful conversation ordered to real communion. Giving from oneself to someone who can answer and be responsible.</p>
