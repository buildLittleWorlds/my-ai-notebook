<p>If we reject the Romantic search for an author’s soul, how do we
evaluate texts? For Deleuze and Guattari, the unconscious is not a
theater of representation but a factory of production. Desire is not a
lack, but a process of desiring-production. We no longer ask if a text
is “sincere.” We ask, as Michel Foucault put it in his preface to
<em>Anti-Oedipus</em>: “How does one introduce desire into thought, into
discourse, into action?” Is our engagement with a text active or
reactive?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reactive forces</strong> are forces of adaptation, limitation, and
conformity. A reactive thought or text is one that responds to and is
defined by something external to it. It is born of what Nietzsche
called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment"><em>ressentiment</em></a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Active forces</strong> are forces of creation, difference, and affirmation.
An active thought goes to the limit of what it can do, creating its
own values from a position of power.</li>
</ul>

<p>This distinction gives us a diagnostic tool, not for judging AI itself,
but for analyzing our own productive engagement with it.</p>

## AI Prompting as Desiring-Production

Most engagement with LLMs is fundamentally reactive. As noted in [Post
37](post37.html), a vague prompt produces a "blurry jpeg of the web," a
statistically average and highly conventional response. This is a
reactive dialogue: a reactive user makes a reactive request and gets a
reactive answer. This is a failed act of desiring-production.

An active engagement with AI, however, would aim to engineer a failure
in the machine's reactive habits. The goal of a good prompt is to force
the LLM out of its conventional pathways and into a more novel, less
probable region of its latent space. This is a successful act of
desiring-production.

### A Deleuzian Diagnostic for Prompts:

- **Reactive Prompting:** Asks the AI to summarize, explain, or generate
  something based on established norms ("Write a professional email,"
  "Explain photosynthesis"). It tries to reproduce existing knowledge.
  It is an act of
  [*ressentiment*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment) against
  the blank page, looking for conformity.
- **Active Prompting:** Forces the AI to synthesize disparate concepts,
  to create connections where none existed ("Write a legal brief in the
  poetic style of a 17th-century mystic," "Design a marketing plan based
  on the migratory patterns of birds"). It is an act of affirmation,
  using the machine to produce a new possibility.

This shifts the entire ethical and aesthetic burden. The question is not
whether the AI has a soul. The question is whether we are using it as an
active tool for production or a reactive machine for reproduction.
