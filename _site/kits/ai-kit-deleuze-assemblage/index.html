<p>Previous pages have established the AI text as an impersonal,
<a href="/my-ai-notebook/kits/ai-kit-deleuze-goodwill/">productive machine</a> whose output can be
either <a href="/my-ai-notebook/kits/ai-kit-deleuze-forces/">reactive or active</a>, emerging from a
system of <a href="/my-ai-notebook/kits/ai-kit-deleuze-monotony/">monotonous repetition</a>. The
final step is to stop seeing the human and the AI as separate entities.
The Deleuzian move is to analyze the functional unit they create
together: the <em>Human-AI Assemblage</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>Anti-Oedipus</em>, a “desiring-machine” is not a metaphor. It is any
system of connections, flows, and breaks that produces something. When a
user prompts an LLM, they are not merely “using a tool”; they are
forming an assemblage, a new, temporary desiring-machine.</p>

## How the Assemblage Works

This new machine functions through a circuit of production:

1.  **The Human Flow:** The user introduces a flow of language,
    intention, and cultural context into the system (the prompt).
2.  **Connecting to the Body without Organs:** The prompt connects to
    the LLM's "latent space," its vast, non-hierarchical field of
    potential linguistic connections. This is the AI's Body without
    Organs, a plane of pure potential.
3.  **The AI Flow:** The AI produces a flow of statistically probable,
    patterned text, drawing connections across its system of possible
    meanings.
4.  **The Human as Operator (Cutting and Selecting):** The user
    interrupts this flow. They select, edit, delete, and re-prompt. Each
    of these actions is a "cut" in the machinic process, redirecting
    production. A new output is generated, and the cycle continues.

In this model, authorship is distributed across the entire assemblage.
Meaning is not recovered from a soul but produced by the circuit. The
focus shifts from the Romantic question "Who is the author?" to the
Deleuzian question "How does it work, and what does it produce?"

## A Diagnostic for the Assemblage

This model allows us to diagnose our own use of AI. Are we forming a
repressive machine or a revolutionary one?

- **The Subjugated Assemblage (Reactive):** The user acts as a simple
  operator. The prompts are conventional, the goals reproductive. The
  human becomes a cog in a machine that reproduces the most generic
  social codes. The assemblage is "subjugated" to existing norms.
- **The Subject-Group Assemblage (Active):** The user and the AI form a
  creative unit. The prompts are experimental, forcing novel
  connections. The user actively cuts and redirects the flows to produce
  something new. This assemblage functions like what Deleuze and
  Guattari called a "subject-group"—a collective capable of producing a
  new reality, a new line of flight.

The debate over AI's authenticity is a red herring. AI is not a subject
to be interrogated, but a component to be connected. The crucial
question is not what AI is, but what we become when we connect to it.
What new desiring-machines are we building?
