<p>The suggestion that AI-generated texts might be “dangerous” often sounds
like a uniquely 21st-century alarm. But the belief that texts can be
transformative (and dangerous) is one of the oldest ideas in
intellectual history. Societies have long recognized that certain forms
of discourse can challenge established truths and reshape human
consciousness, for better or for worse. To think clearly about the
potential risks of AI, we must first place them in this long tradition.</p>

## Plato's Fear of Poetry: The Original "Dangerous Text"

The Western tradition's concern with textual danger begins with Plato.
In *The Republic*, he famously argued for the censorship of poets in his
ideal state. His reasoning was explicitly hermeneutic: he believed that
art was dangerous because it bypasses reason and appeals directly to the
emotions. He feared that mimetic art—art that imitates reality—could
plant falsehoods in the souls of citizens, corrupting their character
and undermining the stability of the state. For Plato, the danger of art
was a direct consequence of its interpretive power.

## Heresy, Blasphemy, and the Power of the Word

For centuries, religious and political authorities have sought to
control texts precisely because they believe in their power to change
minds and inspire action. The history of heresy is a history of
"dangerous" interpretations of sacred texts. Institutions like the
Catholic Church's [*Index Librorum
Prohibitorum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum)
(Index of Prohibited Books) were founded on the principle that unchecked
reading could lead individuals astray and threaten the salvation of
their souls. Similarly, the prosecution of blasphemy and the censorship
of political dissent are acts that affirm the belief that words are not
neutral—they have real-world power to disrupt and transform.

## A Modern Hermeneutic View of Textual Power

Contemporary hermeneutics provides an intellectual system for
understanding this power in secular terms. Following Paul Ricoeur, we
can understand a powerful text as one that projects a "world of the
text." This is not just a collection of information, but a coherent,
inhabitable reality that the reader can enter through the act of
interpretation.

A "dangerous" book, in this view, is one whose projected world is so
compelling that it can radically alter the reader's own world.

- A revolutionary political tract projects a world where current
  injustices are intolerable and a new social order is possible.
- A profound philosophical work projects a world where our common-sense
  assumptions are revealed as illusions.
- A great novel projects a world that can permanently reconfigure our
  capacity for empathy.

The "danger" of a text is directly proportional to its power to perform
what Hans-Georg Gadamer called a "fusion of horizons"—the ability to
fundamentally change the reader's perspective. A book that cannot change
you (and is not "dangerous" in this sense) is maybe just not worth
reading. The perceived risk of AI-generated text is not a new problem,
but a new instance of an ancient one: how do we engage with media that
has the capacity to remake us?
