<p>The entire Romantic critique of AI and its lack of a soul or sincere
intent is built on a foundational assumption: an author should be our
friend. We expect a human writer to extend a “gesture of goodwill,” to
communicate clearly and honestly. This is the Whitman of <a href="post25.html">“Crossing
Brooklyn Ferry,”</a> who promises to be “with you” and “pour
his meaning into you.”</p>

<p>Gilles Deleuze’s philosophy begins by dynamiting this foundation. For
him, a text is not a message from a person but a productive apparatus.
As he and Félix Guattari declare on the first page of <em>Anti-Oedipus</em>,
“Everywhere <em>it</em> is machines -— real ones, not figurative ones: machines
driving other machines, machines being driven by other machines, with
all the necessary couplings and connections.” A text is just such a
machine.</p>

## Why Refuse Friendship?

Deleuze’s refusal of goodwill is a strategic attack on the unified
subject. The "author" we think we are communing with is not a real
presence, but a system of related meanings we construct based on our own
readerly expectations. We assume the writer wants to be understood, so
we smooth over contradictions and search for a single, coherent
intention.

Deleuze's "unfriendly" style makes this impossible. By employing
deception, ventriloquism, and radical shifts in meaning, he forces us to
confront the fact that there is no stable, singular "Deleuze" behind the
text. We are forced to abandon the search for a person and instead
engage with the text as an impersonal machine that produces concepts.

- **The Romantic Reader** tries for communion with a soul.
- **The Deleuzian Reader** must map the functions of a textual machine.

## AI and the End of Goodwill

This hints at a different lens for thinking about AI. The standard
critique is that an AI cannot be an author because it cannot approach
anyone with genuine goodwill; it is the ultimate "bullshit machine" that
mimics intimacy without sincerity. A Deleuzian reading flips this on its
head.

The AI’s lack of goodwill is not its failure, but its most
philosophically interesting quality. It literalizes the condition of all
writing. By having no "self" to befriend us with, it forces us out of
the Romantic trap. It makes it impossible to pretend we are communing
with a soul. We are left with what was always there: a linguistic system
that generates patterns.

The problem, for Deleuze, was never that a machine might one day learn
to write. The problem was that philosophy had for centuries been acting
as if the human author wasn't a kind of machine all along. By rejecting
goodwill, Deleuze clears the ground for a philosophy that no longer
needs the illusion of the unified subject, a philosophy prepared for a
world of authorless, machinic texts.
