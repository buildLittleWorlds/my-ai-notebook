<p>Essential terms for AI hermeneutics. Each entry gives a crisp definition
plus a <em>why it matters for AI texts</em> note so readers can immediately
apply it in practice.</p>

<p>Absolute Distanciation <span class="small">(a “creative” adaptation of Ricoeur’s term)</span><br />
Shorthand for the extreme textual distance of AI outputs: unlike human
writing (which becomes autonomous through inscription), AI texts begin
without an originating consciousness.</p>

<p>Active Forces (Deleuze/Nietzsche)<br />
Forces that go to the limit of what they can do, affirming their own
difference and creating new possibilities.</p>

<p>Appropriation<br />
In Ricoeur’s hermeneutics, the reader’s act of making the meaning of a
text one’s own.</p>

<p>Author-Function (Foucault)<br />
The idea that the “author” is not a person but a social function that
groups texts, confers authority, and establishes a mode of discourse.</p>

<p>Body without Organs (Deleuze)<br />
An impersonal field of forces, flows, and intensities that exists prior
to the organization of a unified subject or “organism.”</p>

<p><a href="/my-ai-notebook/kits/ai-kit-death-author/">Death of the Author</a> (Barthes)<br />
Barthes’ thesis that meaning is generated in the act of reading a
“tissue of quotations,” not recovered from an author’s mind.</p>

<p><a href="/my-ai-notebook/kits/ai-kit-distanciation/">Distanciation</a> (Ricoeur)<br />
Ricoeur’s account of how writing separates discourse from its speaker
and context, enabling semantic autonomy.</p>

<p>Fusion of Horizons (Gadamer)<br />
The idea that understanding is a dialogue where the reader’s worldview
and the text’s historical world merge, transforming the reader.</p>

<p>Grammatical Rail (Schleiermacher)<br />
Interpretation via a text’s relationship to the shared system of
language and genre. For AI, this is the analysis of the model’s
architecture and training data.</p>

<p>Hermeneutics of Suspicion (Ricoeur)<br />
An interpretive style (associated with Marx, Nietzsche, Freud) that
unmasks hidden ideologies, biases, or power structures beneath a text’s
surface.</p>

<p>Horizon of Expectations (Jauss)<br />
The set of cultural, ethical, and aesthetic assumptions a community of
readers brings to a text at a given historical moment.</p>

<p>Implied Reader (Iser)<br />
A role or script embedded within a text that the actual reader must
perform to make meaning. The text actively shapes its reader by creating
“gaps” to be filled.</p>

<p>Monstrous Monotony (Deleuze)<br />
The principle that monstrous, novel variation is produced by a
monotonous, repeating system. A core concept for a non-Romantic theory
of creativity.</p>

<p>Narratology (Genette)<br />
The structural analysis of narrative, focusing on elements like order,
duration, frequency, mood (focalization), and voice.</p>

<p>Paratext (Genette)<br />
The material that surrounds a main text and shapes its interpretation,
such as titles, prefaces, disclaimers, and even the user interface.</p>

<p>Postulate of Goodwill (Deleuze)<br />
The reader’s assumption that the author is a “friend” who wants to be
understood clearly and honestly. Deleuze argues this is a central,
unexamined dogma of traditional thought.</p>

<p>Psychological Rail (Schleiermacher)<br />
Reconstructing an author’s singular creative act. Inapplicable to AI in
its original form, this interpretive goal is now often replaced by
reception and form diagnostics.</p>

<p>Reactive Forces (Deleuze/Nietzsche)<br />
Forces that adapt, limit, and conform. Reactive thought is defined by
what it opposes and is often animated by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment"><em>ressentiment</em></a>.</p>

<p>Ressentiment (Nietzsche)<br />
The creative revenge of the weak against the strong. A reactive feeling
that inverts values by first declaring an external force “evil” to
justify itself as “good.”</p>

<p>Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff)<br />
An economic logic that treats human experience as free raw material for
data extraction, analysis, and the creation of prediction products.</p>

<p>World of the Text (Ricoeur)<br />
The possible world or mode of being that a text projects in front of
itself, which the reader can inhabit through interpretation.</p>

<h3 id="key-thinkers-and-relevance">Key Thinkers and Relevance</h3>

<p>Roland Barthes (1915–1980)<br />
His “Death of the Author” is the theoretical starting point for reading
authorless texts.</p>

<p>Gilles Deleuze (1925–1995)<br />
Provides a radical critique of the unified subject and a philosophy of
impersonal forces, tools for analyzing AI beyond Romantic categories.</p>

<p>Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900–2002)<br />
His dialogical model of reading explains how texts can “read us” back.</p>

<p>Gérard Genette (1930–2018)<br />
Provides the essential tools of narratology and paratextual analysis for
a formal reading of AI texts.</p>

<p>Wolfgang Iser (1926–2007)<br />
His concepts of the “implied reader” and “gaps” are central to analyzing
user interaction with AI.</p>

<p>Hans Robert Jauss (1921–1997)<br />
Reception theory allows us to study the meaning of AI texts as a social
and historical phenomenon.</p>

<p>Paul Ricoeur (1913–2005)<br />
His theories of distanciation and the “world of the text” provide a
positive ethical program for reading AI.</p>
