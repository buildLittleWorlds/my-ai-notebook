<p>An interesting confrontation between a Romantic worldview and a
Deleuzian one comes down to a single, paradoxical concept: monstrous
monotony. For the Romantics, creativity springs from a singular soul.
For Deleuze, creation emerges from an impersonal, repeating system. An
AI, in this light, is not a failed Romantic author; it is a perfect
Deleuzian machine.</p>

## Bare Repetition vs. Repetition for Itself

In *Difference and Repetition*, Deleuze distinguishes between two types
of repetition. One is "bare repetition," the mechanical reproduction of
the same. The other is a deeper repetition "for itself," a repetition
that contains and produces difference. This provides a precise model for
AI:

- **Monotony (Bare Repetition):** An LLM is a fixed architecture and a
  finite (though vast) training set. When prompted reactively, it
  produces statistically average text. This is the "bare repetition" of
  the Same that the Romantic critic points to as proof that AI is a
  soulless parrot.
- **Monstrosity (Repetition of Difference):** This monotony is the
  engine of its creativity. The system is a field of pure difference. An
  active prompt forces it to traverse this field in a novel way,
  producing monstrous, novel variation. Creation emerges not from a soul
  expressing itself, but from a repeating system being pushed to produce
  a new difference.

The AI text is a perfect example of discourse from a Body without
Organs, a field of impersonal flows and intensities that precedes the
formation of a unified subject. Its language flows not from a soul, but
from a system of differential repetition. The "hollowness" that a
Romantic reader feels is not an absence of humanity, but the presence of
the impersonal, machinic process that, for Deleuze, was always at the
heart of creation.

AI is not a parody of the human author. It is a mirror that reveals the
human author to have been a different kind of machine all along, one
whose own "monstrous" creativity is the product of a "monotonous" system
of language, culture, and unconscious forces.
