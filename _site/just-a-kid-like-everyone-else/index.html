  <h2>49 Just a Kid Like Everyone Else</h2>
  <p>Another reading of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg">“Hero”</a>. This one’s not about systems. It’s about psychology. Take this line: “But I’m a kid like everyone else.” The line’s a dodge. It sounds vulnerable and authentic but the guy’s protecting himself.</p>

<p>The statement is false. The man in the video is not a kid. He’s a father with visible responsibilities and a history including a former partner and a child. Claiming to be a kid in this context is deflection. It’s refusing to take on burdens. By identifying with adolescence, he absolves himself of expectations. He gets out of providing stability, sacrificing what he might want for the good of others. The line “I don’t want to be your hero” isn’t a deep rejection of a bullshit ideal of made-up heroism. It’s not hard-nosed realism. It’s personal rejection with cowardice mixed in: “I don’t want to take on the responsibilities that come with being your hero.”</p>

<p>The video gives us a visual for this. At 0:51, we see him riding a shopping cart in the grocery parking lot. It’s performative immaturity. It’s fun and carefree because it contrasts with the adult realities of his life. It’s also a simple visual echo of the rodeo. (Is this just a guy who really likes to ride things?) Is the rodeo an escape into a world where he can live out a built-in childhood fantasy? The rodeo displays a simpler, more dramatic form of heroism (a few seconds of intense bravery) than the sustained, mundane, and thankless heroism of being a present and reliable father.</p>

<p>From this angle, the song’s title is pretty ironic. The “hero” is a persona he adopts in the arena to avoid the more difficult work of being a father. The entire song is his justification for his choice, an anthem for the allure of perpetual adolescence. Framed as pursuing personal freedom, being a kid like everyone else is what prevents him from being what his daughter likely needs him to be. Not a “big man,” not a rodeo star. The title states outright what she would unironically want.</p>
