  <h2>81 Watering the Poisoned Seed</h2>
  <p>The pragmatic objection, outlined in the <a href="/post-80">last post</a>, is a really important challenge. And it’s probably got a lot of truth to it. It argues that modern audiences have a de-mythologized view of art as an industrial product, and that boycotts are simply targeted economic actions against a brand. While it is true that art is produced collaboratively and operates within a market, this view fails to think in a careful way about the logic of our engagement with it. Even in a mechanical age, we seem unable to shake the hunt for a singular, unifying vision.</p>

<p>This is where the Romantic concept of the <a href="/post-75"><em>Keimentschluß</em>, or “seminal decision,”</a> reasserts its power. We may know that a film is the product of a thousand technicians, but we still speak of “a Christopher Nolan film.” We attribute the success or failure of a television series to its “showrunner.” The logic of our criticism and consumption still attempts an organizing principle, a singular consciousness from which the work’s unifying vision unfolds. We still search, in other words, for <em>the</em> origin.</p>

<p>The Romantic insists that this is not just a convenient shorthand. It is a recognition that a successful work of art feels <a href="/romantic-kit-organic-form">organic</a>, not like a “mechanical assembly of discrete, interchangeable parts.” When we boycott a film because of its director, we are not just targeting a CEO; we are rejecting the work’s principle of life, its generative soul.</p>

<p>This organic model is precisely what makes the idea of “economic contamination” so coherent and potent. If the artwork were merely an industrial product, then purchasing it would be a morally neutral transaction. But if it is the living incarnation of its creator’s <em>Keimentschluß</em>, then the economic act becomes one of profound moral significance. To pay for the art is to “water the poisoned seed.” The money is transformed into the lifeblood that sustains a particular spiritual orientation in the world. The complicity is not merely economic; it is spiritual, a direct nourishing of a corrupt generative source. The pragmatic objection fails because it underestimates the enduring power of the organic model of authorship it claims we have outgrown.</p>
