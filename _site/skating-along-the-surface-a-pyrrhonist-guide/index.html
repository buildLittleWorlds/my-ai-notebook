  <h2>92 Skating Along the Surface: A Pyrrhonist Guide</h2>
  <p>After exploring the commitments of the deep opt-in and the deep opt-out, it’s time to work out a defense of the <a href="/post-63">third path</a>: skating along the surface. To do this, we can look at an ancient Greek tradition that perfected it. Pyrrhonism is not a set of doctrines to be learned, but an <em>agōgē</em>, a way of life, a disposition, and a practice. Its purpose is not to find the truth but to cure the mental distress that comes from believing you must.</p>

<p>The key figure is Pyrrho of Elis (c. 365-275 BCE), but since he wrote nothing, our understanding comes from later followers, most importantly Sextus Empiricus. For them, the philosopher is a “zetetic,” or seeker, who is defined by their commitment to “continuing to investigate.”</p>

<p>The Pyrrhonist practice is a repeatable psychological process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It begins when “men of talent,” perturbed by contradictions in the world, set out to find what is true and what is false, hoping to find peace of mind.</li>
  <li>In their investigation, they discover <em>isosthenia</em>, or equipollence: for any claim about the true nature of things, an opposing argument of equal persuasive force can be found.</li>
  <li>Faced with this intellectual deadlock, the honest response is <em>epoché</em>, the suspension of judgment. You neither affirm nor deny the claim.</li>
  <li>Finally, a profound state of <em>ataraxia</em>, or tranquility, follows the suspension of judgment “as a shadow follows a body”. Peace of mind arrives as an unexpected byproduct of giving up the search for it in dogmatic belief.</li>
</ul>

<p>This might work as a basis for the skater’s mindset. The AI debate, with its utopian versus dystopian conclusions, is a perfect case of <em>isosthenia</em>. The skater’s refusal to get pulled into the hype is a modern practice of <em>epoché</em>. The goal of “waiting for the fever to break” is a search for <em>ataraxia</em>. But this raises the objection brought against skeptics for millennia: is such a life actually livable? If you suspend belief, won’t you be paralyzed and unable to act?</p>
