  <h2>61 A Conflict of Interpretations: Ricoeur's Method for Reading AI</h2>
  <p>To make sense of any complex text, whether it’s a dream, a myth, or an AI’s output, we need a method. The philosopher Paul Ricoeur, in his landmark book <em>Freud and Philosophy</em>, provides one. He argues that modern interpretation is defined by a fundamental conflict between two opposing approaches. Understanding this conflict doesn’t just clarify how we read old texts; it gives us a way to interpret the new texts generated by artificial intelligence.</p>

<h3 id="the-two-schools-suspicion-and-recollection">The Two Schools: Suspicion and Recollection</h3>

<p>Ricoeur frames the landscape of interpretation as a battlefield between two “schools of thought.”</p>

<p>First is the <strong>hermeneutics of suspicion</strong>. Its masters are Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. This approach treats the surface meaning of a text as a mask, a “false consciousness” that conceals a deeper, often less noble, reality. For the school of suspicion, to interpret is to unmask, to demystify, to reduce illusions. The goal is to look <em>through</em> the text to find the hidden forces (economic, psychological, or power-driven) that produced it. It is a reductive, “archeological” reading that digs down to the origins.</p>

<p>Opposing this is the <strong>hermeneutics of recollection</strong>. This school, which Ricoeur associates with the phenomenology of religion, approaches a text not as a mask to be torn off but as a symbol to be heard. It tries to restore a meaning that has been forgotten or obscured. For this school, a symbol is not just a disguise for something else; it’s a “manifestation of a depth that both shows and hides itself.” To interpret is to listen for a message, to aim for a “second naiveté” where the symbol “gives rise to thought.” It is a restorative, “teleological” reading that looks forward to the meaning a text makes possible.</p>

<h3 id="a-preliminary-hermeneutic-for-ai-texts">A Preliminary Hermeneutic for AI Texts</h3>

<p>Ricoeur’s “conflict of interpretations” is not a problem to be solved but a tension to be inhabited. A robust hermeneutic for AI must consciously use both methods, moving between them in a dialectical dance.</p>

<p>We begin with the <strong>hermeneutics of suspicion</strong>. This is the natural starting point for any critical engagement with AI. We treat the AI’s output as a product of hidden, non-human forces. We ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the statistical patterns, biases, and limitations of its training data?</li>
  <li>How is the text merely a sophisticated fulfillment of my prompt?</li>
  <li>Where does it reveal its mechanical nature through generic phrasing, factual errors (“hallucinations”), or a lack of grounded understanding?</li>
</ul>

<p>This reductive reading is essential. It’s our “archeology,” grounding our analysis in the material reality of the technology. It prevents us from naively anthropomorphizing the AI and treating its output as the product of a conscious mind.</p>

<p>But we cannot stop there. We must then pivot to the <strong>hermeneutics of recollection</strong>. We bracket the question of the AI’s “intent” and instead treat its output as a cultural artifact, a symbol that can address us. We ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What new thought does this text “give rise to” in me, the human interpreter?</li>
  <li>Does an unexpected metaphor or a strange connection reveal a latent cultural logic embedded in its vast training data—a “textual unconscious” of our collective language?</li>
  <li>How does the AI’s response, even in its flaws, force me to clarify my own thinking and expand my own consciousness?</li>
</ul>

<p>This restorative reading is our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology">“teleology.”</a> It recognizes that meaning is not something contained <em>in</em> the AI but something created through our engagement with its output. The AI text, a product of a non-conscious, “archaic” process, becomes the occasion for a forward-looking, “teleological” expansion of our own understanding.</p>

<p>The true art of interpreting AI is to hold these two approaches in tension. We must be suspicious of the machine while remaining open to the meaning its strange new language can help us recollect. By embracing this conflict, we move beyond asking whether an AI can “mean” anything and begin the more fruitful work of discovering what can be meant <em>through</em> it.</p>
