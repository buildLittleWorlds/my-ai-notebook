  <h2>93 The Unparalyzed Skater: Answering the Apraxia Charge</h2>
  <p>In the <a href="/post-92">last post</a>, I framed the “skating along the surface” mindset as a modern form of Pyrrhonism. This immediately leads to an objection to the skeptical way of life: the charge of <em>apraxia</em> or the impossibility of action. Critics have argued for thousands of years that a life without belief is unlivable. Ancient anecdotes, likely hostile inventions, claimed Pyrrho would ignore oncoming wagons and precipices, needing his friends to keep him safe. If a skeptic truly suspends judgment on whether bread is more nourishing than a stone, how can they survive?</p>

<p>The Pyrrhonist response is sophisticated and reveals the practical core of their philosophy. It rests on a crucial distinction between dogmatic beliefs and appearances. The target of suspension of judgment (<em>epoché</em>) is specifically <em>doxa</em>: beliefs about non-evident matters or claims about the hidden, true nature of reality. A Pyrrhonist does not suspend judgment on <em>phainomena</em>, the appearances, or how things seem to them right now. As Sextus Empiricus explains, a skeptic grants that honey <em>appears</em> sweet but suspends judgment on whether it is sweet <em>in its essence</em>.</p>

<p>Based on this distinction, Sextus outlines a “fourfold rule of life” that allows the skeptic to navigate the world undogmatically (<em>adoxastos</em>) and avoid paralysis. The skater, as a modern Pyrrhonist, has a full toolkit for action:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Guidance of Nature:</strong> They are guided by their natural capacities for sensation and thought. An AI tool that appears to streamline a task is used; one that appears to complicate it is set aside.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Constraint of Passions:</strong> They are compelled by involuntary states like hunger and thirst. This extends to creative impulses. The desire to write or create is a pathos that drives them to seek the necessary tools without needing a dogmatic belief about the ultimate value of their project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tradition of Laws and Customs:</strong> The skeptic observes the established rules of their community. A skater can adhere to ethical guidelines and regulations concerning AI, not because they are believed to be objectively true, but because they are the apparent consensus on how to manage the technology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Instruction of the Arts:</strong> A skeptic can learn and practice a trade (<em>techné</em>) by following its established rules. A developer can use an AI coding assistant according to current best practices, observing its results without holding a firm belief about whether AI will ultimately enhance or destroy their profession.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This framework refutes the charge of apraxia. The skater isn’t paralyzed. They are guided by a set of non-dogmatic criteria: natural perception, internal drives, social convention, and practical training. This allows them to engage with AI practically while maintaining <em>epoché</em> on the irresolvable, dogmatic questions that cause so much anxiety. Skating the surface isn’t a cowardly retreat. It is a therapeutic practice for living rationally and peacefully in a world where the future will always be hidden (because it’s the future).</p>
