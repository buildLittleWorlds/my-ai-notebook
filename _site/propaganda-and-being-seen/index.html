  <h2>17 Propaganda and Being Seen</h2>
  <p>Here’s the paradox of propaganda. A tool for managing the masses can’t work if people feel like a faceless herd. So what does it do?</p>

<p>Ellul explains the trick. It has to make you feel like it’s talking just to you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…each one must feel individualized, each must have the impression that he is being looked at, that he is being addressed personally. Only then will he respond and cease to be anonymous (although in reality remaining anonymous).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Propaganda succeeds by giving us the feeling of uniqueness. It makes us feel seen. By satisfying our very real need to be an individual, it disarms us. We lower our defenses because it doesn’t feel like a lecture to a crowd, it feels like a conversation.</p>

<p>This is what keeps the “human spark” alive. It’s a managed flame, tended by a system that needs us to feel like individuals so that we will conform to its desires. This is what any perfectly personalized or customized thing is designed to do.</p>
