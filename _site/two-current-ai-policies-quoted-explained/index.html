  <h2>107 Two Current AI Policies (Quoted & Explained)</h2>
  <p>Universities everywhere are drafting rules for how students can and cannot use generative AI. Two representative policies look something like this:</p>

<h3 id="policy-statement-1-unauthorized-use-of-generative-ai">Policy Statement 1: Unauthorized Use of Generative AI</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to produce academic work without the explicit authorization of the course instructor is a violation of the university’s academic integrity policy. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Submitting AI-generated content (text, code, images, data, etc.) as your own original work.</li>
    <li>Using an AI tool to complete or substantially assist with assignments, exams, or projects when such assistance is unauthorized.</li>
    <li>Plagiarizing or paraphrasing content from an AI tool without proper citation, even if the source is not a human author.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Such unauthorized use is considered a form of cheating and/or plagiarism. Any violation will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include a failing grade on the assignment, a failing grade for the course, and other penalties in accordance with the university’s academic misconduct procedures.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="policy-statement-2-permitted-use-of-generative-ai-with-disclosure">Policy Statement 2: Permitted Use of Generative AI with Disclosure</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>In some courses, instructors may permit the use of generative AI tools for specific, limited purposes. When an instructor has given express permission, students may use these tools under the following conditions:</p>

  <p><strong>Instructor Approval:</strong> Use of generative AI is only permitted when the instructor has specified it as an acceptable tool in the course syllabus or on a particular assignment’s instructions.</p>

  <p><strong>Required Disclosure and Attribution:</strong> Students are required to disclose all instances of AI tool use. This disclosure must clearly describe how the tool was used and its contribution to the final work. Proper citation of the AI tool is mandatory, following the citation style specified by the instructor (e.g., MLA, APA).</p>

  <p>Examples of permitted uses may include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Using an AI tool for brainstorming, generating initial outlines, or refining research questions.</li>
    <li>Using an AI tool for grammar, spelling, or syntax checks.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It is the student’s responsibility to verify the accuracy and originality of all AI-generated content and to ensure the final submission adheres to all course requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-these-policies-expect">What These Policies Expect</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Instructor as gatekeeper:</strong> Students may only use AI if authorized by the instructor.</li>
  <li><strong>Mandatory disclosure:</strong> When permitted, students must report every instance and describe the tool’s contribution, with citation.</li>
  <li><strong>Equivalence to cheating (when unauthorized):</strong> Unauthorized AI use is grouped with plagiarism/cheating.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="a-simple-rejection">A Simple Rejection</h3>

<p>These policies treat writing methods as a public commodity subject to permission and surveillance. They collapse the difference between plagiarism (a harm to others) and method (an individual’s private intellectual process). I reject these as insufficiently robust when it comes to student freedom.</p>
