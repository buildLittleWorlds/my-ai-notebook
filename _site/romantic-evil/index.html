  <h2>9 Romantic Evil</h2>
  <p>What I’ve got here is what I’ll call my Romantic account of evil. It’s my own thoughts based on watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk2UetWsO-M&amp;t=2s">Isaiah Berlin’s lectures on Romanticism</a>. My goal is to clarify what a Romantic might think of as evil even if they wouldn’t use that word.</p>

<h3 id="romantic-evil">Romantic Evil</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Evil is any betrayal of vocation and sincerity. A refusal of the singular call that gives a life its shape. It is the willing exchange of destiny for comfort, of tragic seriousness for safety, of living speech for empty forms.</p>

<h3 id="marks-of-evil">Marks of Evil</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Inauthenticity:</strong> bad faith, selling out, self-betrayal; speaking words one does not inhabit.</li>
  <li><strong>Levelling:</strong> the flattening of irreducible difference into averages, norms, and interchangeable roles.</li>
  <li><strong>Profaned Communion:</strong> “togetherness” without persons. Kitsch intimacy that avoids risk and responsibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Cowardice:</strong> fear of the sublime risk where something worth dying for is at stake; preference for the tepid middle.</li>
  <li><strong>Instrumentalism:</strong> treating others (and language) as means, not as free centers that answer and demand answer.</li>
  <li><strong>Mechanical Repetition:</strong> the erosion of meaning by rote forms that no longer reveal an interior life.</li>
  <li><strong>The Anti‑Sublime:</strong> a world without tragedy because nothing ultimate is affirmed. No call, no pledge, no vow.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="moral-center">Moral Center</h3>
<p>Goodness is integrity. Commitment to one’s call; fidelity under risk; conversation that meets a person as a person; and a willingness to suffer the tragic costs of living in truth. The Romantic conscience prizes the singular, the vowed, and the answerable over comfort, utility, and faceless universals.</p>
