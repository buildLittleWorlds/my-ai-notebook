  <h2>98 The Citizen and the Nomad: Two Enemy Opt-Ins</h2>
  <p>The <a href="/post-97">last post</a> outlined Hegel’s demanding vision of a “deep opt-in,” a path that requires us to find our freedom through participation in the rational institutions of the state. Now we must return to the other form of opting-in this blog has explored, the one we found in Deleuze’s reading of Bartleby in <a href="/post-94">Post 94</a> and <a href="/post-96">Post 96</a>. Deleuze’s Bartleby also represents a “deep opt-in,” but it is an opting-in to a creative, nomadic life of escape, of becoming the “man without references” who makes possible a “society of brothers.” While both Hegel and Deleuze reject the Romantic’s principled withdrawal, their own programs for engagement are not allies. They are fundamentally irreconcilable, two enemy visions of the future.</p>

<p>The first point of conflict is the state. For Hegel, the rational state is the highest realization of human freedom, the concrete form of ethical life (Beiser, 2005). For Deleuze, the state is the ultimate apparatus of capture. It is the “paternal function” that Bartleby’s formula is designed to dismantle. Deleuze argues that the goal is to “liberate man from the father function… by constituting a society of brothers as a new universality” (Deleuze, 1997). The Hegelian citizen finds their identity within the state; the Deleuzian nomad finds it by escaping the state’s codifying logic.</p>

<p>This political opposition is rooted in a deeper philosophical one. Hegel’s dialectic is a logic of reconciliation; it works to resolve contradictions into a higher, more comprehensive unity (Beiser, 2005). Deleuze’s philosophy is the opposite: it is a machine for creating and affirming differences that <em>do not</em> resolve into a higher unity. His world, as he describes it, is not a unified continent but “an archipelago,” a “wall of loose, uncemented stones, where every element has a value in itself but also in relation to others” (Deleuze, 1997). Hegel seeks synthesis; Deleuze seeks connection without synthesis.</p>

<p>This leads to two completely different conceptions of freedom. Hegelian freedom belongs to the <strong>Citizen</strong>. It is the profound freedom of finding your proper place within a rational, organic whole and consciously willing its reality. Deleuzian freedom belongs to the <strong>Nomad</strong>. It is the freedom to create a “line of flight,” to desert your assigned place and invent new ways of life in the spaces between established structures.</p>

<p>And here we arrive at a surprising conclusion. In exploring the <a href="/post-63">“Three Roads Forward,”</a> it seemed that the most radical position was the “deep opt-out.” But we now see that another kind of irreconcilable conflict may be between two rival forms of the “deep opt-in.” Hegel’s project is to rationalize and perfect the system from within. Deleuze’s is to create new systems on the outside. One is a philosophy of the citizen, the other of the refugee. They are not allies in a shared project of engagement. They are enemy programs for how to live.</p>
