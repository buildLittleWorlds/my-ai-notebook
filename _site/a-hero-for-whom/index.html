  <h2>47 A hero for whom?</h2>
  <p>In my last two posts (<a href="/post-45">45</a>, <a href="/post-46">46</a>), I gave a Romantic reading of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg">“Hero”</a> music video. I said it champions a quiet, sincere heroism rooted in family and struggle. A modern update to the Carlylean “Great Man.” It’s a compelling story. But I think it’s wrong. Or at least oversimplifying. If you watch the video again, there’s stuff I smoothed over. The story’s not about a unified, authentic soul. The guy’s caught between competing narratives.</p>

<p>My earlier reading rested on this image: “The hero isn’t the man who conquers the bull for the crowd but the father who endures danger to provide for his child.” But that’s not the whole video. The cowboy doesn’t return to a welcoming home where he lives with his daughter. He pulls up in his truck to a separate house to pick her up for what looks like a visit. The mother stands in the doorway, holding another, younger child, watching him leave with their daughter.</p>

<p>The cowboy’s own place is a cramped, messy trailer. In one scene, there’s a woman (obviously not the daughter’s mom) sleeping in his bed. This shot breaks up the simple narrative of heroic sacrifice. He’s a cowboy and a father. And he’s a man living a transient life on the rodeo circuit, a life with another partner. His world is split. There’s the world of his past family, where he returns as a visitor, and the world of his present life (the rodeo, the road, and a new relationship).</p>

<p>This fracture requires re-reading things. Maybe the “let me go” line isn’t metaphorical. It’s not about being free from the pressures of being a public hero. It’s a literal thing. He’s talking to his daughter. Maybe his whole former family.  “I don’t want to be your hero” is him justifying his choices.</p>

<p>The heroic narrative of “providing for his child” doesn’t hold together. There are two things going on. There is some sacrifice. And there is sharing ice cream with his daughter. There’s also the other story. Him going back to his trailer and the life there without his daughter.</p>

<p>This is one thing modernist readings do. They’re impatient with simple, sentimental Romantics. With this reading, there’s no singular, authentic self here. For someone living after the Romantic, the video gets its power by not presenting a clear hero but showing the tension between the heroic story we want and the reality of messed-up lives. Maybe he is a hero in some ways or sometimes. But there’s no single thing called “being a hero” that holds the song together.</p>
