  <h2>74 The Author's Soul Made Manifest</h2>
  <p>The entire logic of “moral contamination” rests on a single (very resonant) idea: that an artwork is a direct conduit to its creator’s inner self. This wasn’t always the dominant view. For centuries, art was largely seen as a craft, a skillful imitation of external reality or an expression of universal truths. The Romantic movement performed a radical reversal, relocating the source of art from the outside world to the artist’s own soul. This was more than a change in taste; it was a profound philosophical project.</p>

<p>The key to this shift is the German concept of <a href="/romantic-kit-glossary"><em>Gefühl</em></a>. As I’ve started to explore in my project of <a href="/post-53">reconsidering the Romantics</a>, this term means far more than “feeling.” It was a strategic philosophical concept, elevated by thinkers like Schleiermacher to designate a fundamental, pre-reflective mode of awareness. <em>Gefühl</em> is not an emotion about a thing; it is the immediate, holistic consciousness of being itself. It was positioned as the ground from which all authentic thought, piety, and, crucially, artistic creation emerge.</p>

<p>This revaluation of feeling provided the philosophical license for a new theory of art: expressivism. The highest purpose of art was no longer to imitate nature, but to give form to this deep, singular, and authentic inner state. The artwork became the sensible evidence of the artist’s soul. As I argued in my reading of Whitman’s <a href="/post-25">“Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,”</a> the author becomes a presence who “pours his meaning into you.” This ideal of <a href="/romantic-kit-authenticity">authenticity</a>, the perfect, uncorrupted link between the inner vision and the outer work, became the new measure of artistic greatness.</p>

<p>This moral and intellectual perspective was not a discovery of a timeless truth about art; it was a intellectual process emerging from opposition to Enlightenment rationalism. By sacralizing the artist’s inner life, the Romantics created a new vocabulary for talking about art’s value. When we instinctively feel that a work by an unethical creator is “tainted,” we are speaking this language. We are assuming that the art is a direct relic of a flawed inner self, a manifestation of a corrupt <em>Gefühl</em>. This connection, first growing out into view two centuries ago, remains the primary justification for our modern impulse to turn away.</p>
