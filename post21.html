            <h2>21 Propaganda and the real problem</h2>
            <p>I watched a recent TEDx talk on AI and misinformation. The speaker, Aishwarya Reganti, laid out the standard fear. She's worried about a world "where the boundary between reality and deception is getting increasingly unclear." Her solution is for us, the consumers, to "take control and question what we consume."</p>
            <p>This is the decent, liberal, common sense position. And Jacques Ellul would say it is a catastrophe. It completely misunderstands the nature of modern propaganda.</p>
            
            <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
                <p>Modern man needs a relation to facts, a self-justification to convince himself that by acting in a certain way he is obeying reason and proved experience.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Ellul argues that we don't want to be lied to. We crave facts. We need information to feel rational. The speaker's proposed solution (better detection tools, watermarking, more careful individual analysis) is a project to create a "better" set of facts. But this only strengthens the propaganda system.</p>
            <p>The speaker in the talk says, "We are so caught up in how this content speaks to us that whether or not it's true becomes secondary." She sees this as a weakness. Ellul would see it as the primary mechanism. The call for us to become better fact checkers is an impossible demand.</p>

            <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
                <p>His opinion will ultimately be formed solely on the basis of the facts transmitted to him, and not on the basis of his choice and his personal experience.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This is the core of it. By focusing on cleaning up the "facts" provided by AI, we are just asking for a more perfect, more seamless, and more total information environment. An environment that feels true, that is certified as "not misinformation." This doesn't arm us against propaganda. It makes the propaganda invisible. The problem isn't the fake image of the Pentagon on fire. The problem is our absolute dependence on a constant stream of images and facts to tell us what is real.</p>
