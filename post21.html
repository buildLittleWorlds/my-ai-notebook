            <h2>21 The romantic ghost</h2>
            <p>The "AI is fascist" thing doesn't work. Maybe it used to. But it's recycled material now.</p>
            <p>I worked out my own definition of <a href="post9.html">what I called "Romantic Evil."</a> I was trying to pin down what animates one kind of opposition to AI. The marks of it looked something like this:</p>

            <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
                <p><strong>Inauthenticity:</strong> bad faith, selling out, self-betrayal; speaking words one does not inhabit.<br>
                <strong>Profaned Communion:</strong> “togetherness” without persons. Kitsch intimacy that avoids risk and responsibility.<br>
                <strong>Instrumentalism:</strong> treating others (and language) as means, not as free centers that answer and demand answer.<br>
                <strong>Mechanical Repetition:</strong> the erosion of meaning by rote forms that no longer reveal an interior life.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This is obviously the same vocabulary used to attack AI. The whole argument is that AI art is evil because it's <em>inauthentic</em> (made by a machine, not a person), <em>instrumental</em> (a tool for power and profit), and results in a <em>profaned communion</em> (art without a soul).</p>
            <p>I already <a href="post13.html">summed this up before</a>. The anxieties about AI as fascist are the same old romantic anxieties. The problem isn't that the feelings aren't real. The problem is the diagnosis is a hundred years out of date. Or two hundred years.</p>
            <p>We're trying to understand a new kind of machine with a pre-industrial vocabulary.</p>
