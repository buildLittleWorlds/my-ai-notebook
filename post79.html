            <h2>79 The Case for a Secular Boycott</h2>

            <p>Let's consider the possibility that this entire description of an intellectual lineage, from Schleiermacher's hermeneutics to Schiller's beautiful soul, is an elegant but ultimately irrelevant historical detour. Here's the counter-narrative. It's an objection positing that the modern boycott has little to do with an unacknowledged <a href="post73.html">Romantic inheritance</a> and is instead a product of distinctly modern, secular, and materialist concerns.</p>

            <p>From this perspective, analyzing the boycott for traces of <em>Gef√ºhl</em> is just over-reading. The modern consumer is not a frustrated Romantic wrestling with their soul's purity. They are a pragmatic actor operating in a complex global marketplace. This counter-narrative rests on three pillars:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Conscious Consumerism:</strong> The most direct explanation is economic. People boycott because they do not want their money to financially support individuals or corporations whose actions they find reprehensible. This isn't an ethics of inner purity; it's an ethics of material impact. It's the same logic that drives boycotts of companies that use sweatshop labor or damage the environment. It is a practical, consequentialist action rooted in a clear understanding of economic complicity.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Signaling and Solidarity:</strong> The act of boycotting is rarely a private one; it is a public and social statement. Its power lies in collective action and social signaling. Refusing to engage with an artist's work is an act of solidarity with victims and a method of stripping "cultural capital" from the unethical creator. This is a sociological act, not a spiritual one, aimed at influencing public norms and participating in a wider social justice conversation.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Literacy:</strong> The modern, media-literate audience is keenly aware that art is a product. They understand the immense collaborative and industrial machinery behind a blockbuster film or a pop album. The idea that they are engaging in a mystical <a href="post78.html">communion with the creator's soul</a> is, for this audience, a naive fiction.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This pragmatic view represents a competing intellectual tradition, one with its own historical roots in Enlightenment consequentialism and 20th-century sociology. It sees the world in terms of systems, power, and economic flows. It's basically the analysis I looked at earlier of <a href="post10.html">evil as systemic harm</a>. It argues that we should analyze the boycott on these terms, not by projecting the esoteric concerns of 19th-century German philosophers onto the modern public.</p>
