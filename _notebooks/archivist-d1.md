**Catalog Code:** D1

## Provenance

Five woodcuts attributed to *Castelia*, acquired from Capital alley dealers (Lot 41–45).
Dealer bills claim "Yeller Quarry Hunt" origin; two impressions bear alley-stamp ink, one has a
partial chapel watermark. Comparison set includes three postcard-scale copies and one painted
facsimile on tin. Lot intake photographed and dusted; edges measured against known Castelia blocks.

## Extract — Trade & Image

> "The fivefold figure in silhouette… the famous Yeller Quarry Hunt depiction by Castelia."
> Trinket images sold in Capital alleys as patron-saint mementos; more sightings claimed in Dead River,
> fewer in the Capital; almost none who claim to have truly seen her.

## Findings — Block & Copy

- **Block-line:** Two cuts share a burr consistent with Castelia's late period; three do not.
- **Ink & stock:** Alley-ink mix on all; chapel watermark likely a pasted backing.
- **Pose-variance:** Silhouettes differ at wrists and jawline; "fivefold" reads as seam, not count.
- **Copy-chain:** Postcard set copies the burr but loses the wrist flare; tin facsimile invents both.

## Archivist's Commentary

The market wants a single cut—an origin to worship. The slips refuse it. Even where the burr
repeats, the wrists don't; even where the jaw aligns, the paper lies. We file the images as a
chase that throws its own doubles: a line of impressions that will not resolve to first or fifth.
As for the sightings, we keep the trinkets with the testimonies. Both are silhouette-work: light
around a body the ledgers cannot catch.
