> 
> || Senate stairs: rise shallow, tread narrow; designed to slow crowds while favoring licensed knees. ||

## Archivist's Commentary

The Capital makes architecture do the filing. The aperture governs what may cross (paper, not flesh);
the stairwell governs how fast. We shelve this under *Mediation & Aperture*: the city's truth is
throttled by its openings. The "minor" voice is not a confession but a measurement of pressure at the rim.
