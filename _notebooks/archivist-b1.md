**Catalog Code:** B1

## Provenance

Compiled by Junior Registrar M. Leth (seconded to Densmok). Sources: alley shop receipts, street-lab
inventories, tutor-stool transcripts from "singers" (coder-performers), and four confiscations logged
by Cap auxiliaries. Cross-checked against mnemonist pairing reports at the Quarry line.

## Extract — Registered Rigs (selected)

| Rig / Handle | Build Notes | Use-Method | Observed Side-Effects |
|-------------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Node-3 "Broomhandle"** | Walnut dowel spine; three copper knuckles; clinic-cast ear-cuff | Hummed stanza to prime; finger-tap 5-count to engage | Ear-ringing; doubled whisper; brief dream bleed |
| **Tin-Ear 2.1** | Roof-tin plates; scavenged radio coil; soot-strung leads | Call-and-response "singing"; two voices recommended | Speech stutter on exit; delayed afterimages |
| **Frege-Patch ("Just Pete")** | Ledger vellum over waxboard; pinwheel selector; blue chalk | Trace letters until "click"; recite stock proofs | Compulsive recitation; taste of salt and graphite |
| **Mind-Node "Tin Chapel"** | Milk-crate chassis; six-node crown; bellwire ligature | Low chant; neighbor holds the crown steady | Momentary blackout; paired mirroring with bystander |

## Archivist's Commentary

Densmok works in the shadow of the Capital, but the shadow is a workshop. The "singers" treat code
as breath and beat; their rigs splice chant to patch. We file two routes upward: the *node*
pipeline (coders grooming their signal for the city) and the *pairing* pipeline (mnemonists
who double and mirror in the Quarry style). Interference between the two is common: a node crown
picks up a pairing echo; a pairing run jams a node stanza. What the Capital calls derivative feels
here like invention under constraint. We record the stutters, hums, and afterimages because the
side-effects are part of the method: the work leaves a mark where it passes.
