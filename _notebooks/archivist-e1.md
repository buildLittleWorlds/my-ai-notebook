**Catalog Code:** E1

## Provenance

Lane-collector spools from the North road (wax & aluminum, mixed quality); stool-transcripts from taverns
between Gee Road and the Quarry line; two parish songbooks (loose-leaf, weather damage). Compiled by the
North Desk, with cross-notes to the Northo "Lives" folio and three depositions referencing the mapmaker's cart.

## Extract

> "Singers show up, come from North Town more than any other borough. Why? Murder songs."
> 
> "The principle of North Town is living a secret life — serial killer only being one of the more obvious variety."

## Index — First Lines & Recording Notes

| *Mother sewed my shadow shut* | North gate steps | parish notebook | Margin hand: "*missionary is the killer*" (ink-blot, uncertain hand) |

## Archivist's Commentary

The singers carry two ledgers at once: melody for the square, confession for the alley. Many of the
North songs turn on a small instrument—knife, creek, borrowed name—then open a second life under the first,
where the "missionary" voice courts and conceals. Our task is not to decide who kills, only to preserve
the split. We file doubled takes beside clean ones, and keep the hums, because the hum is how the road
remembers who passed over it.
