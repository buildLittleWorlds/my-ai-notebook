**Catalog Code:** H1

## Provenance

Tutor's notebook recovered from a Tower-adjacent instruction room; marginalia by a parent-scribe.
Supplementary pages from a catechetical handout filed under "Repetition & Fit." Copied twice
by Capital junior clerks; Tower origin unconfirmed.

## Extract

> "Edges to edges," said at each misfit; the child turns the piece. 
> Repetition of language creates the experience of fit—and the possibility of communication.

## Lesson Record — Unit 3: Fitting

- **Drill:** identify edges; rotate non-edges; retry without prompt
- **Chorus:** class repeats rule before each attempt ("edges to edges")
- **Observation:** self-prompt emerges in child after 7–9 repetitions
- **Transfer:** rule applied to a different picture (pond → cabin)

## Archivist's Commentary

A rule repeated until it turns itself: the Tower's way is to make speech lay the track for the hand.
The child's voice carries the fit forward; the picture follows later. We file this with confession
manuals and rehab scripts not to collapse them but to keep their cadence together: repetition that
builds a world of correct joins, taught at the table one corner at a time.
