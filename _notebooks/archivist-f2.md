## Provenance

Compiled from *Dead River* school folios ("5000s" set), Capeast sandbox memos referencing
Ria Levins's early work, and alley-shop ephemera linking Yeller silhouettes to Dead River routes.

## Extract

> || "One possibility is to make 5000s the only place where Ria's Dead River work and the Capeast School overlap…
> Maybe it's early work by Ria playing in the Densworld sandbox before doing her own thing." ||
> 
> || "You will have heard of Yeller… the fivefold figure in silhouette… how can a single fivefold being—
> five women-one being—maintain itself over generations?… Though what you might ask is whether the man in the
> pickbox cart might be himself some kind of immortal…" ||

## Archivist's Commentary

The overlap is not a merger but a pressure point: Capeast pedagogy brushes the Dead River mythos and
leaves a seam that later readers misname as origin. The fivefold Yeller and the pickbox man turn the
question of "continuity" inside out—are we tracking persons, or patterns? For the 5000s we file the overlap
as a rehearsal space where an artist's method (Levins) tests the market's silhouettes (Yeller) and the cart's
interior world (pickbox) without resolving who lasts. The dossier keeps the seam visible so later datings
don't harden into firsts.
