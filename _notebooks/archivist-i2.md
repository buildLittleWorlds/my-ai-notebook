**Catalog Code:** I2

## Provenance

Tower · Instructor lesson logs (Y18–Y21) and "anomalies register" slips from the Mirado schoolroom;
compiled after puzzle-catechism sessions ("edges to edges") with follow-up speech observations.

## Extract

> **Slip 4:** After nine repetitions of the puzzle rule, subject self-prompts correctly.
> In free talk, says: "Blue is baby," then clarifies by pointing to the mother's apron (blue gingham).
> Later in the week: "Apple means mother," used whenever lunch bell sounds. Instructor notes *register-shift*:
> rule language migrates into kinship talk.
> 
> **Slip 7:** Subject whispers "edges to edges" while aligning cutlery; when corrected to
> "spoons and spoons," replies: "Edges are for babies." Teacher remarks: *connotation drift*—the procedural
> phrase accrues age-value, then social value, without explicit instruction.
> 
> **Slip 11:** During picture transfer (pond → cabin), subject names the frame "home"
> and refuses "house," insisting: "Home is when the blue is on." (Apron absent that day.)

## Archivist's Commentary

The Tower's drill makes speech lay the track for the hand—but the child's speech keeps laying tracks of its own.
A procedural rule ("edges to edges") begets a private lexicon where colors pick up kinship, and steps on a puzzle
board appear as steps toward a person. We file this under *Silence & Withdrawal* to keep it beside
the catechism notes: repetition builds fit; fit spills into meaning.
