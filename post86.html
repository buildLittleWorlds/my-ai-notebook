            <h2>86 An Unresolved Inheritance</h2>

            <p>This series has traced a long and complex intellectual lineage, from the Romantics' creation of a new ethics of authenticity to Hegel's critique of its internal contradictions. We arrive now at a synthesis, not of a final answer, but of a clearer understanding of our present condition. The modern debate over boycotts is the stage where two competing historical frameworks for ethical life collide.</p>

            <p>The series began by reconstructing the <a href="post73.html">Romantic inheritance</a>: an ethical and aesthetic worldview based on the sacredness of the individual soul. We saw how this produced a demand for <a href="post74.html">artistic authenticity</a>, an ethics of <a href="post76.html">purity and withdrawal</a>, and a model of reading as <a href="post78.html">intimate communion</a>. All of this, I argued, provides the deep (and mostly unconscious) logic for the modern boycotter's profound sense of moral urgency and personal contamination.</p>

            <p>Next I looked at the counter-narrative, which dismisses this history in favor of a secular analysis of <a href="post79.html">economics and social signaling</a>. Then this counter-narrative was (again) challenged by a Romantic model I just don't think has ever quit. The Romantic reasserts itself in the logic of the <a href="post81.html">"poisoned seed"</a> and the defiance of the <a href="post82.html">"moral semaphore."</a></p>

            <p>Hegel's critique shows the instability at the heart of the Romantic project. His diagnosis of the <a href="post83.html">"beautiful soul"</a> as a consciousness engaged in a "pathology of inaction," which devolves into the hypocrisy of the <a href="post84.html">"hard heart,"</a> makes for a very damaging analysis of an ethics based on pure interiority. Hege's proposed perspective is a turn to the shared, concrete world of <a href="post85.html"><em>Sittlichkeit</em></a> or the "ethical life."</p>

            <p>This leaves us with tension. We are heirs to both traditions. The Schillerian desire for a "clean conscience" and a life of inner harmony is still a normal human aspiration. It's the engine of our personal moral convictions. But the Hegelian demand for engagement in an ambiguous and shared world is a requirement for any meaningful social or political life. The modern boycott is the expression of this conflict. It is an attempt to achieve Schillerian purity within a Hegelian world of complex interdependence.</p>
            
            <p>As I sketched out in <a href="post63.html">"Three Roads Forward,"</a> this dilemma forces a choice. The path of the beautiful soul leads toward a deep opt-out. The pragmatic view encourages us to skate along the surface. The Hegelian analysis tries to find a deep opt-in.</p>
