**Catalog Code:** H3

## Provenance

Tower of Mirado · Family trip notes surrounding the Lincoln Memorial Garden dedication; phone-call fragments about a prepared speech; later family retellings that preserve a Jensen line as doctrine (Springfield, IL; Meg/Josh/Esther/Harriet chain).

## Extract

> || Mom was saying words at the dedication. ||

> || She’d sent ten or more copies of her three minute speech to Meg and called her so much about it that whenever her phone rang Josh had started whispering in the background, a bit too loudly to be safe, “Four score and fourteen years ago, my mother, my dear daughter’s grandmother, Harriet Knudson, brought forth, with the help of – God bless him – the most famous landscaper nobody’s heard of, a garden in Springfield. A garden for Mr. Lincoln. A garden...” ||

> || So, instead of watching the time or leaning on the speedometer, she let the radio think for her and arrived at the garden with five minutes to spare. ||

> || Meg had fallen for Josh because he’d known the difference between redbuds and dogwoods. ||

> || …convincing world famous landscape architect Jens Jensen to drive down from Chicago and design what he later called “the only garden to truly embody my deepest principles,” ||


## Archivist’s Commentary

The day installs a method. A public **program** (copies of a three-minute speech; “Mom was saying words at the dedication”) is present in the ledgers, but the content itself does not survive in this packet. The record leaves a bracketed interval where the ceremony should be; what remains in force are the **habits** the day affirms: arriving to a tempo (“let the radio think”), then walking and naming—**redbuds / dogwoods**—until the garden’s rule lives in the hand (and eye). In the Tower, we file this under **Silence & Withdrawal**: speech **lays the track** and then **withdraws**, leaving practice to carry it forward . The Jensen sentence persists not as oratory but as doctrine—an articulated principle that the paths remember.

Cross-index (light): **Boundary**—a garden as a managed edge between design and wild; keep the tension rather than resolve it (see Tower drills where a line both bounds and moves) .
