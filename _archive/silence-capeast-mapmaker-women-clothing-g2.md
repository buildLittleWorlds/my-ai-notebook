## Provenance

Pattern log compiled after the Harvest Festival (Capeast Ward notes, Alley Watch intake);
appended parish protests and market-stall testimonies from the same night.

## Extract

> || "It was a festival night… the night after the festival of harvest… The mapmaker's women arrived ahead of the mapmaker." ||
> 
> || "The mapmaker's women were clothed in a pattern that shifted each time they were seen…
> covering up one breast on one of the women and leaving the other bare and covering both on all the others
> but leaving a core circle on those four women bare on their backs. This brought curiosity and protest
> wherever the mapmaker journeyed." ||

## Archivist's Commentary

Capeast files spectacle as ordinance: the same step becomes a citation when cloth turns hinge.
The pattern log shows variety by design—self-chosen fittings—yet the protests read choice as threat,
converting arrival into a paperwork queue. We keep both ledgers: the shifting variants (agency in dress)
and the complaints (agency misread as offense). The women precede their story; the records lag behind,
trying to catch a moving seam with stationary rules.
