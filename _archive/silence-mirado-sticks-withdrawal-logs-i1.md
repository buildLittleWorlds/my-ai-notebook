**Catalog Code:** I1

## Provenance

Sticks clinic intake cards; two "return-to-body" journals; roadside interviews with art students;
one Tower memo on Sticks non-compliance ("silence escalation"). Collected on the downstate routes.

## Extract

> A place like America not too long ago… but also a thousand years in the future. 
> Stasis since about 1990; a small group in the Tower lives by turning the world into raw material
> for their virtual lives. In the Sticks people disengage from screens and reenter the physical world.

## Archivist's Commentary

In the Sticks, truth is something you stop saying to see if it stays. Many returns begin with a
broken screen and end in hand-work: puzzles, drawing, walking a loop until the body remembers its
turn radius. We file the silence as a method, not a void. The Tower names this non-compliance; we
keep it as a local grammar where words go last and hands go first.
