# Archive Collection — Section Guide

## Purpose & Role in Site Structure

**The Archive** contains **fictional primary documents** from Densworld (in-character). These are the actual slips, testimonies, and fragments that Densworld archivists collect, file, and study. This is pure creative fiction presented as archival scholarship.

### Position in Site Ecosystem:
1. **Blog Posts** (real-world essays, out-of-character)
2. **Romantic Quick Kit** (real theory, out-of-character)  
3. **AI Hermeneutics Kit** (real theory, out-of-character)
4. **The Archive** ← *You are here* (fictional Densworld documents, in-character)
5. **The Debate** (fictional Densworld meta-discussion, in-character)

### Relationship to Debate Collection:
- **The Archive** = Primary documents being filed and studied
- **The Debate** = Institutional discussions about how to organize these documents
- Both are part of the same fictional world, but serve different narrative functions

## Archival System Structure

### The Six Orders (Primary Classification):
Documents are filed by **what reality they perform**, not geographic origin:

1. **Boundary** — Where edges blur between categories (town/wilderness, forms)
2. **Doubling** — Replication, copies, journeys within journeys, originals without origin  
3. **Craving** — Desire as generative force, drives, appetites, proliferations
4. **Silence & Withdrawal** — Where speech collapses, truth through quiet practice
5. **Violence & Secret Life** — Parallel ledgers of harm and hidden motives
6. **Mediation & Aperture** — Windows, devices, how world is constrained by perception

### Geographic Regions (Secondary Classification):
- **Capital** — Bureaucratic center, licensing, formal procedures
- **Dens/Densmok** — Edge settlements, wilderness boundaries  
- **Quarry** — Source of materials, journeys, multiplicities
- **North Town/Northo** — Murder songs, secret lives, doubled identities
- **Tower/Sticks** — Withdrawal practices, catechisms, clinic work
- **Dead River** — Counting systems, numerical mysteries
- **Capeast** — Festival sites, women's arrival stories

## Writing Voice & Style

- **Archival voice**: Professional, analytical, preserving ambiguity
- **In-character**: Written by fictional Densworld archivists
- **Fragmentary**: Documents are incomplete, mysterious, evocative
- **Interpretive**: Archivist commentary explains filing decisions

## Content Guidelines & Entry Format

### Required Structure:
```yaml
---
title: "Archive Post [CODE] — [REGION]: [TITLE] ([DOCUMENT TYPE])"
order: "[ONE OF SIX ORDERS]"
region: "[GEOGRAPHIC REGION]"
catalog_code: "[ALPHANUMERIC CODE]"
excerpt: "[KEY QUOTE FROM COMMENTARY]"
---

**Catalog Code:** [CODE]

## Provenance
[Source information, how document was acquired]

## Extract
[Quoted material from original documents, often in blockquotes]

## Archivist's Commentary
[Interpretive analysis of why this fits the assigned Order]
```

### File Naming Convention:
```
[order]-[region]-[descriptive-slug]-[code].md
```
Example: `boundary-dens-sludge-meter-readings-c1.md`

### What Belongs Here:
- Fictional primary source documents from Densworld
- Fragmented testimonies, field reports, measurements, observations
- Mysterious documents requiring interpretive analysis
- Materials that demonstrate the six Orders through content
- Archival commentary explaining filing decisions

### What Does NOT Belong Here:
- Real-world theory or analysis (those go in theory collections)
- Meta-discussions about archival practice (those go in `_debate/`)
- Out-of-character reflection (those go in `_posts/`)

## Technical Specifications

### Required Front Matter:
```yaml
---
title: "Archive Post [CODE] — [REGION]: [TITLE] ([TYPE])"
order: "[Order Name]"
region: "[Region Name]"
catalog_code: "[Code]"
excerpt: "[Quote]"
layout: archive
---
```

### Navigation:
- Accessible from homepage tile "Archive"
- Listed on `/archive/` hub page (auto-generated by Order)
- Individual URLs: `/archive/:name/`
- Hub includes link to related `/debate/archivists-debate/`

### Cross-Reference Linking:
Use Jekyll's relative_url filter for internal links:
```markdown
[link text]({{ '/archive/filename/' | relative_url }})
```

## Fictional World Consistency

### Core Premise:
Densworld archivists have developed a revolutionary filing system based on **interpretive categories** (Orders) rather than **geographic categories** (regions). This creates ongoing institutional tension documented in the Debate collection.

### Narrative Coherence:
- Each entry must authentically represent its assigned Order through content
- Regional details should be consistent across entries
- Archivist commentary should reflect institutional voice and methodology
- Documents should feel genuinely fragmentary and mysterious

### Integration with Debate Collection:
The Archive provides the **primary materials** that the Debate documents discuss organizing. Debate references should align with actual Archive contents.

## Current Status

- **18+ entries** representing all six Orders across multiple regions
- **Consistent archival methodology** with systematic filing rationale
- **Rich fictional world** with geographic and institutional coherence
- **Evocative fragments** that reward careful reading and interpretation

This collection serves as the creative heart of the site's fictional world—a rigorous but mysterious archive that demonstrates interpretive principles through narrative rather than exposition.
