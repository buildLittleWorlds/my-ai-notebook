**Catalog Code:** A3

## Provenance

Roadside and tavern testimonies from the **North Town/Northo** line; axle-repair ledger notes; North murder-song index; Dead River detour account (nested lids); contextual notes from the Archive’s traveling-device appendix. Cross-filed to prior slip **E2** (“Northo: The Mapmaker’s Pickbox”) and to Debate **Case Note 19.4** (“On the Pickbox Cart and Authorless Burden”).

## Extract

> || *The mapmaker stopped at a village once… a cart that seemed tiny, almost no larger than a wheelbarrow, but which opened up inside into a house or even a town. And they had heard of the five women who walked behind the cart, roped to the cart and walking as one woman though they were five.* ||&#x20;

> || *A man arrived with a cart not quite larger than a wheelbarrow yet opening inside into rooms upon rooms. Five women walked behind it as if roped though they were not… No one could agree on what made the cart so heavy, only that the man refused others’ food and the women refused his.* ||&#x20;

> || *We lifted the lid. Inside was a second cart, smaller. Inside that, another. At the fifth, we stopped. The lids did not close again.* ||&#x20;

> || *The cart rolled without him. It killed two girls. The song says: “pick, pick, pick,” but no name sings with it.* ||&#x20;

> || *The pickbox cart is a region unto itself—Gunnr-wood, bone, leather, corners beyond corners… Its operator listens for a count—specifically five—in a girl’s tapping; counting recruits; the burden encloses its own geography. In North Town, a murder song reports the cart rolling without him.* ||&#x20;

> || *…the fivefold figure in silhouette… how can a single fivefold being—five women-one being—maintain itself over generations? … Though what you might ask is whether the man in the pickbox cart might be himself some kind of immortal…* ||&#x20;

## Archivist’s Commentary

We file the **Pickbox** under **Mediation & Aperture** because each testimony treats the cart not as an object but as an **opening**: a burden that **permits contents** (rooms, tools, routes) while denying the body any clean authorship. The Northo witness reaches for measurement and fails—“not quite larger than a wheelbarrow,” then the sentence falls **inside** the box and returns as rooms and weight. The ledger wants a maker; the songs return only a **method** (“pick, pick, pick”). Where speech asks for a name, the cart **answers with a form**.&#x20;

Three recurrent seams warrant the drawer:

1. **Aperture before place.** As with the Capital’s windows and the map that makes Dead River, the cart **installs** a geography rather than inhabits one. The moment witnesses try to close the lid on provenance (“Northo cart”), the lid opens to **another cart**, and then another, until counting (five) becomes the only stable rule left. We have geography by device, not device by geography.&#x20;

2. **Authorless burden.** The song that reports “the cart rolled without him” strips the file of its last custodian. We are not filing a man’s possession; we are filing an **operation** that persists without a confessor. In this respect the cart rhymes with the Archive’s own frustration: devices travel; names do not hold.&#x20;

3. **Counting as gate.** Several records yoke the cart’s behavior to **five**—the number that already organizes Yeller’s figure and Dead River’s maintenance stories. The cart’s operator “listens for a count” to recruit; the detour book stops at the fifth lid; the songs in North keep five alive as menace and meter. In our schema that’s the pressure where **Doubling** (recurrence without origin) crosses the aperture, but the primary work remains **mediation**: a count that **admits**. &#x20;

4. **Silence, refusal, watch.** The women’s refusals (of food, of commentary) and their practiced **watch** place them on the threshold between **agency** and **ordinance**. Their step is “as one though they were five,” which the parish world reads as offense against clothing or decorum elsewhere; here, the offense is against provenance. They arrive **before** the story that can house them. We mark their watching as a form of custodianship the cart itself requires: a **quiet** that keeps the aperture from collapsing into a person.&#x20;

**Filing decision.**
Primary **Order:** *Mediation & Aperture*. Region tagged **Northo** (first stable witness) with cross-notes to **North Town** (murder-song behavior) and **Dead River** (nested lids). We preserve counts (“five”), refusals, and the absence of author as evidence, not defects.

**Methodological note.**
To insist on a single geography is to force the lid shut. In these slips the lid **will not close**. We recommend device-first shelving across the family of cart cases; where **Region** is demanded by policy, retain it as **provenance** and maintain cross-refs by **Order**.
