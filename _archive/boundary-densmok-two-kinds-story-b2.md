**Catalog Code:** B2

## Provenance

Compiled from west-edge Densmok stool transcripts and lane interviews; cross-checked with
ditch-readers' ledgers and three roadside sermons recovered from the north spur into Dens.

## Extract

> There are two kinds of story you'll hear about Dens.
> In one: a regular town—dirty, small, out on the edge.
> In the other: the wilderness itself is alive, thickening by the day, pushing up against houses
> until streets and buildings are only the faintest rises under the grit. In either telling, the name
> *Dens* belongs as much to the wilderness as to the town—and some say the two are already the same.

## Archivist's Commentary

The accounts refuse to stay separate. "Town" and "wilderness" read like two halves of a circle
our witnesses keep turning through: settlement becoming exile, exile folding back into a harder
settlement. We have no single "before" and "after" here, only a loop of approaches where each
version makes the other legible. Readers who want a stable Dens must accept a moving boundary:
every whole appears only through its parts—and the parts keep drifting.
