**Catalog Code:** E2

## Provenance

Axle repair entry from the village ledger (night watch signature smudged); tavern-boy's notes
recorded by the reeve; corroborating remarks from two men who shadowed the road toward Gee.

## Extract

> A man arrived with a cart not quite larger than a wheelbarrow yet opening inside into rooms upon rooms.
> Five women walked behind it as if roped though they were not. He slept a day and a night while they
> watched him. At dawn, with the new axle fitted, he pulled west again. No one could agree on what made
> the cart so heavy, only that the man refused others' food and the women refused his.

## Archivist's Commentary

The witnesses look for a single hand to carry the weight: the man, the women, the objects. The cart
answers by moving anyway. It drags its own world forward and speaks only in what it unfolds—rooms,
habits, distances—never in confession. We file intention last here. The burden is its own author;
the testimony is the only map we can draw.
