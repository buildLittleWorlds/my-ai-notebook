**Catalog Code:** F1

## Provenance

Collated from alley reports in Miasto (Quarry capital), two road-watch logs outside the gates,
and a series of northern depositions from Gunnr villages regarding a man with a pickbox cart.
Supplemented by trinket-trade notes on the fivefold hunt silhouette, filed for iconographic cross-check.

## Extract

> "He looked for girls… He watched for a counting tap… There was a number he was after. Five."
> 
> "Miasto… the man was a northerner… His pickbox cart waited outside… its hollows ready…"
> 
> "You will have heard of Yeller… the fivefold figure in silhouette…"

## Archivist's Commentary

The number draws the watcher as much as the watcher draws the number. Five appears first as a child's
tap and ends as a silhouette for sale. Between those two ledgers—the road and the market—walks the cart
that opens inward. We record the misses alongside the sightings because absence also leaves a trail:
the odor on a road, the hush at a shrine, the family that packs by dawn. There is no arrest here, only
a pattern tightening. We keep the pattern for when someone asks who began it.
