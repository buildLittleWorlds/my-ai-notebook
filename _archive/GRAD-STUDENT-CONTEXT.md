# GRAD-STUDENT-CONTEXT — The Archive and the World of Dens

> This is your **one-stop primer** to Densworld and to the Capital Archive that files it. You are not expected to read the ore files or every slip. Read this, skim the cross-links you need, then start drafting your first **in-character** archive slip. At you top, you fill find broad overviews of the regions of Densworld; following will be more focused context about the Archive within Densworld.

## Historian’s Overview of Densworld — A World of Orders, Regions, and Traveling Devices

Densworld is not only a geography; it’s a set of repeatable pressures that organize lives. The Archive models those pressures as **Orders**—Boundary; Doubling; Craving; Silence & Withdrawal; Violence & Secret Life; Mediation & Aperture—and it treats **Regions** as secondary (provenance rather than destiny). Read this as a historian’s long view: how the regions fit together, what devices bind them, and why the same motifs—maps, windows, carts, fives—keep surfacing wherever you look.

### The Capital (and Capeast): Architecture as Method, Bureaucracy as Aperture

The Capital is the center that throttles access. Its emblem is a **round window**—no door, just a circular aperture for slips, receipts, ledgers—calipered to tolerances and re-lacquered on schedule. Even the Senate stairs are built to slow bodies while privileging licensed knees. Capital’s doctrine is plain: **knowledge may pass; bodies may not**—architecture performs the Order of **Mediation & Aperture**.

Capeast is the Capital’s “after”—after work, after festival—where arrivals become paperwork. When the **mapmaker’s women** enter a harvest-night square, complaints begin with **cloth** (shoulders, bare rings on backs) before agency; the city files spectacle as ordinance. The women sometimes arrive **before** the mapmaker; their step is coordinated, their fittings intentionally varied—evidence that story lags practice. Capeast thus magnifies Capital’s logic: governing by **aperture** and **notice**, catching moving seams with stationary rules.

### Dens / Densmok: An Edge That Won’t Hold, and a Workshop in the Shadow

Dens is a town that is also a wilderness. Witnesses and ditch meters contradict each other: some say the grit is swallowing the town; others that the town has swollen, pushing the wild back. The Archive’s field logs learned to keep both and name the phenomenon **Boundary**—the **edge itself** is the content. In Dens, geography is an **act** (edge-shift), not a map coordinate.

Densmok, the industrial spill of Dens, turns constraint into invention. **Singers** here treat **code as breath and beat**, building rigs that splice chant to hardware; two upward “pipelines” develop—a node pipeline and a **pairing** pipeline—and they interfere with each other like crossed radio. The world’s famous “plot machine” also clicks on a Densmok night shift: “Two people with eyes closed… **A plot is the intersection of their stares**,” a device-rule that lets truth pass while bodies stay put—exactly Capital’s window logic, now rendered in software. Dens/Densmok together teach the Archive that an **edge** can be measured, and that a **form** can constrain truth: Boundary and Mediation, side by side.

---

### Yeller Quarry: Roads That Bud, Copies Without Origin, and the Respectable Commute

The Quarry’s proverb says: “Every true journey begins in the Quarry… **midway a second road buds off inside the first**… **Each path throws another**.” Maps cannot agree which line is original; what looks like the main road is already a seam. The Archive calls this **Doubling**—**proliferation without origin**.

The same pattern holds in the **Hunt** woodcuts attributed to Castelia. Five silhouettes share and refuse each other—burrs repeat while **wrists** and **jaws** won’t align—and the postcard/tin copies invent details the “originals” don’t have. Markets crave a first cut; the slips refuse it.

Socially, the Quarry is the **respectable commute into appetite**: “rich folk” sneak from Capital/Mirado to **eat off greasy tables and get off on greasy thighs**, then launder themselves on the return. Public ledger and private ledger do not meet; the Archive files the split under **Violence & Secret Life** with a cross-pull to **Craving**. Quarry routes, images, and appetites all rhyme as **recurrence that won’t resolve to a first**.

---

### North Town / Northo: Murder Songs and the Authorless Burden

North Town sings with **two ledgers at once**: a melody for the square and a confession for the alley. A recurring margin hand whispers, “**missionary is the killer**” while indexes log knives, creeks, borrowed names. The Archive knows North by the Order **Violence & Secret Life**: public performance paired with concealed harm.

Northo is where we see the **mapmaker’s pickbox cart** with clarity: a small cart “not quite larger than a wheelbarrow” that **opens into rooms upon rooms**, trailed by **five women** walking “as if roped though they were not.” He refuses food; they refuse his. The burden moves under its own rule, answerable to no single author. The cart will later travel across ledgers (Northo → North → Dead River), behaving less like a possession than a **method** the Archive classifies with **Mediation & Aperture** (a traveling aperture) and, at times, **Doubling** (rooms within rooms).

---

### Tower of Mirado / Mirado Sticks: When Speech Withdraws into the Hand

The Tower keeps **recursive speech**—words that teach technique. A catechism, **“edges to edges,”** repeated at each misfit, eventually **moves the child’s hand without being spoken**. The Tower’s own documents recognize this as a hinge: speech lays a track, then **withdraws**, leaving practice in the body. This is the Order **Silence & Withdrawal**: not absence, but a method whose **voice is scaffold**—meant to disappear once the structure stands.

Across the river, **Mirado Sticks** is the place of **quiet-hours**, where routers spike on surveillance threads and aides say, “Come back during quiet hours.” They **re-mark silence at dawn** and start loops again: hands before words, bodies before feeds. The Sticks’ clinic keeps **withdrawal logs**—“many returns begin with a broken screen and end in hand-work”—and catalogs cases (Cassie, E., Ria) where silence recovers a local grammar. Tower and Sticks are opposites that fit: catechism installs method; quiet-hours **maintain** it.

---

### Dead River: A Town Installed by Map, a Journey Enabled by Fire

Dead River has “no river… no church… no words because no speech,” yet it **is** a town because a **map named it**; **from that map, another map, and from that one, ten**. The Archive reads this as **Mediation & Aperture** (a **map-device** confers townhood) crossed with **Doubling** (maps-of-maps). Passage here is also **device-first**: **only Yeller** could make the crossing by sharing a **canistered flame**—a **carried fire** that mediates survival and movement.

Culturally, **Dead River Whores**—book, game, comic, imprint—**broke the Capital’s imaginative monopoly** and its harvest of attention. It is the through-plot of the boroughs, re-centering appetite and authorship far from the window’s rim. In Dead River, the Archive learned to say plainly: devices (map, flame) make places **possible**.

---

### Traveling Figures and Codes: Yeller, the Five, the Pickbox, Castelia

**Yeller** is both figure and **five**. Alley trinkets show a **fivefold silhouette**; sightings multiply across Dead River and the Quarry; debates fixate on **maintenance across generations** (are they immortal?). The Archive reads Yeller’s **fivefold** as code that threads song, image, and route: **“A yeller bird is a little flock of five… a yeller girl is a missing child…”**—public melody and private confession in one stanza.

The **pickbox cart** is a **region unto itself**—Gunnr-wood, bone, leather, corners beyond corners. Its operator listens for a **count**—specifically **five**—in a girl’s tapping; counting recruits; the burden **encloses** its own geography. In North Town, a murder song reports the cart **rolling without him**, a method with no confessor—**picking** as the only author that remains.

**Castelia’s** **Hunt** copies reinforce the same ontology: burrs repeat, **wrists** drift, **jaws** fail to align; postcard and tin **invent** what the “originals” lack. The market wants a first; the slips offer a **chain**.

Across these figures, the **structural pattern is recurrence without origin**; the Archive calls that **Doubling** and keeps **Region** only as a witness tag.

---

### How the Regions Relate (Narrative Lines You Can Follow)

* **Edge ⇄ Device.** Dens’s moving edge meets Capital’s fixed apertures: both limit or permit passage, one by **grit**, the other by **window**. Densmok’s plot device mirrors the window’s rule—**form admits truth, not bodies**.

* **Roads ⇄ Rooms.** Quarry roads **bud** new roads; the pickbox cart **opens inward** to rooms upon rooms. The first proliferates **outside**, the second **inside**—two faces of the same doubling engine.

* **Song ⇄ Image ⇄ Number.** North’s murder songs keep a **second ledger**; Quarry’s woodcuts refuse an **original**; Dead River and Yeller tie both to the **number five**. The same code travels as rhyme, silhouette, recruitment meter.

* **Festival ⇄ Filing.** Capeast’s festival aftermath records **complaint before agency**; the Capital’s window logs show the same impulse—**govern passage**, stamp tolerances. One is a parish note; the other, an inspection schedule.

* **Catechism ⇄ Quiet-Hours.** Tower’s **“edges to edges”** installs technique; Sticks **re-mark** silence each dawn to keep it. Two halves of **Silence & Withdrawal**: a voice that teaches, then leaves; a practice that persists.

### Why the Archive Files by Orders First

This world repeatedly shows **device before place**. A **map** makes a town; a **canistered flame** makes a journey; a **window** makes a policy; a **cart** makes its own rooms. Meanwhile, regions **proliferate** (Quarry roads), contradict (Dens boundary), or travel (Yeller’s fivefold). The Archive therefore shelves by what the document **does**—aperture, doubling, craving, boundary, withdrawal, secret life—and only then notes where it was found.

If you keep one historian’s sentence in mind while writing slips, keep this: **in Densworld, mechanisms generate geographies, and patterns outlast places.** The Archive’s task is to file the mechanisms and patterns, then let regions testify.


---

## 1) What the Archive is (and isn’t)

**The Archive** is a fictional, rigorous catalog of primary documents from Densworld. Slips are filed first by **Order** (the reality a document performs) and second by **Region** (where it comes from)  . The six **Orders**:

1. **Boundary** — edges that won’t hold
2. **Doubling** — copies without origin
3. **Craving** — appetite as engine
4. **Silence & Withdrawal** — truth through quiet practice
5. **Violence & Secret Life** — parallel harm ledgers
6. **Mediation & Aperture** — devices/windows that govern access .

**Regions** are secondary tags the Archive still tracks: **Capital, Dens/Densmok, Quarry, North Town/Northo, Tower/Sticks, Dead River, Capeast** .

**Voice.** Archive slips are **in-character** records authored by Capital archivists: professional, fragment-preserving, interpretive, and deliberately unresolved .

**Debate vs Archive.** The `_debate/` collection narrates the institution’s reorganization (four phases, clerkly ↔ romantic ↔ philosophical tensions). Use it sparingly for context; your slip belongs to the Archive, not the Debate .

---

## 2) How the Capital Archive works (what your job feels like)

**Orders-first filing.** After years of arguing, the Archive files by **Order** first and **Region** second, with mandatory cross-indexing across both when relevant . The Debate phases document how we got here (Regional drawers → faults in geography → Orders proposal → implementation & objections) .

**Protocol 7.3 — how to cite a clip.** Each slip is built from **clips** (verbatim or close), labeled with a local **Slip Code**, **Provenance** (Region + record form), the **clip** itself, **Order tag(s)**, and a **1–3 sentence commentary** .

**Architecture as method.** In the Capital, **apertures** literally throttle knowledge: round **windows** allow slips but not bodies, and **stairs** meter crowds—filed under **Mediation & Aperture**  .

**Temperaments you’ll overhear.**

* **Clerkly** archivists love stamps and tolerances; distrust metaphysics.
* **Romantic** archivists narrativize, caring for witness voices.
* **Philosophical** archivists legislate categories and systems .
  Expect these voices in margin notes and cross-refs.

**Keep contradictions.** Do **not** reconcile conflicting testimony; disagreement is evidence and may itself determine the Order tag (e.g., **Boundary** or **Doubling**) .

---

## 3) Field atlas — the Regions at a glance (what they *do*, with flagship materials)

### Capital — Bureaucratic center; licensing and control

* **Apertures govern truth flow.** Windows limit passage to slips; stairs slow bodies—“knowledge may pass; bodies may not” (Order: **Mediation & Aperture**)  .
* **How to cite a clip** lives in Capital protocols; use the Slip/Provenance/Clip/Orders/Commentary template in every slip .

### Dens / Densmok — Edges, speech, and devices under constraint

* **Boundary town(s).** Dens is both town and wilderness; the line **moves with the hour** (Order: **Boundary**)  .
* **Densmok devices & “plot.”** Night-work scenes tie code to breath; devices define what counts as a plot (“two with closed eyes… **a plot is the intersection of their stares**”) (Orders: **Mediation & Aperture**, cross **Doubling/Craving**)   .

### Quarry / Yeller Quarry — Sources, journeys, fivefold images

* **Doubles with no origin.** Castelia’s **Hunt** woodcuts produce “fivefold silhouettes” whose **burrs** and **wrists** don’t line up; the market wants a single first cut, the slips refuse it (Order: **Doubling**)  .
* **Roads that bud**. Quarry journeys **proliferate** paths; each road **throws another** (Order: **Doubling**) .

### North Town / Northo — Murder songs & secret lives

* **Murder songs index.** Public melodies double as **private confessions**; “missionary is the killer” appears in margins (Order: **Violence & Secret Life**)  .
* **Pickbox cart (Northo file).** A cart “not larger than a wheelbarrow” opens into rooms; **five women** rope behind; who bears the burden is unresolved (cross-Region, cross-Order case)  .

### Tower of Mirado / Sticks — Catechism drills and withdrawal

* **Edges-to-edges (Tower).** Repetition makes **technique**; a rule enters the hand as speech recedes (Order: **Silence & Withdrawal**) .
* **Sticks quiet-hours.** Clinic boards, router sheets, and moderators’ notes reveal **silence as method** under surveillance pressure (Order: **Silence & Withdrawal**)  .

### Dead River — Counting systems, towns made by maps

* **A town named by a map.** With “no river… no speech,” the **map** installs the town; “from that map, another… and from that one, ten” (Orders: **Mediation & Aperture** + **Doubling**) .
* **Transit by device.** A **canistered flame** enables passage: **devices** make routes, not geography (Order: **Mediation & Aperture**) .
* **Craving taught on the street.** Handouts and a TV/comic franchise train appetites and launder harm (Orders: **Craving**, **Violence & Secret Life**, **Mediation & Aperture**)  .

### Capeast — Festival sites and women’s arrival stories

* **Pattern log (G2).** The mapmaker’s women arrive “ahead of the mapmaker,” clothing variants provoke **protests**; the paperwork tries to catch a moving seam (Orders: **Silence & Withdrawal**/**Boundary**)  .

---

## 4) Recurring devices & plots (your story-making toolbox)

* **The Pickbox Cart.** A traveling aperture “opening inside into rooms upon rooms,” shadowed by five women—perennially misfiled by Region, correctly seen as device-first (Orders: **Mediation & Aperture**; cross **Violence & Secret Life / Doubling**)  .
* **The Map that Makes a Town.** Dead River exists **because a map names it**; maps beget maps (Orders: **Mediation & Aperture**, **Doubling**) .
* **Yeller’s Fivefold.** Castelia’s silhouette and North’s “yeller stanza” are a **code** tying number to harm and desire (Orders: **Violence & Secret Life**, cross **Doubling**)  .
* **Edges to Edges.** The Tower drill and Sticks quiet-hours show how **language becomes habit**, then falls silent (Order: **Silence & Withdrawal**)  .
* **Capital Apertures.** Windows/stairs as **filters**: the city’s truth is throttled by openings and tolerances (Order: **Mediation & Aperture**) .

---

## 5) Characters and figures (as the Archive understands them)

* **The Mapmaker** — pulls the pickbox cart; sleeps while **five women** watch; routes touch Northo, North, Dead River, Capeast. The cart is **authorless burden** (debated); the women sometimes **precede the story** the records try to write  .
* **The Five Women** — walk “as one though they were five”; clothing patterns vary and trigger official **protests**; agency misread as offense (Orders: **Boundary**, **Silence & Withdrawal**, cross **Violence & Secret Life**)  .
* **Castelia** — artist of the **Hunt** woodcuts; provenance splinters into burrs, inks, copies (Order: **Doubling**) .
* **The Minor Archivist** — Capital clerk whose notes teach **aperture logic** (“I speak through the window”) (Order: **Mediation & Aperture**) .
* **Cassie, E., Ria** — Mirado Sticks “withdrawal” cases; each exhibits silence as method with differing complications (Order: **Silence & Withdrawal**) .
* **Queenmater (handouts)** — a street device teaching **Craving** in Dead River; also a forum flashpoint in Sticks logs  .
* **Varro & Kettel** — Debate voices: Varro formalizes Orders-first; Kettel warns metaphysics shapes speech. Their quarrel explains your slip’s **Orders-first** duty with **Region** as provenance  .

---

## 6) Orders → Examples (how to think like a filer)

* **Boundary** — Dens/Densmok stories where **town ↔ wilderness** keep trading places; Tower drills that draw a line then make it move  .
* **Doubling** — Quarry **roads** that bud; **fivefold** images and stanzas; **maps-of-maps** that install a site without origin   .
* **Craving** — Devices and markets that **teach appetite** (Dead River handouts/TV; Quarry commutes)  .
* **Silence & Withdrawal** — **Quiet-hours** and **catechisms** where hands keep the rule after speech stops  .
* **Violence & Secret Life** — North murder songs, **public melody / private confession**; Yeller’s **respectable commute** → **secret appetite**  .
* **Mediation & Aperture** — **Windows**, **carts**, **canistered fire**, **plot machines**: forms that **let truth pass** while holding bodies back   .

---

## 7) How to write your first slip (in character, step by step)

1. **Pick a thread** (ore → clip candidates). Example:

   * Densmok **plot** device lines (Stell/Frank scene) .
   * Quarry **fivefold** woodcut findings (burr lines; pose variance) .
   * Tower **“edges to edges”** catechism notes (child self-prompt) .

2. **Decide the Order (primary)** → then mark **Region (secondary)** using the canonical lists above .

3. **Pull 2–5 clips** and format with Protocol 7.3 (Slip Code; Provenance; `|| clip ||`; Orders; Commentary). **Keep contradictions** in view; they’re evidence  .

4. **Write the three sections** in order—**Provenance → Extract → Archivist’s Commentary**—arguing **why the Order fits** (not just the Region). Good models:
   **A1/A2** (Capital windows/stairs), **D1/D2** (Quarry doubles), **I1** (Sticks withdrawal) .

5. **Optional cross-index** one Debate doc that frames your choice (e.g., “Edges to Edges”; “Map Without River”)—but remember, the Archive is the shelf; Debate is history .

6. **Filename & front matter.**
   `[order]-[region]-[descriptive-slug]-[code].md` with the standard Archive **entry format** and layout `archive`  .

---

## 8) Ten quick seed prompts (copy, then find 2–3 clips)

* **Boundary · Densmok** — “Two kinds of story about Dens” vs ditch-readers’ ledgers → the edge moves; keep both accounts .
* **Doubling · Quarry** — “Roads that bud”: pull one colloquy minute + one junior registrar note; show **proliferation** .
* **Craving · Dead River** — Queenmater handouts + TV/comic **franchise**; docket “dose” as practice  .
* **Silence & Withdrawal · Sticks** — Router sheet spike + quiet-hours note; “speech after hands”  .
* **Violence & Secret Life · North** — Murder song index + “missionary” margin: melody ledger vs confession ledger .
* **Mediation & Aperture · Capital** — The Senate **stairs** + inspection tolerances; crowd-throttling as filing tool .
* **Mediation & Aperture · Northo/Dead River** — Pickbox **cart** + canistered **fire**; the device makes the journey possible  .
* **Doubling · Yeller Quarry/North** — “Yeller” stanza + **Hunt** woodcut: fivefold code across song and image  .
* **Boundary · Tower** — “Edges to edges” lesson plan + transfer to cutlery; a line that changes what it bounds .
* **Silence & Withdrawal · Capeast** — Clothing **pattern log** + protests; ordinance tries to catch agency .

---

## 9) Mini-glossary (the Archive’s sense of the terms)

* **Aperture** — Any device or opening that **permits slips** but denies bodies; more broadly, any mechanism that **makes a site legible** (Capital windows; pickbox cart; Dead River map)  .
* **Fivefold** — A number that travels through songs, silhouettes, and routes; usually **recurrence without origin** (hence **Doubling**)  .
* **Quiet-hours** — Sticks practice of putting **hands before words**; surveillance changes tempo, so silence is **re-marked** at dawn .
* **Provenance vs Order.** Provenance is where a record comes from; **Order** is what it **does**. Orders are primary; Regions are secondary—by policy and by hard-won argument in the Debate  .

---

## 10) Submission sanity-check

* ✅ **Order first; Region second** (with cross-index if the device crosses towns) .
* ✅ **Clips follow Protocol 7.3** (Slip/Provenance/Clip/Orders/Commentary) .
* ✅ **Contradictions preserved** (mark, don’t fix) .
* ✅ **Voice stays archivist-in-character** (analytical, fragment-preserving) .

---
