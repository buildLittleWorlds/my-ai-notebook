## Archivist's Commentary

This window is not a door. The rule is design: knowledge may pass; bodies may not. The South Arcade
aperture keeps our trade in fragments clean—calipered, lacquered, measured to a tolerance that
flatters the Senate-house. Still, the world outside salts our ledgers: Quarry dust, Dens grit, the
odd smear that will not wash. We note the contaminations because they are the cost of testimony.
The Capital's method—clarity, separation, the round hole smaller than a skull—works until the slip
itself arrives with its own weather. Then we re-lacquer and file the weather with the text.
