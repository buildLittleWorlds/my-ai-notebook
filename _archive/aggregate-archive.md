title: "Archive Post C1 — Dens: Boundary Sludge Meter Readings (west-ditch series, yrs 17–19)"
order: "Boundary"
region: "Dens"
catalog_code: "C1"
excerpt: "The staff reads what the mouths say. Our sticks rise with the stories of swallowing, fall with the stories of safe streets."
---

**Catalog Code:** C1

## Provenance

West Ditch Survey, field staff *R-5* through *R-7*; monthly stick-depth and pan-grit captures.
Auxiliary transcripts from tavern stools on the western road (compiled by lane-runners).
Labels standardized by South Arcade Registrar's office (Year 20, Q1).

## Extract — Boundary Accounts

> In one account: Dens is "a regular town… on the edge of the western wilderness."
> In the other: "the wilderness… always in danger of sinking [the town] further into it,"
> with grit "heaping… by the day" until "the one will be indistinguishable from the other."

## Meter Series — West Ditch (Years 17–19)

| Month | Y17 Depth (cm) | Y18 Depth (cm) | Y19 Depth (cm) | Notes |
|-------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Frost | 18 | 22 | 27 | Grit coarsening; 3 cracked pans |
| Thaw | 31 | 35 | 41 | Sludge "creeps" across marker stones |
| Seed | 24 | 29 | 36 | Two homes report porchline loss |
| High Sun | 19 | 23 | 28 | Temporary retreat after ditching |
| Harvest | 26 | 33 | 39 | Sticky pull under footbridges |
| Black | 34 | 40 | 47 | Overtop at culverts R-6 & R-7 |

## Archivist's Commentary

The staff reads what the mouths say. Our sticks rise with the stories of swallowing,
fall with the stories of safe streets. The boundary does not stay put: it moves with the hour,
the season, the ditching. We file these numbers beside the stool transcripts, not to reconcile
them, but to keep the circle whole: town and wilderness reading through each other. When a porch
line vanishes overnight, we note it the way we note a new proverb—evidence of where the edge went
while no one was watching.

title: "Archive Post B2 — Densmok: Two Kinds of Story about Dens (oral histories, stool transcripts)"
order: "Boundary"
region: "Densmok"
catalog_code: "B2"
excerpt: "Town and wilderness read like two halves of a circle our witnesses keep turning through: settlement becoming exile, exile folding back into a harder settlement."
---

**Catalog Code:** B2

## Provenance

Compiled from west-edge Densmok stool transcripts and lane interviews; cross-checked with
ditch-readers' ledgers and three roadside sermons recovered from the north spur into Dens.

## Extract

> There are two kinds of story you'll hear about Dens.
> In one: a regular town—dirty, small, out on the edge.
> In the other: the wilderness itself is alive, thickening by the day, pushing up against houses
> until streets and buildings are only the faintest rises under the grit. In either telling, the name
> *Dens* belongs as much to the wilderness as to the town—and some say the two are already the same.

## Archivist's Commentary

The accounts refuse to stay separate. "Town" and "wilderness" read like two halves of a circle
our witnesses keep turning through: settlement becoming exile, exile folding back into a harder
settlement. We have no single "before" and "after" here, only a loop of approaches where each
version makes the other legible. Readers who want a stable Dens must accept a moving boundary:
every whole appears only through its parts—and the parts keep drifting.

## File: ./boundary-tower-edges-to-edges-h1.md

---
title: "Archive Post H1 — Tower of Mirado: 'Edges to Edges' (puzzle catechism notes)"
order: "Boundary"
region: "Tower of Mirado"
catalog_code: "H1"
excerpt: "A rule repeated until it turns itself: the Tower's way is to make speech lay the track for the hand. The child's voice carries the fit forward; the picture follows later."
---

**Catalog Code:** H1

## Provenance

Tutor's notebook recovered from a Tower-adjacent instruction room; marginalia by a parent-scribe.
Supplementary pages from a catechetical handout filed under "Repetition & Fit." Copied twice
by Capital junior clerks; Tower origin unconfirmed.

## Extract

> "Edges to edges," said at each misfit; the child turns the piece. 
> Repetition of language creates the experience of fit—and the possibility of communication.

## Lesson Record — Unit 3: Fitting

- **Drill:** identify edges; rotate non-edges; retry without prompt
- **Chorus:** class repeats rule before each attempt ("edges to edges")
- **Observation:** self-prompt emerges in child after 7–9 repetitions
- **Transfer:** rule applied to a different picture (pond → cabin)

## Archivist's Commentary

A rule repeated until it turns itself: the Tower's way is to make speech lay the track for the hand.
The child's voice carries the fit forward; the picture follows later. We file this with confession
manuals and rehab scripts not to collapse them but to keep their cadence together: repetition that
builds a world of correct joins, taught at the table one corner at a time.

## File: ./craving-densmok-theorists-shadow-b1.md

title: "Archive Post B1 — Densmok: Theorists in the Shadow (mind-node rigs catalog)"
order: "Craving"
region: "Densmok"
catalog_code: "B1"
excerpt: "Densmok works in the shadow of the Capital, but the shadow is a workshop. The 'singers' treat code as breath and beat; their rigs splice chant to patch."
---

**Catalog Code:** B1

## Provenance

Compiled by Junior Registrar M. Leth (seconded to Densmok). Sources: alley shop receipts, street-lab
inventories, tutor-stool transcripts from "singers" (coder-performers), and four confiscations logged
by Cap auxiliaries. Cross-checked against mnemonist pairing reports at the Quarry line.

## Extract — Registered Rigs (selected)

| Rig / Handle | Build Notes | Use-Method | Observed Side-Effects |
|-------------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Node-3 "Broomhandle"** | Walnut dowel spine; three copper knuckles; clinic-cast ear-cuff | Hummed stanza to prime; finger-tap 5-count to engage | Ear-ringing; doubled whisper; brief dream bleed |
| **Tin-Ear 2.1** | Roof-tin plates; scavenged radio coil; soot-strung leads | Call-and-response "singing"; two voices recommended | Speech stutter on exit; delayed afterimages |
| **Frege-Patch ("Just Pete")** | Ledger vellum over waxboard; pinwheel selector; blue chalk | Trace letters until "click"; recite stock proofs | Compulsive recitation; taste of salt and graphite |
| **Mind-Node "Tin Chapel"** | Milk-crate chassis; six-node crown; bellwire ligature | Low chant; neighbor holds the crown steady | Momentary blackout; paired mirroring with bystander |

## Archivist's Commentary

Densmok works in the shadow of the Capital, but the shadow is a workshop. The "singers" treat code
as breath and beat; their rigs splice chant to patch. We file two routes upward: the *node*
pipeline (coders grooming their signal for the city) and the *pairing* pipeline (mnemonists
who double and mirror in the Quarry style). Interference between the two is common: a node crown
picks up a pairing echo; a pairing run jams a node stanza. What the Capital calls derivative feels
here like invention under constraint. We record the stutters, hums, and afterimages because the
side-effects are part of the method: the work leaves a mark where it passes.

title: "Archive Post D2 — Yeller Quarry: Bagbu on Roads & Doubles (archive district minutes)"
order: "Doubling"
region: "Quarry"
catalog_code: "D2"
excerpt: "We were instructed once to identify an origin and a fork. The slips will not allow it. What looks like a duplicate keeps making new directions."
---

**Catalog Code:** D2

## Provenance

Minutes from the Bagbu colloquy ("On Roads"), Capital archives district, with addenda from border
runners; annotations by a junior registrar regarding "journeys that breed journeys."

## Extract

> Every true journey begins in the Quarry, they say, and pushes toward the desert and its tower.
> But midway a second road buds off inside the first—sometimes years earlier than anyone can date.
> The maps cannot agree which is the copy and which is the line. Each path throws another.

## Archivist's Commentary

We were instructed once to identify an origin and a fork. The slips will not allow it. What looks
like a duplicate keeps making new directions; what looks like a main road is already a seam.
Our ledger overflows whenever we try to count. For Quarry matters we recommend a different verb:
not "to begin," but "to proliferate."

## File: ./doubling-quarry-hunt-silhouettes-d1.md

---
title: "Archive Post D1 — Yeller Quarry: The Hunt Silhouettes (Castelia woodcuts, provenance file)"
order: "Doubling"
region: "Quarry"
catalog_code: "D1"
excerpt: "The market wants a single cut—an origin to worship. The slips refuse it. Even where the burr repeats, the wrists don't; even where the jaw aligns, the paper lies."
---

**Catalog Code:** D1

## Provenance

Five woodcuts attributed to *Castelia*, acquired from Capital alley dealers (Lot 41–45).
Dealer bills claim "Yeller Quarry Hunt" origin; two impressions bear alley-stamp ink, one has a
partial chapel watermark. Comparison set includes three postcard-scale copies and one painted
facsimile on tin. Lot intake photographed and dusted; edges measured against known Castelia blocks.

## Extract — Trade & Image

> "The fivefold figure in silhouette… the famous Yeller Quarry Hunt depiction by Castelia."
> Trinket images sold in Capital alleys as patron-saint mementos; more sightings claimed in Dead River,
> fewer in the Capital; almost none who claim to have truly seen her.

## Findings — Block & Copy

- **Block-line:** Two cuts share a burr consistent with Castelia's late period; three do not.
- **Ink & stock:** Alley-ink mix on all; chapel watermark likely a pasted backing.
- **Pose-variance:** Silhouettes differ at wrists and jawline; "fivefold" reads as seam, not count.
- **Copy-chain:** Postcard set copies the burr but loses the wrist flare; tin facsimile invents both.

## Archivist's Commentary

The market wants a single cut—an origin to worship. The slips refuse it. Even where the burr
repeats, the wrists don't; even where the jaw aligns, the paper lies. We file the images as a
chase that throws its own doubles: a line of impressions that will not resolve to first or fifth.
As for the sightings, we keep the trinkets with the testimonies. Both are silhouette-work: light
around a body the ledgers cannot catch.

## File: ./GRAD-STUDENT-WORKFLOW.md

# Graduate Student Workflow: Building a New **Notebook** Entry (Orders-first)

**You are adding to the archive itself.** The **Notebooks** are the shelves; the **Archivists’ Debate** is just backstory/context you may cite. The catalog files slips by **Order** (primary) with **Region** as secondary provenance【】, and the hub already exposes both an **Orders index** and a legacy **Finder by Region**【】【】.

---

## 0) Prereqs & Where your file goes

* Run the site locally with Jekyll: `bundle install` → `bundle exec jekyll serve` (URL in README)【】.
* Your new entry lives in the **`_notebooks/`** collection and renders with the `notebook` layout【】.
* Use the Order-Primary filename pattern: `[order]-[region]-[descriptive-slug]-[code].md` (e.g., `mediation-capital-window-aperture-a1.md`, `doubling-quarry-hunt-silhouettes-d1.md`)【】【】.

---

## 1) Choose your **source** (“ore”)

Pick one thread from the Densworld “ore” files (e.g., **Yeller Quarry**, **Densmok**, **North/Northo**, **Tower/Sticks**, **Dead River**, **Capital**, **Capeast**). These supply your **verbatim clips**. Example ore lines you might mine:

* Yeller Quarry witness account (class drift between respectability/appetite)【】.
* Densmok coder/night-work scene (devices, counting, screen-to-body drift)【】【】.

> Rule of thumb: **your unit of truth is a *clip*** (verbatim or near-verbatim), wrapped in protocol and indexed【】.

---

## 2) Classify by **Order** (primary) → then mark **Region** (secondary)

Use the Orders as working lenses to decide **what the slip *does***:

* **Boundary**: edges that won’t hold (Dens meters vs testimony)【】
* **Doubling**: proliferations; copies without origin (Quarry roads; Castelia fivefold)【】
* **Craving**: desire that makes artifacts (Densmok rigs; Capeast aftermath)【】
* **Silence & Withdrawal**: hands before words; drills that become method (Tower catechism; Sticks quiet-hours)【】
* **Violence & Secret Life**: parallel harm ledgers; North murder songs【】
* **Mediation & Aperture**: devices, windows, carts constrain access【】

Then tag **Region** using the standard geography list (Capital, Dens/Densmok, Quarry, North/Northo, Tower/Sticks, Dead River, Capeast)【】.

---

## 3) Pull 2–5 **Clips** using Protocol 7.3

Follow the **“How to Cite a Clip”** template already in the notebooks aggregate:

```
Slip: [CODE] — [TITLE]
Provenance: [REGION] · [FORM]
Clip: || [VERBATIM EXCERPT] ||
Order(s): [ORDER-1][; ORDER-2]
Commentary: [ARCHIVIST NOTE, 1–3 sentences]
```

Keep contradictions; they are evidence【】【】.

**Example clip pulls (ready to paste):**

* `|| I’d known rich folk … sneak away to Yeller Quarry … eat off greasy tables and get off on greasy thighs … then drive back home to shower off and straighten out. ||` → Provenance: Quarry · Witness Account → **Orders:** Violence & Secret Life; Craving【】
* `|| Two people with their eyes closed … A plot is the intersection of their stares. ||` → Provenance: Densmok · Device Scene/Software Note → **Orders:** Mediation & Aperture (form constrains truth)【】

---

## 4) Create the **frontmatter** & file

Use the site’s standard **Notebook Entry Format**:

```yaml
---
title: "Archive Post [CODE] — [REGION]: [TITLE] ([DOCUMENT TYPE])"
order: "[ONE OF SIX ORDERS]"
region: "[GEOGRAPHIC REGION]"
catalog_code: "[ALPHANUMERIC CODE]"
excerpt: "[KEY QUOTE FROM COMMENTARY]"
---
```

This is exactly what the collection expects【】.
**File path:** `_notebooks/[order]-[region]-[descriptive-slug]-[code].md` (e.g., `_notebooks/mediation-densmok-plot-aperture-b3.md`)【】.

---

## 5) Write the three sections

* **Provenance** — *where the material came from and in what form* (e.g., “Quarry · Witness account; alley bills; repair ledger”)【】.
* **Extract** — your **clips** in blockquotes / `|| … ||` with minimal framing【】.
* **Archivist’s Commentary** — 2–6 paragraphs that argue why this fits the chosen **Order** (not just the Region). Keep mismatches in view; do not reconcile them【】【】.

> Touchstone examples to imitate:
>
> * **A1 — Capital: Window Aperture** (Mediation & Aperture)【】【】
> * **D1/D2 — Yeller Quarry: Doubles** (provenance vs. copies)【】【】
> * **I1 — Sticks: Withdrawal Logs** (silence as method)【】【】

---

## 6) Cross-index (optional but encouraged)

Your notebook entry can point to **one** Debate doc that frames your choice (history/context), e.g.:

* Phase II **“Edges to Edges”** (why Withdrawal is a method) → `/debate/phase2-colloquy-edges-to-edges/`【】
* Phase II **Counting/Cart** cases (doubling; device-first filing)【】

Remember: the Debate is meta-history; the **Notebook** is the shelf. Use the Debate sparingly to **justify** the Order-first filing the hub already announces【】.

---

## 7) Build & test

* `bundle exec jekyll serve` → Navigate to `.../notebooks/[order]-[region]-[descriptive-slug]-[code]/` and check frontmatter renders, links work【】.
* Your entry will appear under the correct **Order** in the Notebooks hub (and in the Region finder) automatically【】【】.

---

## 8) Submission checklist (Notebooks)

* [ ] File in `_notebooks/` named `[order]-[region]-[descriptive-slug]-[code].md`【】
* [ ] Frontmatter matches **Entry Format**【】
* [ ] **Order** chosen from the six; **Region** marked as provenance【】【】
* [ ] ≥2 Clips, Protocol 7.3 formatting; contradictions intact【】【】
* [ ] **Commentary** argues the Order-first reasoning (not just geography)【】

---

## 9) Worked mini-example (you can copy-edit into a real post)

**Filename:** `_notebooks/mediation-densmok-plot-aperture-b3.md`

```yaml
---
title: "Archive Post B3 — Densmok: Plot by Aperture (device scene & store notes)"
order: "Mediation & Aperture"
region: "Densmok"
catalog_code: "B3"
excerpt: "Two closed eyes make a plot; the device makes the truth pass, not the bodies."
---
```

**Provenance**
Densmok · Night-work at **Softwares** (storefront); coder scene; screen output note.

**Extract**

> || Two people with their eyes closed. No touching. No speaking. No moving to make noise. Each stares ahead. **A plot is the intersection of their stares.** ||【】

**Archivist’s Commentary**
The **form** makes the truth: a rule that **constrains bodies** so that only a plotted **intersection** may pass. This fits **Mediation & Aperture**—like the Capital’s window (“no door; slips only”), the Densmok apparatus filters access by design【】. Cross-index to **A1 Window Aperture** for the shared principle that **knowledge may pass; bodies may not**【】. Region remains Densmok (provenance), but the shelf is the **Order**.

(*Optional “Further reading” link for the student editor: Phase II **Edges to Edges** on method-as-withdrawal, for kinship of technique becoming bodily habit【】.*)

---

## 10) Quick “what next” prompts (pick one and go)

* **Quarry → Violence & Secret Life (cross Craving):** Take the Yeller double-life stanza/witness stream and build a slip on **parallel ledgers** (respectability vs appetite)【】.
* **Dead River → Doubling:** Build a **Counting-Five** dossier (tap, cart, shrine misses) using the case register style from existing entries【】【】.
* **Tower/Sticks → Silence & Withdrawal:** Pair a Tower drill clip with a Sticks quiet-hours ledger to show **silence as method**【】【】.

---

### Why this workflow matches the site’s logic

* The Notebooks hub explicitly **adopts Orders-first** and points readers to the Debate only as history【】.
* The README anchors **Orders** and **Regions** and defines the **entry format** your file must follow【】【】.
* The aggregate shows how to **cite clips** and to **preserve contradictions** inside the slip itself【】【】.

## Archivist's Commentary

The Capital makes architecture do the filing. The aperture governs what may cross (paper, not flesh);
the stairwell governs how fast. We shelve this under *Mediation & Aperture*: the city's truth is
throttled by its openings. The "minor" voice is not a confession but a measurement of pressure at the rim.

excerpt: "This window is not a door. The rule is design: knowledge may pass; bodies may not."
---

**Catalog Code:** A1

## Provenance

South Arcade Licensing Board: *Quarterly Caliper Inspections*, Annex II (signed by Registrar Tollo).
Supplementary spot-check memoranda from Senate-house perimeter inspectors regarding window rims and breach seals.

## Extract

> **1. Aperture Spec.** Face-window shall be circular; clear diameter not to exceed one-third cranial width of licensed archivist on duty. No door; no walk-in ingress. Exchange of slips only.
> 
> **2. Tolerance.** ±2 mm on interior rim; hairline fissures to be tar-inked and re-lacquered within 24 hours.
> 
> **3. Incidents Noted.** Two instances of grit-induced feed distortion ("static") during receipt of Quarry hunt sketches; one instance of Dens-residue on ledger paper; all remediated with double-lining and bristle-brush cleanse.
> 
> **4. Status.** PASS. Advisory: re-check lacquer before festival week.

## Archivist's Commentary

This window is not a door. The rule is design: knowledge may pass; bodies may not. The South Arcade
aperture keeps our trade in fragments clean—calipered, lacquered, measured to a tolerance that
flatters the Senate-house. Still, the world outside salts our ledgers: Quarry dust, Dens grit, the
odd smear that will not wash. We note the contaminations because they are the cost of testimony.
The Capital's method—clarity, separation, the round hole smaller than a skull—works until the slip
itself arrives with its own weather. Then we re-lacquer and file the weather with the text.

title: "Archive Post F1 — Dead River: The Counting-Five Cases (Miasto–Gunnr Dossier)"
order: "Mediation & Aperture"
region: "Dead River"
catalog_code: "F1"
excerpt: "The number draws the watcher as much as the watcher draws the number. Five appears first as a child's tap and ends as a silhouette for sale."
---

**Catalog Code:** F1

## Provenance

Collated from alley reports in Miasto (Quarry capital), two road-watch logs outside the gates,
and a series of northern depositions from Gunnr villages regarding a man with a pickbox cart.
Supplemented by trinket-trade notes on the fivefold hunt silhouette, filed for iconographic cross-check.

## Extract

> "He looked for girls… He watched for a counting tap… There was a number he was after. Five."
> 
> "Miasto… the man was a northerner… His pickbox cart waited outside… its hollows ready…"
> 
> "You will have heard of Yeller… the fivefold figure in silhouette…"

## Case Register — Counting-Five (selected)

| Site | Subject | Indicator | Cart Proximity | Disposition |
|------|---------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Miasto, alley corner | Girl (~5), barefoot, alone | Toe-tap in repeating five | Cart sighted outside north gate | Unresolved (observer breaks off) |
| Road out of Miasto | Unknown child (age unknown) | Shoulder jerk (1–1–2–1) | Cart odor (leather/boar) reported | Unconfirmed |
| Gunnr village edge | Two girls (7, 9) | Finger-count whispered "five" | Cart wheels heard past midnight | Family relocated; no follow-up |
| Quarry border shrine | Girl (~10) | Tap ceased at shrine lights | No cart; fivefold silhouette tokens sold nearby | Returned home |

## Archivist's Commentary

The number draws the watcher as much as the watcher draws the number. Five appears first as a child's
tap and ends as a silhouette for sale. Between those two ledgers—the road and the market—walks the cart
that opens inward. We record the misses alongside the sightings because absence also leaves a trail:
the odor on a road, the hush at a shrine, the family that packs by dawn. There is no arrest here, only
a pattern tightening. We keep the pattern for when someone asks who began it.

catalog_code: "F2"
excerpt: "The overlap is not a merger but a pressure point: Capeast pedagogy brushes the Dead River mythos and leaves a seam that later readers misname as origin."
---

**Catalog Code:** F2

## Provenance

Compiled from *Dead River* school folios ("5000s" set), Capeast sandbox memos referencing
Ria Levins's early work, and alley-shop ephemera linking Yeller silhouettes to Dead River routes.

## Extract

> || "One possibility is to make 5000s the only place where Ria's Dead River work and the Capeast School overlap…
> Maybe it's early work by Ria playing in the Densworld sandbox before doing her own thing." ||
> 
> || "You will have heard of Yeller… the fivefold figure in silhouette… how can a single fivefold being—
> five women-one being—maintain itself over generations?… Though what you might ask is whether the man in the
> pickbox cart might be himself some kind of immortal…" ||

## Archivist's Commentary

The overlap is not a merger but a pressure point: Capeast pedagogy brushes the Dead River mythos and
leaves a seam that later readers misname as origin. The fivefold Yeller and the pickbox man turn the
question of "continuity" inside out—are we tracking persons, or patterns? For the 5000s we file the overlap
as a rehearsal space where an artist's method (Levins) tests the market's silhouettes (Yeller) and the cart's
interior world (pickbox) without resolving who lasts. The dossier keeps the seam visible so later datings
don't harden into firsts.

# Archive Collection — Section Guide

## Purpose & Role in Site Structure

**The Archive** contains **fictional primary documents** from Densworld (in-character). These are the actual slips, testimonies, and fragments that Densworld archivists collect, file, and study. This is pure creative fiction presented as archival scholarship.

### Position in Site Ecosystem:
1. **Blog Posts** (real-world essays, out-of-character)
2. **Romantic Quick Kit** (real theory, out-of-character)  
3. **AI Hermeneutics Kit** (real theory, out-of-character)
4. **The Archive** ← *You are here* (fictional Densworld documents, in-character)
5. **The Debate** (fictional Densworld meta-discussion, in-character)

### Relationship to Debate Collection:
- **The Archive** = Primary documents being filed and studied
- **The Debate** = Institutional discussions about how to organize these documents
- Both are part of the same fictional world, but serve different narrative functions

## Archival System Structure

### The Six Orders (Primary Classification):
Documents are filed by **what reality they perform**, not geographic origin:

1. **Boundary** — Where edges blur between categories (town/wilderness, forms)
2. **Doubling** — Replication, copies, journeys within journeys, originals without origin  
3. **Craving** — Desire as generative force, drives, appetites, proliferations
4. **Silence & Withdrawal** — Where speech collapses, truth through quiet practice
5. **Violence & Secret Life** — Parallel ledgers of harm and hidden motives
6. **Mediation & Aperture** — Windows, devices, how world is constrained by perception

### Geographic Regions (Secondary Classification):
- **Capital** — Bureaucratic center, licensing, formal procedures
- **Dens/Densmok** — Edge settlements, wilderness boundaries  
- **Quarry** — Source of materials, journeys, multiplicities
- **North Town/Northo** — Murder songs, secret lives, doubled identities
- **Tower/Sticks** — Withdrawal practices, catechisms, clinic work
- **Dead River** — Counting systems, numerical mysteries
- **Capeast** — Festival sites, women's arrival stories

## Writing Voice & Style

- **Archival voice**: Professional, analytical, preserving ambiguity
- **In-character**: Written by fictional Densworld archivists
- **Fragmentary**: Documents are incomplete, mysterious, evocative
- **Interpretive**: Archivist commentary explains filing decisions

## Content Guidelines & Entry Format

### Required Structure:

```
Example: `boundary-dens-sludge-meter-readings-c1.md`

### What Belongs Here:
- Fictional primary source documents from Densworld
- Fragmented testimonies, field reports, measurements, observations

### Navigation:
- Accessible from homepage tile "Quarry Notebooks"
- Listed on `/notebooks/` hub page (auto-generated by Order)
- Individual URLs: `/notebooks/:name/`
- Hub includes link to related `/debate/archivists-debate/`

### Cross-Reference Linking:
Use Jekyll's relative_url filter for internal links:

```

## Fictional World Consistency

### Core Premise:
Densworld archivists have developed a revolutionary filing system based on **interpretive categories** (Orders) rather than **geographic categories** (regions). This creates ongoing institutional tension documented in the Debate collection.

### Narrative Coherence:
- Each entry must authentically represent its assigned Order through content
- Regional details should be consistent across entries
- Archivist commentary should reflect institutional voice and methodology
- Documents should feel genuinely fragmentary and mysterious

### Integration with Debate Collection:
The Archive provides the **primary materials** that the Debate documents discuss organizing. Debate references should align with actual Archive contents.

## Current Status

- **18+ entries** representing all six Orders across multiple regions
- **Consistent archival methodology** with systematic filing rationale
- **Rich fictional world** with geographic and institutional coherence
- **Evocative fragments** that reward careful reading and interpretation

This collection serves as the creative heart of the site's fictional world—a rigorous but mysterious archive that demonstrates interpretive principles through narrative rather than exposition.

title: "Archive Post G1 — Capeast: Festival Aftermath Report (Mapmaker's Women Arrival)"
order: "Silence & Withdrawal"
region: "Capeast"
catalog_code: "G1"
excerpt: "Capeast is an after—after work, after city, after festival. We note how arrivals unsettle the cleanup: five women, same step, no cart, no master, appetite held in reserve."
---

**Catalog Code:** G1

## Provenance

Capeast harvest-festival incident file. Street-sweeper notes; bench-righting rota; three tavern
stool transcripts; one parish warden memorandum. Intake by Alley Ward (Cap east spur), with
cross-notes to *Bare on Their Backs* apparel complaints.

## Extract

> It was a festival night… the night after the festival of harvest… 
> The mapmaker's women arrived ahead of the mapmaker.

## Witness Ledger (selected)

| Witness | Locale | Observation | Action Logged |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| J. Marn (sweeper) | Square, south end | "Five of them, same step, no mapmaker. Backs marked in a bare ring." | None |
| Parish warden | Steps by chapel | Protest re: apparel; advised they cover shoulders; women declined | Note sent to Alley Ward |
| Vendor "Kix" | Stall #12 | Rumor: "He lets them choose"; two customers asked for private viewing | Referral to warden; no charge filed |
| Innkeeper "Bela" | North rooms | Women ate nothing offered; waited in silence; watched the stair | Room fee waived; record kept |

## Archivist's Commentary

Capeast is an after—after work, after city, after festival. We note how arrivals unsettle
the cleanup: five women, same step, no cart, no master, appetite held in reserve. Grievances
rise first to apparel and only then to agency, as if cloth were the hinge of consent. Our
file keeps what the night tried to smooth over: that the women arrived before the story did,
and the story—when it comes—will be forced to catch up to their pace.

region: "Capeast"
catalog_code: "G2"
excerpt: "Capeast files spectacle as ordinance: the same step becomes a citation when cloth turns hinge. The pattern log shows variety by design—self-chosen fittings."
---

**Catalog Code:** G2

## Provenance

Pattern log compiled after the Harvest Festival (Capeast Ward notes, Alley Watch intake);
appended parish protests and market-stall testimonies from the same night.

## Extract

> || "It was a festival night… the night after the festival of harvest… The mapmaker's women arrived ahead of the mapmaker." ||
> 
> || "The mapmaker's women were clothed in a pattern that shifted each time they were seen…
> covering up one breast on one of the women and leaving the other bare and covering both on all the others
> but leaving a core circle on those four women bare on their backs. This brought curiosity and protest
> wherever the mapmaker journeyed." ||

## Archivist's Commentary

Capeast files spectacle as ordinance: the same step becomes a citation when cloth turns hinge.
The pattern log shows variety by design—self-chosen fittings—yet the protests read choice as threat,
converting arrival into a paperwork queue. We keep both ledgers: the shifting variants (agency in dress)
and the complaints (agency misread as offense). The women precede their story; the records lag behind,
trying to catch a moving seam with stationary rules.

order: "Silence & Withdrawal"
region: "Mirado Sticks"
catalog_code: "H2"
excerpt: "The Sticks treat silence as a method, not a void: many returns begin with a broken screen and end in hand-work."
---

**Catalog Code:** H2

## Provenance

Sticks · Web-archive export of a local forum ("Mirado Clinic board," Y22–Y23),
matched against router logs kept by a clinic aide; addendum from a volunteer moderator's
"quiet-hours" notebook (no-screens mornings).

## Extract

> **Router Sheet (02:13–02:27):** Spike on /queenmater thread; referrers: *former.io* mirror;
> *def.mil* crawler family seen in header. Three logins after midnight, two from alley Wi-Fi repeater. "E." removes embeds; thread switches to plain text.
> 
> **Forum Capture (mod screenshot, 02:31):** User *former_guest*: "We archive because the Sticks delete. Your 'withdrawals' prove the Tower model." Reply (clinic aide): "We don't 'delete'; we put speech after hands. Come back during quiet hours."
> 
> **Quiet-Hours Note (margin):** "Traffic is attention-shaped. When the crawler comes, the voices speed up, then stall. We re-mark silence at dawn and start loops again."

## Archivist's Commentary

The Sticks treat silence as a method, not a void: many returns begin with a broken screen and end in hand-work.
The forum shows how surveillance reorders tempo—posts accelerate at the glance of the crawler, then the
off-switch restores the local grammar where words go last and hands go first. We shelve this under
*Silence & Withdrawal*. (Cross-ref: Sticks withdrawal logs for Cassie, E., Ria.)

title: "Archive Post I1 — Mirado Sticks: Withdrawal Logs (return-to-body reports)"
order: "Silence & Withdrawal"
region: "Mirado Sticks"
catalog_code: "I1"
excerpt: "In the Sticks, truth is something you stop saying to see if it stays. Many returns begin with a broken screen and end in hand-work."
---

**Catalog Code:** I1

## Provenance

Sticks clinic intake cards; two "return-to-body" journals; roadside interviews with art students;
one Tower memo on Sticks non-compliance ("silence escalation"). Collected on the downstate routes.

## Extract

> A place like America not too long ago… but also a thousand years in the future. 
> Stasis since about 1990; a small group in the Tower lives by turning the world into raw material
> for their virtual lives. In the Sticks people disengage from screens and reenter the physical world.

## Withdrawal Register (selected)

| Case | Trigger | Method | Complication | Status |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|--------|
| MS-07 ("Cassie") | Screen blackouts / puzzle practice | No-speech mornings; walking loops; hand-work | Honesty collapse; "words snag" sensation | Maintains silence days; draws at night |
| MS-11 ("E.") | Clinic mandate | Cold-turkey from feeds; farm shifts | Dream bleed from Tower scripts | Relapses weekly; returns to field |
| MS-15 ("Ria") | Art school exit | Song without audience; long drives | Silence escalates to refusal | Non-compliant; status unknown |

## Archivist's Commentary

In the Sticks, truth is something you stop saying to see if it stays. Many returns begin with a
broken screen and end in hand-work: puzzles, drawing, walking a loop until the body remembers its
turn radius. We file the silence as a method, not a void. The Tower names this non-compliance; we
keep it as a local grammar where words go last and hands go first.

region: "Tower"
catalog_code: "I2"
excerpt: "The Tower's drill makes speech lay the track for the hand—but the child's speech keeps laying tracks of its own."
---

**Catalog Code:** I2

## Provenance

Tower · Instructor lesson logs (Y18–Y21) and "anomalies register" slips from the Mirado schoolroom;
compiled after puzzle-catechism sessions ("edges to edges") with follow-up speech observations.

## Extract

> **Slip 4:** After nine repetitions of the puzzle rule, subject self-prompts correctly.
> In free talk, says: "Blue is baby," then clarifies by pointing to the mother's apron (blue gingham).
> Later in the week: "Apple means mother," used whenever lunch bell sounds. Instructor notes *register-shift*:
> rule language migrates into kinship talk.
> 
> **Slip 7:** Subject whispers "edges to edges" while aligning cutlery; when corrected to
> "spoons and spoons," replies: "Edges are for babies." Teacher remarks: *connotation drift*—the procedural
> phrase accrues age-value, then social value, without explicit instruction.
> 
> **Slip 11:** During picture transfer (pond → cabin), subject names the frame "home"
> and refuses "house," insisting: "Home is when the blue is on." (Apron absent that day.)

## Archivist's Commentary

The Tower's drill makes speech lay the track for the hand—but the child's speech keeps laying tracks of its own.
A procedural rule ("edges to edges") begets a private lexicon where colors pick up kinship, and steps on a puzzle
board appear as steps toward a person. We file this under *Silence & Withdrawal* to keep it beside
the catechism notes: repetition builds fit; fit spills into meaning.

## Archivist's Commentary

She arrives as a mechanic and leaves as a rumor. The cards disagree on her marks (letters or tracks),
agree on her refusals (food, talk). We file under *Violence & Secret Life* for the shaved head
and the tool that hushes speech, cross-listed to *Mediation & Aperture* for the way she tunes a wheel
like a window—letting force through, not bodies. The contradictions are the sighting.

catalog_code: "E1"
excerpt: "The singers carry two ledgers at once: melody for the square, confession for the alley. Many of the North songs turn on a small instrument—knife, creek, borrowed name."
---

**Catalog Code:** E1

## Provenance

Lane-collector spools from the North road (wax & aluminum, mixed quality); stool-transcripts from taverns
between Gee Road and the Quarry line; two parish songbooks (loose-leaf, weather damage). Compiled by the
North Desk, with cross-notes to the Northo "Lives" folio and three depositions referencing the mapmaker's cart.

## Extract

> "Singers show up, come from North Town more than any other borough. Why? Murder songs."
> 
> "The principle of North Town is living a secret life — serial killer only being one of the more obvious variety."

## Index — First Lines & Recording Notes

| First Line (as sung) | Locale | Source | Notes |
|---------------------|--------|--------|-------|
| *I washed my hands in the creek named After* | North road tavern, mile 11 | wax cylinder (late) | Voice doubled at refrain; second singer off-mic, suspected "pairing" echo |
| *He borrowed my name for a Sunday* | Schoolhouse porch, Old Gee Spur | aluminum disc | Child descant on verse 3; parish book lacks this stanza |
| *Bring me the knife with the churchyard handle* | Market lane, North Town proper | stool transcript | Witness swears singer smiled only on the word *handle* |
| *We took the road that won't be seen* | Bridge by the mill, dusk | wax cylinder (damaged) | Low mechanical hum underneath; mapmaker's cart reported upriver that night |
| *Mother sewed my shadow shut* | North gate steps | parish notebook | Margin hand: "*missionary is the killer*" (ink-blot, uncertain hand) |

## Archivist's Commentary

The singers carry two ledgers at once: melody for the square, confession for the alley. Many of the
North songs turn on a small instrument—knife, creek, borrowed name—then open a second life under the first,
where the "missionary" voice courts and conceals. Our task is not to decide who kills, only to preserve
the split. We file doubled takes beside clean ones, and keep the hums, because the hum is how the road
remembers who passed over it.

region: "Northo"
catalog_code: "E2"
excerpt: "The witnesses look for a single hand to carry the weight: the man, the women, the objects. The cart answers by moving anyway."
---

**Catalog Code:** E2

## Provenance

Axle repair entry from the village ledger (night watch signature smudged); tavern-boy's notes
recorded by the reeve; corroborating remarks from two men who shadowed the road toward Gee.

## Extract

> A man arrived with a cart not quite larger than a wheelbarrow yet opening inside into rooms upon rooms.
> Five women walked behind it as if roped though they were not. He slept a day and a night while they
> watched him. At dawn, with the new axle fitted, he pulled west again. No one could agree on what made
> the cart so heavy, only that the man refused others' food and the women refused his.

## Archivist's Commentary

The witnesses look for a single hand to carry the weight: the man, the women, the objects. The cart
answers by moving anyway. It drags its own world forward and speaks only in what it unfolds—rooms,
habits, distances—never in confession. We file intention last here. The burden is its own author;
the testimony is the only map we can draw.
