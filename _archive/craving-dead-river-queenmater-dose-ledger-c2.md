**Catalog Code:** C2

## Provenance

Dead River · Street-circulated **Queenmater** “cheat” sheets; domestic witness to the **Dead River Whores** franchise (comic → TV); town speech motto logged at the limits.

## Extract

> || This thing will never be resolved. These handouts keep getting circulated all over town. I don’t know who this “Queenmater” person is. ||

> || Queenmater Handouts -- Seven Ways of Words, Seven Forms of the Craving ||

> || Dead River Whores was a TV show Cora’s son unfortunately watched all the time. Five episodes in a day if she let him. It had been a comic before someone made it a show, and now Evan was buying up old volumes and leaving them around where Yoyo, who was only ten, could see those awful covers, each with an almost naked woman dead in some ghastly way. ||

> || Someone heard it was going to be an album… He thought it could be a game. It might be. A game about Dead River. ||

> || Only bad things happen for a reason. Good things? Who knows and who cares. ||

## Archivist’s Commentary

Filed **Craving** (primary). The handout walks the streets naming **forms of craving**; the category becomes a **meter** people carry, not a gloss. The franchise regularizes a **dose** (“five episodes in a day”) and trains a **gaze** (covers as lesson), so appetite arrives with a schedule and a look. The motto supplies a counting rule—**causality is reserved for harm**—which tilts attention toward injuries and away from gifts; it’s a speech-device that tallies desire by what goes wrong. Cross-index (light): **Violence & Secret Life** (harm laundered as after-school time); **Mediation & Aperture** (formats—handout, panel, episode—function as apertures routing appetite). Region marks provenance (Dead River), but the mechanism—**how craving learns its beat**—is the reason for the file.
