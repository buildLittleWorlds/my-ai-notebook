## Extract

> **Card 1 (ditch marker 7):** || Woman with shaved head, leather apron. Turned a bone wheel by hand; said it would "catch" if we spoke. ||
> 
> **Card 2 (stall behind the mill):** || Lines on scalp like letters or tracks. Paid for a cog with a ring from a child's toy. Refused stew; asked for wire. ||
> 
> **Card 3 (tavern stool, Densmok):** || "She's the one pulled the mapmaker out of the gutter once. Fed him leathery stew. Told him Dens spits out saints by accident." ||

## Archivist's Commentary

She arrives as a mechanic and leaves as a rumor. The cards disagree on her marks (letters or tracks),
agree on her refusals (food, talk). We file under *Violence & Secret Life* for the shaved head
and the tool that hushes speech, cross-listed to *Mediation & Aperture* for the way she tunes a wheel
like a window—letting force through, not bodies. The contradictions are the sighting.
