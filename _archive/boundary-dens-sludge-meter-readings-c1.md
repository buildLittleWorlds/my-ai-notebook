## Provenance

West Ditch Survey, field staff *R-5* through *R-7*; monthly stick-depth and pan-grit captures.
Auxiliary transcripts from tavern stools on the western road (compiled by lane-runners).
Labels standardized by South Arcade Registrar's office (Year 20, Q1).

## Extract — Boundary Accounts

> In one account: Dens is "a regular town… on the edge of the western wilderness."
> In the other: "the wilderness… always in danger of sinking [the town] further into it,"
> with grit "heaping… by the day" until "the one will be indistinguishable from the other."

## Archivist's Commentary

The staff reads what the mouths say. Our sticks rise with the stories of swallowing,
fall with the stories of safe streets. The boundary does not stay put: it moves with the hour,
the season, the ditching. We file these numbers beside the stool transcripts, not to reconcile
them, but to keep the circle whole: town and wilderness reading through each other. When a porch
line vanishes overnight, we note it the way we note a new proverb—evidence of where the edge went
while no one was watching.
