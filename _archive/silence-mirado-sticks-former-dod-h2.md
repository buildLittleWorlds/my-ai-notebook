**Catalog Code:** H2

## Provenance

Sticks · Web-archive export of a local forum ("Mirado Clinic board," Y22–Y23),
matched against router logs kept by a clinic aide; addendum from a volunteer moderator's
"quiet-hours" notebook (no-screens mornings).

## Extract

> **Router Sheet (02:13–02:27):** Spike on /queenmater thread; referrers: *former.io* mirror;
> *def.mil* crawler family seen in header. Three logins after midnight, two from alley Wi-Fi repeater. "E." removes embeds; thread switches to plain text.
> 
> **Forum Capture (mod screenshot, 02:31):** User *former_guest*: "We archive because the Sticks delete. Your 'withdrawals' prove the Tower model." Reply (clinic aide): "We don't 'delete'; we put speech after hands. Come back during quiet hours."
> 
> **Quiet-Hours Note (margin):** "Traffic is attention-shaped. When the crawler comes, the voices speed up, then stall. We re-mark silence at dawn and start loops again."

## Archivist's Commentary

The Sticks treat silence as a method, not a void: many returns begin with a broken screen and end in hand-work.
The forum shows how surveillance reorders tempo—posts accelerate at the glance of the crawler, then the
off-switch restores the local grammar where words go last and hands go first. We shelve this under
*Silence & Withdrawal*. (Cross-ref: Sticks withdrawal logs for Cassie, E., Ria.)
