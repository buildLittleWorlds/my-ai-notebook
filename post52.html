            <h2>52 The Baker Analogy</h2>
            <p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOrVyuH8mMs&t=613s">"A Bit of a Rant About Generative AI for Writing and Learning."</a> The guy starts with an analogy. If I tell a baker how to make a cake, I'm not the baker. The baker is. So if I tell an AI to write a story, the AI writes the story. I'm not the writer. And if you fix the output, you're editing. "Editing is not writing."</p>
            
            <p>It's a clean image. But it's defending the <a href="post54.html">Romantic ideal of the author</a> as a solitary creator. The whole rant depends on it.</p>

            <h3>Who's the author?</h3>
            <p>The main argument is "it is doing the writing, not us." He treats writing as the physical act of putting the first draft on the page. By this logic, a person with a ghostwritten book isn't the author. A director in a writers' room isn't the author of the play. Obviously not how authorship works. It's about conceptual control, not who types.</p>
            
            <p>The real problem is the rant needs a singular source. Same worldview from Whitman's <a href="post25.html">"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,"</a> where an author has to be a single presence who "pours my meaning into you." A distributed process breaks this model. The guy's defending the author's soul, not their work.</p>

            <h3>Editing as writing</h3>
            <p>The other claim: "editing is not writing." This only works if you think a text has to spring fully formed from one vision. Literary history disagrees. Ezra Pound's work on *The Waste Land* was composition. He changed its whole architecture. Dismissing this protects the myth of the solitary genius.</p>
            
            <p>AI-assisted work is mostly rewriting. You throw out huge chunks of the first output, add your own stuff, rearrange everything. The AI supplies raw material. The human shapes it into something coherent. Saying this isn't writing is defending <a href="post9.html">sincerity</a>. The work isn't authentic because the author didn't suffer for every word of the first draft.</p>

            <h3>The struggle thing</h3>
            <p>The rant warns using AI is "cognitive offloading" and "we're not developing" our skills. Same argument from the pastor in <a href="post26.html">Post 26</a>: "We learn from the struggle." Bypassing the painful process is a moral failure, not a technical shortcut. The product's inauthentic because it wasn't born of suffering.</p>
            
            <p>But this is a choice about method. Not a law. The fear calculators would atrophy math skills was real. Didn't happen. We offloaded the tedious part to focus on higher problems. Using AI to get past the blank page isn't "outsourcing thought." It's outsourcing the first draft so you can get to the real work of shaping.</p>

            <h3>A different analogy</h3>
            <p>The baker analogy doesn't work. Try the musician and the synthesizer. A synth generates sound on its own. We don't call it a song until a musician shapes it into a composition. No one says the synthesizer is the composer. The musician is. The AI is an instrument. Its output is noise until a writer gives it form.</p>
            
            <p>The guy's defending a model of the writer already becoming a historical artifact. Writing has always been more than generating sentences. It's orchestrating ideas. The rant's afraid the baker is being replaced. Maybe we're learning to play a new instrument.</p>
