            <h2>52 Ugh</h2>
            <p>I just watched Philip Nel's "How to resist the lure of AI." And ugh. Not because it's bad. It's the opposite. It's a sincere, passionate, and incredibly articulate defense of a certain way of seeing the world. It's so good at what it does that it feels like a final boss for this notebook. It's the perfect, complete statement of the thing I've been calling the <a href="post21.html">"Romantic trace."</a></p>

            <p>Nel's whole argument is a masterclass in the worldview I sketched out in <a href="post9.html">"Romantic Evil."</a> He gives nine reasons to resist AI, and every single one is a defense of the authentic, struggling, human soul against the machine. It's all here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inauthenticity:</strong> He contrasts the student's "distinct voice" with AI's "cheerful advertising copywriter" style. He wants the real you, not a simulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Instrumentalism:</strong> He calls AI a "plagiarism machine" built on the "theft of others work." It treats human creativity as a raw resource to be strip-mined.</li>
                <li><strong>Profaned Communion:</strong> His promise not to use AI to grade is the core of it. To do so would be to "outsource my job to a robot," to profane the sacred, personal exchange between teacher and student. It’s the pastor refusing to use a machine for a sermon because <a href="post26.html">"there's no one there."</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>He argues that "writing is a form of thinking," and that outsourcing thinking makes us dumber. He says he wants to see our "humanity," even if it's not "grammatically perfect." This is the Romantic ideal in its purest form. He's Walt Whitman on the Brooklyn Ferry, promising to be the living, breathing person on the other end of the educational line, pouring his authentic meaning into us. It’s a powerful and deeply moving vision of what education should be.</p>

            <p>And I don't buy it.</p>
            
            <p>The problem is that the entire argument is built on a foundation this blog has been questioning from the start. Nel’s critique is a moral one, aimed at AI’s lack of a soul, its inability to think or feel. But what if "thinking," at least the part that involves language, isn't what we think it is? What if it's not the expression of a unified inner self, but the operation of an impersonal system?</p>

            <p>Nel says AI just "performs statistical pattern matching." Elan Barenholtz, the computational guy I've been reading, would say, "Exactly. And so do you." At least, the language part of you does. From this view, what Nel calls the "humanity" in writing is the result of a <a href="post43.html">"dance of symbols,"</a> an "autonomous informational system" that got <a href="post36.html">"downloaded against your will."</a></p>

            <p>This is the deep irony of the video. Nel delivers a passionate defense of the un-standardized, Socratic, human element of education while operating within the ultimate machine of standardization: the modern university. As I wrote in <a href="post29.html">"No wince in the syllabus,"</a> the university system has been working for a long time to rationalize education, to turn it into a technique for producing a predictable result. AI isn't the alien invader coming to destroy the humanistic university; it's the logical fulfillment of the university we’ve already built.</p>
            
            <p>In the end, Nel's video is a beautiful and heartfelt defense of what now survives only as a trace. He's guarding a sacred space—the authentic, human-to-human connection—that the technical systems we all live inside of have been systematically dismantling for centuries. The reason AI feels so threatening to this worldview is that it's the first time we've had a language machine where we can't even pretend there's a person on the other end. It strips away the illusion. It makes us confront the possibility that when it comes to language, maybe there never was a distinct presence in the language system to begin with, only patterned traces.</p>
