    <h1>AI Text Forensics</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">How to read machine-written text like a forensic linguist.</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <p><strong>What this is:</strong> A practical guide to identifying the likely presence of AI in a text and to reading it well if it is.</p>
      <p><strong>What this is not:</strong> A magical detector. There is no single test that proves a text was written by AI. This is a method for weighing evidence.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why Forensics?</h2>
    <p>Interpretation starts with the artifact. Think of this like Lorenzo Valla analyzing the <em>Donation of Constantine</em>: he didn’t ask what people believed; he examined the Latin. You’re doing the same, studying style, syntax, structure, and sources.</p>

    <h2>The Four Forensic Dimensions</h2>

    <h3>1. Grammatical Analysis: The System's Fingerprints</h3>
    <p>Every AI model has characteristic patterns that function like linguistic fingerprints.</p>

    <h4>What to Look For:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Formulaic Transitions:</strong> "Furthermore,"...In conclusion," transitional phrases that appear with unnatural frequency</li>
      <li><strong>Hedge Language:</strong> "It seems," "appears to be," "might suggest." Statistical uncertainty made linguistic</li>
      <li><strong>List Structures:</strong> Artificial preference for numbered lists and bullet points</li>
      <li><strong>Semantic Drift:</strong> Gradual topic changes that follow associational rather than logical patterns</li>
      <li><strong>Register Inconsistency:</strong> Mixing formal academic language with casual expressions</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Methods:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Look for repetition patterns in phrasing, especially near paragraph boundaries</li>
      <li>Scan for “thesaurus spirals”: rare synonyms used inconsistently</li>
      <li>Check punctuation habits: em dashes vs commas vs semicolons</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Training Data Archaeology: Tracing the Sources</h3>
    <p>AI texts reflect statistical patterns from their training data (and may sometimes memorize or regurgitate snippets). Like archaeological layers, you can sometimes identify the strata.</p>

    <h4>What to Look For:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Temporal Anachronism:</strong> Sources implicitly from different eras mashed together</li>
      <li><strong>Genre Blending:</strong> Academic diction with pop journalism cadence</li>
      <li><strong>Canonical Gravity:</strong> Over-reliance on “obvious” examples and quotations</li>
      <li><strong>Surface Paraphrase:</strong> Rephrasings that preserve order and emphasis of a likely source</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Methods:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Extract distinctive phrases (5–8 words) and search for near-matches</li>
      <li>Map references: which authors/titles recur, and how are they combined?</li>
      <li>Compare metaphors: do images feel generic or oddly mixed?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Logical Profile: How the Text Moves</h3>
    <p>AI writing often follows probabilistic transitions rather than argumentative necessity.</p>

    <h4>What to Look For:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Centerless Summaries:</strong> Everything is relevant; nothing is decisive</li>
      <li><strong>Over-symmetric Structure:</strong> 3–5 tidy sections with parallel subpoints regardless of topic</li>
      <li><strong>Confidence + Vagueness:</strong> Authoritative tone with low-commitment claims</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Methods:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Outline the argument—does each step necessitate the next, or just plausibly follow?</li>
      <li>Check citations: are they integral to claims or ornament on the surface?</li>
      <li>Test for “rubber logic”: replace key terms—does the paragraph still read plausibly?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Signature Artifacts: Known Model Behaviors</h3>
    <p>Some behaviors are widely documented in contemporary LLMs.</p>

    <h4>What to Look For:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Repetition/Bluntness:</strong> looping phrases, bland generalities</li>
      <li><strong>Over-structure:</strong> boilerplate intros/outros; stock “takeaways” sections</li>
      <li><strong>Context Loss:</strong> difficulty retrieving mid-document details in long contexts</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Methods:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Probe with specific follow-ups (“where did X come from?”). Look for confident mistakes</li>
      <li>Move key details to the middle of a long prompt to test retrieval degradation</li>
      <li>Ask for a rephrase in a constrained style to expose training-pattern defaults</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Worked Example</h2>
    <p>Consider this AI-generated sonnet line: "The autumn leaves doth whisper secrets old." Forensic analysis reveals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grammatical:</strong> Archaic "doth" with modern "whisper"—a blend many contemporary poets would avoid unless intentionally anachronistic</li>
      <li><strong>Archaeological:</strong> Combines Shakespearean sonnet patterns with Romantic nature imagery</li>
      <li><strong>Logical:</strong> Follows statistical patterns... of "poetic" language without deeper metaphorical coherence</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Decision Framework: Weighing Evidence</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Collect signals</strong> across the four dimensions</li>
      <li><strong>Assign weights</strong> based on strength and independence of each signal</li>
      <li><strong>Form a judgment</strong> about likelihood of AI authorship—not a proof, a probability</li>
      <li><strong>Adapt your reading</strong> accordingly (see below)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Read AI Texts Better</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interrogate claims</strong>—require concrete references, not just authority tone</li>
      <li><strong>Track metaphors</strong>—note when imagery is generic or mixed</li>
      <li><strong>Force commitments</strong>—ask for choices and tradeoffs, not just summaries</li>
      <li><strong>Re-anchor</strong>—tie assertions to sources and inspect those sources</li>
    </ul>
