           <h2>45 Heroes and Parades</h2>
           <p>I'm going to write a series of posts about the music video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg">"Hero"</a> by Family of the Year. I'm going to push out the length of these. I want to work the ideas a bit harder.</p>
           
           <p>The first time I heard the song, it seemed pretty obvious it's a kind of anthem against the idea of heroes. The lyrics are a personal opt-out of any grand ideas: "I don't want to be your hero / I don't want to be a big man." But the video's different. It follows the life of a rodeo cowboy, and it's a more complicated story and also pretty familiar. The song isn't a critique of the hero. It's an example of this <a href="post21.html">Romantic trace</a> I've been commenting on. It rejects one kind of hero in favor of another.</p>
           
           <p>The song is skeptical. But it's not attacking everything to do with heroes. It's targeting the part of being a hero that's tied to public performance. The "hey, look at me" variety of the hero. The lines, "Your masquerade / I don't want to be a part of your parade," are basically a Romantic allergy to inauthenticity. This is related to the critique I've labeled <a href="post9.html">"Romantic Evil"</a>: the empty forms, the "mechanical repetitions," and the "profaned communion" of public spectacles. The video defines this "parade" as the rodeo itself. The cheering crowds, the larger-than-life persona. The singer (maybe speaking for the cowboy?) doesn't want any part of the hollow performance. He's rejecting the costuming.</p>

           <p>But ok, so what does the video want instead? It keeps showing us the cowboy's actual life. Him getting thrown around by bulls. Being exhausted. His day job at a meat market. This is the thing about the Romantic worldview. The struggle itself is supposed to mean something. The pastor in <a href="post26.html">Post 26</a> said "We learn from the struggle." That's what's happening here. The cowboy's not a hero because he wins in the arena. It's the painful, unglamorous work that proves he's real.</p>
           
           <p>And then there's what he's doing it for. Not glory. The quiet scenes with his daughter. Sharing ice cream. Carrying her on his shoulders. This is the stuff the rodeo performance can't give you. The <a href="post13.html">Romantic conscience</a> wants this over everything else, the private connection that's actually real. So the hero isn't the guy conquering the bull for the crowd. It's the father who goes through the danger because he's got a kid to provide for.</p>
           
           <p>The song's not anti-hero. It's choosing one kind of hero over another. The internal family man doing his thing, not the external "big man" performance. It's the Romantic idea about authentic struggle mattering more than appearances.</p>
