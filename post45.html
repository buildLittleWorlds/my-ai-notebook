            <h2>45 Heroes and parades</h2>
            <p>I've been thinking about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg">music video for the song "Hero" by Family of the Year</a>. At first glance, it seems like an anthem against the idea of heroism. The lyrics are a refusal of the title: "I don't wanna be your hero / I don't wanna be a big man." But when you watch the video, which follows the life of a rodeo cowboy, a more complicated and familiar story emerges. The song is not a critique of the heroic, but an expression of the <a href="post21.html">Romantic trace</a> that runs through this notebook. It rejects one kind of hero to champion another.</p>
            
            <p>The song's skepticism is aimed squarely at the public performance of greatness. The lines, "Your masquerade / I don't wanna be a part of your parade," are an articulation of the Romantic aversion to inauthenticity. This is a critique of what I've called <a href="post9.html">"Romantic Evil"</a>: the empty forms, the "mechanical repetition," and the "profaned communion" of a public spectacle. The video visually defines this "parade" as the rodeo itself. The cheering crowds, the larger-than-life persona, the high drama. The singer, speaking for the cowboy, wants no part of this hollow performance. He is rejecting the costume of the hero.</p>

            <p>But in place of this public "parade," the song and video elevate a different set of values that <em>are</em> Romantic. The video shows us the cowboy's reality: the brutal, dangerous work of bull riding, the exhaustion, and the menial labor of his day job at a meat market. This is the moral center of the piece: the idea that meaning is authenticated by sincere personal struggle. As the pastor in <a href="post26.html">Post 26</a> argued, "We learn from the struggle." The cowboy's heroism is not located in his victories in the arena but in the painful, unglamorous work he undertakes. The grit is the proof of his integrity.</p>
            
            <p>And what is this struggle for? Not for glory but for a different kind of communion. The most affecting scenes are the quiet ones: his return home to his small daughter, the sharing of an ice cream cone, carrying her on his shoulders. This is the "living speech" that the "empty forms" of the rodeo lack. This is the sincere, private, and authentic connection that the Romantic conscience prizes above other stuff. The hero isn't the man who conquers the bull for the crowd but the father who endures that danger to provide for his child.</p>
            
            <p>So, the song is not anti-heroic. It's a redefinition of the heroic. It dismisses the external, performative "big man" in favor of the internal, sincere family man. It takes the core Romantic value—sincerity—and argues that it is found not in the parade, but in the quiet, often painful, reality of a life lived for others. It is a powerful modern statement of the old Romantic faith that true worth lies not in what you appear to be, but in the authentic struggle of your soul.</p>
