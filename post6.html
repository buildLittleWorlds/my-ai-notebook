                <p>"I'm listening to myself talk right now. Who's actually forming these words? They're coming from somewhere... the me that feels the warmth of the sun on my face... isn't the same me that is actually talking about it."</p>

            <p><em>— Dr. Elan Barenholtz, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIMw04GJJ7U&t=1059s">The Auto-Regression Theory of Cognition</a></em> (14:15 in video)</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"Man, emptied by the technical mechanism of all personal interests, sometimes finds himself at home. What shall he talk about? Man has always had one unfailing subject of conversation, life’s vexations... Now technique intervenes, repairs everything, and creates a world in which everything works well... the individual feels no need to speak of them and turns toward the efficient silence-fillers, television and radio."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><em>— Jacques Ellul, The Technological Society</em> (p. 378)</p>
            
            <p>I've been watching videos of this guy, Elan Barenholtz. Here he's describing the split he's theorized between the feeling, experiencing, grounded-in-the-world self and the speaking self. Barenholtz thinks our language, our speaking and thinking in language, is its own system of some kind living and functioning in each of us. Pretty much like an live-in language model speaking and thinking for us.</p>
                
            <p>Ellul describes a sociological split between the lived self and a technicized world that silences authentic experience. Is Ellul describing the same thing Barenholtz thinks we now have proof of?</p>

            <p>There's a kind of feedback loop here. Ellul's technicized world makes us feel empty and bored, so we turn on the TV. That "silence-filler" then becomes the data stream that feeds the "speaking self" Barenholtz is talking about. It's like the system creates the problem and then sells us a solution that makes the problem permanent.</p>

            <p>So the ghost isn't just a part of us, it's the part that's been colonized by the machine. The 'speaking self' talks in the language of the technical world because that's all it consumes. The 'feeling self' just sits there, watching the show.</p>
