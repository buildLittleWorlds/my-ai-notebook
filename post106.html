      <h2>106 Carving the Minor: Deleuze’s Lines of Flight</h2>

      <p>Last post I sketched Hegel’s wager. Enter the mass deeply enough and the alien wiring begins to show itself as an intelligible circuit. Today the counterpoint. Deleuze does not resolve the mass into clarity. He leaves it tangled. His strategy is to find or make little spaces inside it, what he calls lines of flight. Not incorporation, but deviation.</p>

      <h3>Minor Literature as Strategy</h3>
      <p>In <em>Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature</em>, Deleuze and Guattari ask how one can live in a language not one’s own. Kafka’s answer is to destabilize it, make it stutter:</p>

      <blockquote>
        “How many people today live in a language that is not their own? […] How to become a nomad and an immigrant and a gypsy in relation to one’s own language? Kafka answers: steal the baby from its crib, walk the tight rope.” (Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1986, p. 19)
      </blockquote>

      <p>This is the image of the minor. Not the deep integration of the Hegelian citizen but the fragile invention of life on a tight rope, inside the tangled wiring of the system but manipulating or outright clearing its threads until something else emerges.</p>

      <h3>Difference Without Reconciliation</h3>
      <p>The metaphysical ground for this comes from Deleuze’s <em>Difference and Repetition</em>. There he insists difference is not derivative of identity. It does not resolve into synthesis. It is generative in itself:</p>

      <blockquote>
        “Repetition thus appears as difference without a concept, repetition which escapes indefinitely continued conceptual difference. It expresses a power peculiar to the existent, a stubbornness of the existent in intuition, which resists every specification by concepts.” (Deleuze, 1968, p. 13)
      </blockquote>

      <p>That refusal of reconciliation is the point. For Deleuze, the mass does not become transparent through understanding. It remains a mass of knots, uneven and unpredictable. Freedom comes from moving through the gaps, weaving new strands, improvising connections that never tighten into a single design.</p>

      <h3>Lines of Flight vs. Deep Opt-In</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hegel:</strong> dissolve alienation by entering so fully the tangle becomes intelligible, even livable.</li>
        <li><strong>Deleuze:</strong> keep the tangle tangled; carve lines of flight where invention can persist without reconciliation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For me, that makes the Deleuzian strategy not a retreat but a discipline. Seek out the stutter, the deviation, the little archipelago inside the wiring where life can keep moving. No beautiful soul here. No deep incorporation either. Just the inventive persistence of the minor.</p>
