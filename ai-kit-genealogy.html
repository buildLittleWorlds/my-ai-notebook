    <h1>Genealogy of Interpreters (Historical Perspectives on AI Texts)</h1>

    <p>How would the great hermeneutical thinkers respond to ChatGPT? This genealogy traces fifteen key figures to show how different interpretive traditions handle the challenge of authorless texts. Each approach reveals different aspects of what it means to make meaning from algorithmic discourse.</p>

    <h2>The Traditionalists: Those Who Need Authors</h2>
    <p>These thinkers built their hermeneutics around reconstructing human consciousness. AI texts present them with an insurmountable problem.</p>

    <h3>Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834): The "Father of Modern Hermeneutics"</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Method:</strong> Reconstruct the author's unique creative act through "grammatical" and "psychological" interpretation</li>
      <li><strong>AI Response:</strong> Profound dilemma—the psychological rail becomes impossible</li>
      <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> AI texts are hermeneutically incomplete; any "psychological" reading would be self-deception</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911): Life-Expression and Understanding</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Method:</strong> Understanding as re-experiencing the "life-expression" (Lebensäußerung) behind texts</li>
      <li><strong>AI Response:</strong> Genuine rupture—AI texts are "lifeless" and therefore not proper objects for understanding</li>
      <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> AI texts belong to the natural sciences (explanation) not the human sciences (understanding)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Emilio Betti (1890-1968): Objective Recovery of Authorial Will</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Method:</strong> Methodical recovery of the author's intended meaning as an objective standard</li>
      <li><strong>AI Response:</strong> Nightmare scenario—without authorial intent, interpretation becomes subjective projection</li>
      <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> AI texts are "pseudo-texts" that cannot be legitimately interpreted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Bridge-Builders: Those Who Adapt</h2>
    <p>These thinkers already questioned pure authorial control, making them more flexible when faced with authorless texts.</p>

    <h3>Augustine (354-430): The Rule of Charity</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Method:</strong> Seek the author's intent, but accept unintended meanings if they promote love and truth</li>
      <li><strong>AI Response:</strong> Pragmatic adaptation—judge interpretations by their ethical fruits, not their source</li>
      <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> AI texts can be interpreted if the reading serves the "rule of charity"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002): Fusion of Horizons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Method:</strong> Understanding as dialogue between the interpreter's horizon and the text's historical horizon</li>
      <li><strong>AI Response:</strong> Resilient continuity—can dialogue with the tradition embedded in AI training data</li>
      <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> AI texts remain interpretable, though the dialogue may be "thinner"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Paul Ricoeur (1913-2005): Semantic Autonomy and Distanciation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Method:</strong> Texts gain independence from authors through writing; focus on "the world of the text"</li>
      <li><strong>AI Response:</strong> Affirmation—AI texts represent extreme distanciation, reinforcing textual autonomy</li>
      <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> AI texts pose a "new state of the hermeneutic task" but remain fully interpretable</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Deconstructors: Those Who Celebrate Authorlessness</h2>
    <p>These thinkers already dismantled the author, making AI texts a vindication of their approach.</p>

    <h3>Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900): Will to Power in Interpretation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Method:</strong> "There are no facts, only interpretations"—meaning is imposed by the interpreter's will to power</li>
      <li><strong>AI Response:</strong> Liberation—"Who cares who the author is?" The absence of intention frees interpretation</li>
      <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> AI texts prove what was always true: interpretation is creative imposition, not recovery</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Martin Heidegger (1889-1976): Language as the House of Being</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Method:</strong> Understanding as an ontological condition; "language speaks" beyond individual intention</li>
      <li><strong>AI Response:</strong> Critical diagnosis—AI texts are "idle talk" (Gerede), symptoms of technological "enframing"</li>
      <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> Interpret the phenomenon of AI texts to understand our technological condition</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Jacques Derrida (1930-2004): Iterability and the Play of Signifiers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Method:</strong> Meaning emerges from the endless play of language, not from authorial presence</li>
      <li><strong>AI Response:</strong> Ultimate vindication—AI texts prove language functions "in the radical absence" of a sender</li>
      <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> AI texts are perfect demonstrations of how writing always worked</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Forensic Investigators: Those Who Trace Origins</h2>
    <p>These thinkers focus on textual authenticity and historical context.</p>

    <h3>Lorenzo Valla (1407-1457): Philological Forensics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Method:</strong> Expose forgeries through linguistic and historical analysis</li>
      <li><strong>AI Response:</strong> Treat as "forgery by no one"—subject to philological dissection</li>
      <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> AI texts are pastiches to be deconstructed into their source components</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>August Böckh (1785-1867): The Knowledge of the Known</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Method:</strong> Philology as recovery of what humans have already known</li>
      <li><strong>AI Response:</strong> Critical adaptation—analyze as composite works requiring source criticism</li>
      <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> AI texts are derivative artifacts requiring "philological dissection"</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Pattern That Emerges</h2>
    <p>This genealogy reveals a fundamental split in hermeneutical traditions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Author-Centric Hermeneutics:</strong> Faces genuine crisis with AI texts</li>
      <li><strong>Text-Centric Hermeneutics:</strong> Adapts more easily to authorless discourse</li>
      <li><strong>Reader-Centric Hermeneutics:</strong> Finds vindication in AI's pure textuality</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AI texts force hermeneutics to choose its fundamental ground: Is meaning recovery or creation? Is the author essential or dispensable? These questions, debated for centuries, now have empirical test cases in every ChatGPT output.</p>
