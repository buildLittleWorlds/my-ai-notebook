# Colloquy Note 18.9 — On the Fivefold Silhouette Copies

**Session:** Informal Colloquy, South Arcade Chamber
**Recorder:** Archivist L. Corvell
**Date:** Year 18
**Status:** Not Adopted (filed as discussion note)

---

## Abstract

Witnesses from Dead River and Castelia bring slips describing **silhouette impressions** that multiply in fivefold iterations. The difficulty: there is no “original” to which they can be returned. Provenance-first filing fails, as there is nothing to pin to geography alone. This note introduces the proposed Order of **Doubling** as a necessary classification.

## Exhibits

### Clip A — Dead River Account

|| “We traced her outline in the mud. A week later, five more outlines appeared beside it, none drawn by hand.” ||
Filed: *Dead River · Outlaw Diary*

### Clip B — Castelia Account

|| “They showed me five figures, each with the same cut of hem. They swore each was the copy. When I asked for the first, they laughed.” ||
Filed: *Castelia · Witness Report*

### Clip C — Clerk’s Annotation

|| “It is not imitation, it is multiplication. To ask ‘which is first’ is to misunderstand the slip.” ||
Filed: *Capital · Annotation Margin (unsigned)*

## Findings

1. **No Primary Reference.**
   Regional filing presumes an “original” tied to a place. These silhouettes have no such anchor.

2. **Recurrence as Evidence.**
   The fact of multiplication — fivefold in Dead River, fivefold in Castelia — is the content. Provenance is secondary.

3. **Doubling ≠ Counterfeit.**
   It is not a matter of fake vs. authentic. All five claim authenticity, and no test discriminates. The proper category is not “Forgery” but “Doubling.”

## Irritation with Prior Doctrine

Minute 3.7 told us that “place endures.” But here place does not endure; it is irrelevant. The slips would replicate in any soil. To file by geography alone is to hide the phenomenon.

---

## Proposed Filing

> **Order:** Doubling
> **Region:** Dead River; Castelia
> **Form:** Witness Account

---

## Disposition

Senior archivists thanked the colloquy and refiled both slips under *Dead River* and *Castelia*. The proposal for “Doubling” was marked *theoretical* and tabled.

Margin note: *“Multiplicity is a trick of the eye. Keep them in their boroughs.”*

## Closing Reflection

If the Archive cannot admit multiplication without origin, then the Archive lies. We may pretend to serve custody, but we will have filed the world’s most dangerous evidence under the bland mark of “region.”
