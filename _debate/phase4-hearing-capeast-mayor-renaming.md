## Abstract
Question before the clerk: whether to **rename Alton as Capeast** in the Archive. Steel is gone; the town’s self-description and **device-logic** have changed. We apply Orders-first standards: if an **aperture** becomes the principal classifier of civic life, Region must follow it. Recommend **referral** to standards with aliasing instructions.

## Exhibits

**Exhibit A — Policy impetus (Capeast file)**
|| Rewrite Alton to be Capeast -- Alton shifts southeast to be east of the Cap; build up Capeast as two things: the worn-out tech borough (old tech is the equivalent of steel) and the beginning creation of Densworld as a resistance to the Cap ||
*Commentary (Clerkly):* This is the rename request in plain terms. It reframes provenance (Alton) by function (**worn-out tech** as the new ground) and by institutional posture (resistance to the Cap). Primary Order flags: **Mediation & Aperture** (device-led identity), with **Boundary** (movement of the civic edge).

**Exhibit B — The Mayor’s aperture (Capeast file)**
|| Capeast is a town that was a steel town along the Mississippi… Now, with the steel gone, Lewis Bramford paced the Town Hall steps into early mornings… and dreamed… of a river that brought from its spring in Minnesota recycled seconds… ||
*Commentary (Clerkly):* The **dream-ledger** functions as an **aperture**. It regularizes a new flow (time-commodities), which then governs practice and record. Device first; place second.

**Exhibit C — Municipal cipher (Alton file; supporting)**
|| Semple St. … so overhung… the chief officer of public works has notation in his personal town map showing the street to be a **cipher**. There was a woman named S N who lived on Semple St. ||
*Commentary (Clerkly):* Even at the street scale, the town works through **codes** and sight-lines. This supports device-led classification when evaluating name change.

## Main Content / Argument
1) **Standard applied.** Under Orders-first, **Mediation & Aperture** is primary when a device (window, cart, street-cipher, dream-ledger) determines what can be known or filed. **Boundary** is co-equal where the edge itself moves.

2) **Trigger for rename.** Rename a Region when: (a) the prior industrial or civic substrate **collapses**; (b) a new **aperture** emerges that sets the ledger for practice and record; (c) municipal speech and habit adopt the device as norm (mayor’s nightly pacing + dream-ledger). All three are present.

3) **Risk & remedy.** Risk: continuity loss for historic “Alton” slips. Remedy: institute an **alias ledger**: mark “Alton (alias)” on prior regional labels; primary Region becomes **Capeast** going forward. Cross-index by both **Order** and **alias Region** for all backfiled items.

4) **Operational notes.** Backfile tasks: (i) tag legacy “Alton” slips with **Capeast** as Region (secondary) while preserving the printed Alton label; (ii) add an Editorial Note to the hub explaining the rename and the aperture rationale; (iii) add a standing link from “Alton” finder results to **Capeast**.

## Disposition
**Referred** — to Standards Subcommittee on Renaming (Orders-first). Clerk requests a draft directive enumerating the (a)–(c) trigger and **alias ledger** procedure.
