## Abstract
Do our labels feed the world they file? In **Dead River**, three circulating devices—**cheat handouts**, a **TV/comic franchise**, and a fatalist **motto**—show feedback between catalog and practice. This hearing logs how **Craving** is taught and tallied, how **Violence & Secret Life** is laundered as entertainment, and how **devices** (handouts, episodes, covers) **mediate** appetite.

## Exhibits

### Clip (H1) — The handouts: “Seven Ways of Words, Seven Forms of the Craving”
`|| This thing will never be resolved. These handouts keep getting circulated all over town. I don’t know who this “Queenmater” person is. ||`  
`|| Queenmater Handouts -- Seven Ways of Words, Seven Forms of the Craving ||`  
*Filed:* Dead River · Street circulation

**Commentary (Romantic):** A syllabus with no schoolmaster. The sheet names **Craving** and multiplies its **forms**; the category walks the streets, teaching.

---

### Clip (H2) — The franchise: Dead River Whores (comic → show)
`|| Dead River Whores was a TV show Cora’s son unfortunately watched all the time. Five episodes in a day if she let him. It had been a comic before someone made it a show… Yoyo, who was only ten, asked why a dog would eat such a pretty woman’s head… ||`  
*Filed:* Dead River · Domestic witness of media use

**Commentary (Romantic):** A **Violence & Secret Life** primer wrapped as after-school hours. The **device** is the format—panel, episode, cover—that delivers appetite to a child’s question.

---

### Clip (H3) — The town’s motto: causality for harm only
`|| Only bad things happen for a reason. Good things? Who knows and who cares. ||`  
*Filed:* Dead River · “Only Bad Things Happen for a Reason”

**Commentary:** The counting logic of causation is reserved for harm. It is a filing rule smuggled into speech: evidence for injuries; *shrug* for gifts.

## Testimony & Findings

**1) Category → Practice (Craving).**  
When a **cheat** sheet lists “forms of craving,” the town learns to feel in those forms. The handout is not a gloss; it is a **meter** for appetite. The Archive must track such **feedback ledgers**: where a catalog term becomes a daily habit of self-counting.

**2) Entertainment as laundering (Violence & Secret Life).**  
The **show/comic** converts private harm into public pastime. Five episodes in a day becomes a **dose**, a regimen; the cover art teaches a gaze. A younger child’s question (“why would a dog…?”) is the moment the ledger crosses into practice.

**3) Devices install routes (Mediation & Aperture).**  
Handout → route for craving; comic panel/TV episode → route for harm’s retelling. As with the Dead River **map** that installed a town, these formats are **apertures** that make conduct possible and common. Orders-first filing is required to keep cause visible.

**4) Institutional consequence (Phase IV).**  
Phase IV asks whether **catalog language creates cases**. In Dead River the answer is observable: labels circulate first on paper, then in bodies. The Archive’s hearing docket must record **how** names and formats travel back into practice.

## Disposition
**Entered.** Logged to the Phase IV Feedback Docket; referred to the Orders board for cross-indexing procedures (Craving ↔ Violence & Secret Life ↔ Mediation & Aperture).
