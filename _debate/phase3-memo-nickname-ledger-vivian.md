## Abstract
Names act as apertures: forms that install social legibility by constraining what may pass as a person. In Hilly Dale, children’s nicknames originate in voiced relations to **Vivian**; they stick, routinize, and govern circulation. The same thread shows a scarcity-driven session economy (“dates” with Vivian; puzzles vs. written instructions) that trains appetite and cadence. We recommend **Mediation & Aperture** as the primary Order, with cross-tags to **Craving** and **Silence & Withdrawal** where scarcity and non-speech drills shape practice.

## Exhibits

### Clip (V1) — Origin of Names (Relation → Device)
`|| Subdivision nicknames had their origins in comments that showed that kid’s relationship with Vivian. ||`

**Commentary (Philosophical):** The nickname is a fitted opening: a social mechanism that fixes a passage between speaker and subject. Once uttered with sufficient force, it becomes a public aperture through which the person is subsequently recognized and processed.

---

### Clip (V2) — Sessions, Acceptance, and Status Economy
`|| Cassie was the last kid in the subdivision to get a date with Vivian. The status attached to getting a session with Vivian outweighed the disgrace of not being accepted, especially given that nobody got accepted […] and parents could joke about acceptance rates being easier at Harvard than at Hilly Dale. ||`

**Commentary (Philosophical):** The session becomes a rationed portal; acceptance is nearly mythical. The apparatus teaches desire as countable scarcity (**Craving**) while sustaining the aperture’s authority regardless of its “success” rate.

---

### Clip (V3) — Puzzle vs. Instructions (Hands Before Words)
`|| Nobody else got a puzzle. Everyone got instructions left on the door or the table just inside the door… As far as Cassie knew, she was the first to get the puzzle treatment… ||`

**Commentary (Philosophical):** Two modalities of access—object-drill (puzzle) and remote directives (slips left on tables)—train cadence and compliance. The non-spoken regimen aligns with the Mirado tradition where speech withdraws and the hand carries the rule (**Silence & Withdrawal** cross-tag).

## Main Content/Argument
1) **Aperture Function of Names.** In Hilly Dale, a child’s nickname does not merely *reflect* character; it **installs** a handling protocol. Once uttered with the force of relation to Vivian, the name is adopted even by parents—evidence that the aperture becomes institutional, not private. Orders-first filing keeps the mechanism (naming-aperture) central rather than scattering it by household or street.

2) **Feedback Between Scarcity and Recognition.** The “date with Vivian” operates as a gate. Acceptance is rare; nevertheless, the *attempt* confers status. This teaches ledgered appetite (who was seen; who was refused) and proves that the device’s power is upstream of its outcomes—precisely a **Mediation & Aperture** signature, with **Craving** as a governed rhythm (desire paced by ration).

3) **Non-speech Instruction as Method.** The distribution of *puzzles* vs *door-left instructions* maps the Sticks/Tower cadence across town lines: hands first, words last. Where puzzles appear, the body is trained to know fit before saying fit; where slips appear, a written protocol does the same. The nickname ledger, session ledger, and instruction ledger are three faces of one aperture system.

4) **Policy Implication.** File all “Vivian-name/session” materials primarily under **Mediation & Aperture** (device: *Nickname Ledger*), with cross-Order tags to **Craving** (status economy) and **Silence & Withdrawal** (non-speech drill). Region remains secondary (Tower of Mirado / Mirado Sticks), preventing a reversion to geography-first shelving.

## Disposition
**Adopted.** Devices-first filing standard for Hilly Dale Nickname/Session materials:
- Primary Order: **Mediation & Aperture**
- Cross-Orders: **Craving**, **Silence & Withdrawal**
- Regions: **Tower of Mirado**, **Mirado Sticks** (provenance tags only)
