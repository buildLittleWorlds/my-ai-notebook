# Counter-Memo 23.4 — Against Overreach in the Filing of Densmok

**Session:** Senate-House, Cross-Orders Committee
**Author:** Archivist M. Keffel (Mid-Rank, North Wing)
**Date:** Year 23
**Status:** Filed with Objections; not canonized

## Abstract

This counter-memo responds to Memorandum 23.1 (*On the Necessity of Cross-Indexing Densmok*) by Senior Archivist J. Gravent. While acknowledging Gravent’s stature, I object to the rigidity of his directive. Densmok slips cannot be made to carry two or more Order tags *by decree*. To compel this is to replace evidence with taxonomy.

---

## Objections

1. **Not every slip doubles.**
   Gravent: "all Densmok slips inherently doubled." Record contradicts. Many mundane: invoices, chants, weather logs. Forcing metaphysics on rain logs = filing error.

2. **Craving not universal.**
   Singer-coders: documented. Bread price quarrels: not Craving. Stretching Orders = meaningless categories.

3. **Silence ≠ Withdrawal universally.**
   Mystic refusing rigs: Withdrawal. Tired clerk not transcribing: fatigue. Different phenomena. Gravent conflates. Filing accuracy compromised.

## Evidence from Densmok Slips

* **Slip DM-14:** || “A boy traded a cog for a boiled potato. No comment.” ||
  Filed Region: Densmok · Market Note.
  Order: None required.
* **Slip DM-21:** || “Rain poured on the node-rig. Sparks. Apprentice wept.” ||
  This may merit *Mediation & Aperture* but not *Craving*.
* **Slip DM-22:** || “A widow wrote: ‘He left, no tools, no songs.’ ||
  Absence, but not Withdrawal in the Sticks sense.

## Response to Authority

Gravent: Minute 3.7 "embarrassing." Counter-assessment: Gravent directive dangerous. Juniors obey Giant names, ignore slip evidence. Regional filing = discipline, not humility. Giants: metaphysics permitted. Clerks: paper sorting required.

---

## Proposal

* **Optional Orders for Densmok:** Cross-indexing to Orders should be recommended, not mandatory.
* **Retain Region-first:** Especially for mundane slips, Region is enough.
* **Introduce “Null Order” marker:** To file slips that bear no metaphysical weight.

## Closing

The hinge may turn the door, as Gravent writes. But not every scrap of wood is a hinge. Some are only splinters. We must be wary of making hinges where there are none.
