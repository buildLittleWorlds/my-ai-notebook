# Counter-Memo 23.4 — Against Overreach in the Filing of Densmok

**Session:** Senate-House, Cross-Orders Committee
**Author:** Archivist M. Keffel (Mid-Rank, North Wing)
**Date:** Year 23
**Status:** Filed with Objections; not canonized

## Abstract

This counter-memo responds to Memorandum 23.1 (*On the Necessity of Cross-Indexing Densmok*) by Senior Archivist J. Gravent. While acknowledging Gravent’s stature, I object to the rigidity of his directive. Densmok slips cannot be made to carry two or more Order tags *by decree*. To compel this is to replace evidence with taxonomy.

---

## Grounds for Objection

1. **Not every slip doubles itself.**
   Gravent asserts that “all Densmok slips are inherently doubled.” This is not borne out by record. Many are mundane: tool-shop invoices, children’s chants, weather notes. To force “Doubling” or “Craving” upon them is to write metaphysics where only rain fell.

2. **Craving is not universal.**
   Yes, the singers-coders show appetite turned into rig. But a transcript of a Densmok quarrel about bread prices is not evidence of “Craving.” If we stretch the Order until everything fits, it no longer signifies.

3. **Silence is not always Withdrawal.**
   The mystic who refuses rigs may be Withdrawal. But a clerk too tired to transcribe is not. Gravent collapses fatigue, poverty, and mysticism under one drawer. This is distortion.

## Evidence from Densmok Slips

* **Slip DM-14:** || “A boy traded a cog for a boiled potato. No comment.” ||
  Filed Region: Densmok · Market Note.
  Order: None required.
* **Slip DM-21:** || “Rain poured on the node-rig. Sparks. Apprentice wept.” ||
  This may merit *Mediation & Aperture* but not *Craving*.
* **Slip DM-22:** || “A widow wrote: ‘He left, no tools, no songs.’ ||
  Absence, but not Withdrawal in the Sticks sense.

## Irritation at Giants

Gravent calls Minute 3.7 (*Provenance First*) “embarrassing.” I call Gravent’s pronouncement dangerous. It tempts juniors to obey the *name* of a Giant instead of the evidence of a slip. It is not humility to file by Region; it is discipline. Giants may afford metaphysics, but clerks must sort paper.

---

## Proposal

* **Optional Orders for Densmok:** Cross-indexing to Orders should be recommended, not mandatory.
* **Retain Region-first:** Especially for mundane slips, Region is enough.
* **Introduce “Null Order” marker:** To file slips that bear no metaphysical weight.

## Closing

The hinge may turn the door, as Gravent writes. But not every scrap of wood is a hinge. Some are only splinters. We must be wary of making hinges where there are none.
