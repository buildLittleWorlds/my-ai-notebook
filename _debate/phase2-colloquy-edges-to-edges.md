## Abstract
A small phrase—“edges to edges”—taught at a table with a puzzle, keeps living in the hand after the mouth is quiet. I file this note to show how **a catechism** turns language into **technique**, and how that technique keeps working inside the body long after speech withdraws. Silence here is not absence—it is the track the words lay down, then leave behind.

## Exhibits

**Clip (H1) — Tower catechism**
|| I kept repeating to him, each time something didn’t fit, “edges to edges,” … After a while of doing this, once when something didn’t fit, he said softly to himself, “edges to edges,” and turned the piece. ||
**Provenance:** Tower · Puzzle lesson (catechism drill)  
**Order(s):** Silence & Withdrawal  
**Commentary (Romantic):** A sentence enters the hand. After the drill, the mouth recedes; the motion remains. The boy keeps a rule inside his wrist.

**Clip (I2) — Sticks breath-ledger**
|| “They sit in circles, speaking only the length of the inhale and the length of the exhale. Each circle is a ledger. Each ledger is torn and remade with every breath.” ||  
**Provenance:** Mirado Sticks · Clinic Records & Testimonies  
**Order(s):** Silence & Withdrawal  
**Commentary (Romantic):** Here the voice is only counting time—the rest is hands and lungs: a ledger rewritten by the body, not the clerk.

## Main Content
The Tower keeps the recursive work—words about words, speech that teaches speech. But not all speech in the Tower is theory; some of it is **method** the way a cart is a method. The catechism “edges to edges” does not describe a puzzle; it *makes* a puzzle solvable. The phrase repeats until it becomes a hinge in the body, a felt hinge that clicks without being spoken.

That hinge belongs with **Silence & Withdrawal**. We mistake silence for zero and miss the practice inside it: breath recitation in Sticks, catechism in Tower. In both, the voice is a scaffolding that is meant to disappear once the structure stands. The Archive’s Appendix already anchors Tower/Sticks under this Order; I am simply writing the living proof into the drawer they named.

A clerk might ask: where is the **place**? The catechism happened at a table, the breath circles in Sticks. But when I watch the boy turn his hand, when I sit with the circles and count each inhale/exhale, I see the same engine: speech that withdraws after doing its work. Filing by **Region** would scatter that kinship. Filing by **Order** keeps the method together.

I acknowledge the standing policy—the old admonition that we are custodians, not philosophers; that geography endures while speech and doctrine slide. But a withdrawal practice is **evidence**, not a doctrine: a child’s hand turning a piece; a ring of chests rising and falling. Those are not theories. They are acts that leave ledgers, even when the ledger is a habit in a wrist or the length of an exhale.

## Disposition
**Filed Without Action.** (Note acknowledged; no change to primary drawers.)

## Cross-References
- **Phase I — [Minute 3.7 — “Provenance First”]({{ '/debate/phase1-minute-3-7/' | relative_url }})** — the geography-first rationale this note presses against.
- **Phase II — [Colloquy Note 14.6 — On Withdrawal as a Filing Principle]({{ '/debate/phase2-colloquy-fivefold/' | relative_url }})** — parallel argument from Sticks testimony.
- **Phase II — [Case Note 19.4 — On the Pickbox Cart and Authorless Burden]({{ '/debate/phase2-case-pickbox/' | relative_url }})** — a device treated as *aperture*, not object; kinship with method-as-aperture logic here.
