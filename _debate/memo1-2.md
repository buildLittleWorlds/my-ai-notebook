## Introduction

Our earliest efforts divided knowledge purely by **region**: Dens, Densmok, Yeller Quarry, Dead River, Northo, North Town, Capital, Capeast, Mirado Sticks, and the Tower. This geographical sorting served us well when records were sparse. But as the Archive has swollen with contradictory accounts, mythic fragments, and lived testimony, it has become clear that *region alone cannot carry the weight of Densworld's reality*.

I propose we add **Borough Drawers**: not fixed geographic labels but conceptual drawers that cut across regions, storing materials by metaphysical function.

## The Problem with Geography Alone

* **Dens** is not just a place. It is *degradation, edge, disintegration*.
* **Densmok** is more than a suburb: it is *the speech-act of craving*.
* **North Town** is not merely a northern settlement: it embodies *secret lives, murder songs, and the missionary-as-serial killer*.
* **Dead River** is not only a wasteland: it is *choice itself, the western detour, the other fantasy-world that resists incorporation*.

When placed in drawers marked only by geography, these aspects scatter or are lost.

## The Borough Drawer System

I propose a system of *drawers*—conceptual categories that hold records regardless of where they are sourced. Examples:

* **Craving Drawer**: Holds accounts of desire in its forms—

  * Densmok's arbitrary speech-desires.
  * Yeller Quarry's natural craving, grungy or luminous.
  * North Town's moral craving.
  * Capital's exploitation of others' cravings.

* **Speech Drawer**:

  * Dens as initiation of speech.
  * Densmok as distortion and multiplication of speech.
  * Tower as management of speech.
  * Mirado Sticks as destruction of speech.

* **Cart Drawer**: All stories of pickbox carts, mapmakers, roving collectors—threads that traverse Dens, North, Northo, and Capital alike.

* **Edge Drawer**: Records where the world's border breaks—

  * The Dens wilderness as consuming edge.
  * Dead River as outlaw edge.
  * Tower as metaphysical edge of recursion.

## Implications

1. **Flexibility**: A single account may sit in multiple drawers. (The Mapmaker's Pickbox Cart may rest both in the *Cart Drawer* and in the *Murder Drawer* when girls vanish within it.)
2. **Cross-borough Insight**: Drawers expose metaphysical continuities that geography obscures.
3. **Control**: By categorizing Densworld through metaphysics, the Archive shapes not just knowledge but the very possibilities of the world.

## Anticipated Objections

* *"Regions are real, drawers are invented."* — But regions are also inventions; Dens is both dirt and concept. The Archive's task is not to mirror reality but to systematize its flux.
* *"Drawers risk arbitrariness."* — True. But arbitrariness already rules; the Archive's task is to name it.

## Conclusion

The Borough Drawer system is not a replacement for regional cataloging but a second layer: regions remain the **shelves**, drawers are the **compartments** within them.

We must accept: to archive Densworld is to legislate it. To file is to decide.
