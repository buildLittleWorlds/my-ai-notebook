# Graduate Student Context — **Archivists’ Debate** (Orders-first, in-character)

This section contains **in-character institutional documents** about how the Capital Archive organizes reality. It is not the Archive (primary slips); it’s the Archive’s **self-argument**—memos, minutes, hearings, rulings—about **how** to file, by **what** principles, and **why** it matters. The core tension is not only **Region vs. Orders**, but the clash of three **archivist temperaments**: **Clerkly**, **Romantic**, and **Philosophical**.

---

## 0) What you’re doing here (and the voice to use)

You will write documents **as a Capital archivist**, in one of the three temperamental voices. These are official papers that “leaked” into a public shelf—bureaucratic but with personality. Each document should **embody one temperament clearly** while acknowledging the other two exist.

**The central question:**
*Does the archive mirror the world’s structure, or does the archive’s language help shape it?*

---

## 1) Orders before Regions (the methodological core)

Debate documents revolve around the policy shift to file by **Orders** (primary) → then by **Form** → then **Regions** (secondary). The six Orders are your top-level lenses:

1. **Boundary** — unstable edges; town/wilderness; lines that move
2. **Doubling** — originals-without-origin; proliferations; roads that bud
3. **Craving** — desire as engine; appetites that make artifacts
4. **Silence & Withdrawal** — non-speech methods; hand before word
5. **Violence & Secret Life** — parallel ledgers of harm; public melody/private confession
6. **Mediation & Aperture** — windows, devices, carts; constraints on access & authorship

**Filing rule:** **Orders-first** (1–3) → **Form** (Memo/Minute/etc.) → **Regions** (provenance).

## 2) The three temperaments (pick one per doc)

* **Clerkly** — Procedural custodians; fear chaos; short, precise sentences; fixate on custody, stamps, protocol. “Filed under Dens. Contradiction noted.”
* **Romantic** — Narrative witnesses; fear fragmentation and silence; dramatize tensions; let minor voices speak. “She swore the ditch had grown; the town agreed.”
* **Philosophical** — Systematizers; fear incoherence; legislate categories; write abstractly about Orders and patterns.

**Balance policy:** Across the Debate collection, maintain the historical balance:
Phase I (Clerkly-dominant), Phase II (all three emerge), Phase III (Philosophical-dominant), Phase IV (three-way collision).

---

## 3) Four phases (your institutional timeline)

* **Phase I — Regional Drawers (Years 1–12).** Provenance-first doctrine; clerkly dominance; early systematizing seeds.
* **Phase II — Faults in Geography (Years 13–20).** Contradictions spill across boroughs; the three voices fully appear.
* **Phase III — Orders Proposal (Year 22).** Six Orders proposed; philosophical dominance; clerkly resistance.
* **Phase IV — Implementation & Objections (Year 23+).** Orders-first directive, cross-indexing; hearings on catalog feedback effects.

A Debate hub page organizes docs by these phases and links out to example documents and an Appendix of sources.

---

## 4) What kinds of documents exist here?

**Document types** (choose one): Memo, Minute, Field Report, Colloquy Note, Counter-Memo, Directive, Hearing, Ruling, Brief, Case Note.
Each type *tends* toward a temperament (e.g., Minutes → Clerkly; Memos/Briefs → Philosophical; Colloquy/Hearings → Romantic) but any temperament is allowed if you stay coherent.

---

## 5) How evidence is handled in Debate docs

Every Debate doc quotes **at least one Clip** (verbatim excerpt) and comments on it **in your chosen temperament**. Use the Clip **protocol block** (|| … ||), provenance, and a one-to-three-sentence commentary in voice. Keep contradictions intact: **contradictions are evidence** (clerks preserve, romantics dramatize, philosophers systematize).

A working Clip example (often used for **Mediation & Aperture**):
`|| Face-window shall be circular; no door; slips only. ||` → then provenance + temperament-matched commentary.

---

## 6) Success criteria (what “good” looks like)

Readers should be able to answer: **why** Orders superseded Regions; **how** filing changes interpretation; **where** to find anchors; **who** the three archivist types are; and **when** each temperament dominated across phases. Internally: Debate docs should cite ≥2 slips, and each phase should reflect its expected temperamental balance.

---

## 7) Navigation, cross-linking, and structure

* Use **phase-sorted** URLs and filenames for Debate docs; the hub page lists a few per phase and grows later.
* Enforce **bidirectional links** between Archive slips and Debate docs so readers see evidence ↔ policy: add a footer line on slips pointing to the relevant Debate file.
* UI conventions: phase pills, breadcrumbs, and small status badges for Adopted/Draft/Superseded.

---

## 8) Quick temperament cheatsheet (voice markers)

* **Clerkly:** terse; protocol-obsessed; stamps, codes; “filed, noted” cadence.
* **Romantic:** testimonial; lets minor voices speak; asks opening questions.
* **Philosophical:** abstract; confident; frames evidence as proof of an Order.

Keep one voice per document. Across the collection, rotate all three to keep the institutional tension alive.
