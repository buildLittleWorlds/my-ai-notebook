# Colloquy Note 14.6 — On Withdrawal as a Filing Principle

**Session:** Informal Colloquy, Senate-House Annex B
**Recorder:** Minor Archivist E. Dell
**Date:** Year 15 (interim between Phase II field reports)
**Status:** Logged but not adopted

---

## Opening

I write as a junior member, knowing full well this note may not survive to the official minutes. Yet silence itself has become evidence, and I take the risk of filing a small disturbance into the drawer marked “debate.”

The issue: **our categories omit Withdrawal**.

## Witness Material (Mirado Sticks)

### Clip A — Return to the Physical

|| “The addict, tired of hallucinated rivers, goes back to the body: skin, tongue, scars. He calls this *return* the only cure.” ||

### Clip B — Recitation of Breath

|| “They sit in circles, speaking only the length of the inhale and the length of the exhale. Each circle is a ledger. Each ledger is torn and remade with every breath.” ||

### Clip C — Refusal to Sing

|| “One woman, once a singer, refused all song. Her silence was counted as louder than any stanza.” ||

**Filed Provenance:** *Mirado Sticks · Clinic Records & Testimonies*
**Cross-Order Proposal:** Silence & Withdrawal

## Argument

1. **Geography fails here.**
   To say simply “these slips belong to *Sticks*” conceals what they actually perform: not a place, but a *method of erasure*. The addict’s return, the breath-ledgers, the refusal of song — these are not reducible to a village on a map.

2. **Withdrawal is not lack.**
   The senior clerks often dismiss these slips as “incomplete.” They say: *no doctrine, no consistency, discard.* I argue the opposite: the missing speech is the doctrine. Withdrawal is its own category, active as fire or hunger.

3. **Filing by Withdrawal preserves contradictions.**
   The “return to the body” and the “refusal of song” might seem opposed — one re-engages the physical, the other disengages the sonic. Yet together they make a practice of pulling back. Filing them under Region disperses this kinship. Filing them under Withdrawal reveals it.

## Irritations with Prior Policy

I have read and re-read Minute 3.7 (*Provenance First*). With respect: it has nothing to say about silence. Geography offers no tools for recording a refusal.

The *custodian* stance is comfortable for those who handle songs, tools, artifacts. But what of the archivist who must file a breath, a renunciation, a blank? To be “custodian” of a gap is to accept that the gap is an entry.

## Proposed Filing Mark

> **Order:** Silence & Withdrawal
> **Form:** Testimony / Clinic Ledger
> **Region:** Mirado Sticks

---

## Disposition

This note was politely thanked and shelved. No adoption. The senior clerk wrote in the margin: *“Silence is not evidence.”*

Yet silence has been my entire evidence.

## Closing Reflection

If one day the Archive creates drawers beyond Region, let it remember this: that a breath and a refusal were once brought forward, and that a minor archivist insisted they deserved a place.
