**Session:** Senate-House Working Group on Orders, Year 22
**Author:** Senior Archivist T. Varro
**Status:** Circulated; appended to Orders Memorandum

## Abstract

Minute 3.7 (*Provenance First*, Year 8) continues to be cited by junior staff as if it were holy writ. The insistence that “geography is least falsifiable” has hardened into a superstition. This memo records why that Minute must now be retired, or at minimum cross-indexed with the metaphysical Orders that better capture the world’s own divisions.

## Complaint

1. **Provenance does not endure.**
   The ditch on the west road to Dens shifted in Year 17; testimony and meter readings now diverge in location as well as in content. To say “place endures” is to close one’s eyes to moving ground.

2. **Witnesses contradict, but so do places.**
   North Town has fractured into North, Northo, and yet the older slips still bear the “North Town” stamp. Which place “endures”? The Minute offers no remedy.

3. **Custody ≠ Truth.**
   The early clerks imagined themselves “custodians, not philosophers.” Yet the act of filing already interprets. The refusal to name Orders (Boundary, Doubling, Craving, etc.) was not modesty but negligence.

## Evidence

* **Slip D-17 (Dens):** Filed under Dens per Minute 3.7. In retrospect, clearly a *Boundary* case. The regional label obscured this for a decade.
* **Slip Q-09 (Quarry silhouettes):** Provenance is mixed; replication is the core. To force “Quarry” as primary mark is to pretend authenticity is tied to soil.
* **Slip DR-02 (Dead River detour):** The fantasy recorded there resists “Dead River” entirely; it belongs under *Withdrawal*.

## Tone of Irritation

It is wearying to hear junior archivists quote the Closing Admonition of Minute 3.7 — “Archivists are not philosophers. We are custodians.” This slogan is trotted out like a prayer whenever a slip threatens to overflow its drawer. Yet who decides what a “drawer” is, if not us? To invoke “custody” is already to legislate. We were always philosophers, however reluctant.

## Disposition

Minute 3.7 shall remain in the ledger but with the following notation: *Superseded by Orders Memorandum 22.1*. Any appeal to “Provenance First” without concurrent Order-tagging is to be dismissed as dereliction.
