## Abstract
The Capital’s doctrine is device-first: **knowledge may pass; bodies may not**. This directive formalizes the **Head-Third Standard** for licensed archivist shop windows to convert a narrative custom into a measurable **aperture**. Inspections and tolerances are specified so the window continues to govern passage without drift.

## Exhibits
**Exhibit A — The window, as practiced**  
|| A minor archivist waited at his window… Each archivist shop in the Capital… had a single window out front. No walk-in entrance. The shop window was a round hole a third the size of the archivist’s head. ||

**Exhibit B — City access is credentialed, not open**  
|| There was never actually a way to drive into the Cap. You could ride—if you had a driver. But you couldn’t, yourself, just drive into the Cap, the real city-center Cap. ||

## Main Content / Argument
1) **Principle (Orders-first).** The Capital regulates **apertures** instead of crowds. Windows and licensed drivers are parallel devices: both **let records move while keeping bodies outside**. Formalizing the window’s ratio preserves that function in measurable terms.

2) **Problem.** Customary “one-third head” has drifted in practice: some shops enlarge to hasten queues; others shrink to deter disputants. Without specification, the **Order** degrades into a superstition rather than a device.

3) **Rationale.** A calibrated window creates a consistent **mediation** across neighborhoods; the driver-license regime proves the city already governs access by **device**, not preference.

## Directive (Standards)
- **D1. Gauge.** The circular window opening shall equal **0.33 × the licensed archivist’s head breadth** (ear-to-ear), measured by city caliper at annual renewal; allowable tolerance **±0.02**. (If the licensed archivist changes, recalibrate within 10 days.)  
- **D2. Passage class.** Only **slips, receipts, ledgers, and sealed cylinders ≤ window diameter** may pass. No rolled garments, food, or tools.  
- **D3. Counter-drift audit.** Inspections quarterly; failure triggers **temporary seal** and re-measurement.  
- **D4. Queue management.** Shops must post **tolerance card** at the window; disputes are logged as **aperture incidents** for city review.  
- **D5. Cross-device harmony.** Where driver intake counters exist, synchronize inspection weeks so **window and driver** regimes reinforce mediation rather than shift the crowd elsewhere.

## Disposition
**Adopted.** Standards circulate to Licensing & Tolerances; first inspection sweep scheduled next quarter.
