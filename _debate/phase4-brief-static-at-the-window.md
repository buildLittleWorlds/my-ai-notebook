## Abstract

This brief addresses whether architectural design at the Capital’s South Arcade—specifically the round aperture—merely **admits** evidence or also **creates** aspects of the case. The question sits within the Debate’s core tension (“mirror vs maker”) and uses Slip A1 to test how residue (“static”) is treated as part of the record rather than noise .

## Exhibits

**Slip: A1 — Capital: Window Aperture, South Arcade (caliper check log)**
**Provenance:** Capital · Licensing Board Annex II (Quarterly Caliper Inspections)
**Clip (A1):**
`|| 1. Aperture Spec. Face-window shall be circular; clear diameter not to exceed one-third cranial width of licensed archivist on duty. No door; no walk-in ingress. Exchange of slips only. ||`&#x20;
`|| 2. Tolerance. ±2 mm on interior rim; hairline fissures to be tar-inked and re-lacquered within 24 hours. ||`&#x20;
`|| 3. Incidents Noted. Two instances of grit-induced feed distortion ("static") during receipt of Quarry hunt sketches; one instance of Dens-residue on ledger paper; all remediated with double-lining and bristle-brush cleanse. ||`&#x20;
`|| 4. Status. PASS. Advisory: re-check lacquer before festival week. ||`&#x20;
**Order(s):** Mediation & Aperture
**Commentary:** The aperture is a policy device: it admits paper, excludes bodies, and forces residue to declare itself where it lands.

**Slip: A2 — Capital: The Minor Archivist & Senate Stairs (licensing notes)**
**Provenance:** Capital · Stairwell/Aperture Compliance
**Clip (A2):**
`|| The shop front shall admit no bodies by door. A circular aperture suffices for slips, receipts, and ledgers. ||`&#x20;
`|| Senate stairs: rise shallow, tread narrow; designed to slow crowds while favoring licensed knees. ||`&#x20;
**Order(s):** Mediation & Aperture
**Commentary:** Window and stair combine: one filters **what** may cross, the other controls **how fast** it approaches.

## Main Content

The Debate’s center line—“Does the archive mirror the world’s structure, or does the archive’s language help shape it?”—is not abstract when applied to the South Arcade aperture; it is operational policy . The inspection log (Slip A1) codifies a design that constrains admissible form (slips, not bodies), tolerances (±2 mm), and remediation protocols (tar-ink, lacquer), thereby legislating **how** reality must arrive if it is to be filed . In the Capital, architecture is the filter; the round window is the canonical emblem of this method .

Notably, “static” incidents—Quarry grit distorting the feed, Dens residue on the ledger—are not deleted; they are recorded and cleaned, then implicitly attached to the testimony as cost of passage . This follows the ethical directive to **not erase residues**: grit, hum, and burr are part of the message, not noise . Thus, the aperture does not merely **mirror** a pre-existing world; it **shapes** the evidentiary object by compelling it to present as a slip with traceable contaminants.

Slip A2 extends the doctrine: no door; the circular opening suffices for exchange, while the Senate stairs throttle flow in favor of licensed knees—speed itself is regulated as part of custody . The Capital’s voice instructs us to treat devices (windows, stairs) as **mediation**: the building is part of the authorship chain, not scenery . Accordingly, indexing under **Mediation & Aperture** is not aesthetic; it is the city’s theory of truth in practice .

Finally, the commentary that “This window is not a door. The rule is design: knowledge may pass; bodies may not… \[and] we file the weather with the text” makes the interpretive stance explicit: residues enter the case file as evidence of contact, not as error . For Debate purposes, Slip A1 therefore serves as a Phase IV anchor for implementation arguments and edge-case rulings concerning how catalog policy feeds back into practice.

## Disposition

**Adopted.** Re-check lacquer before festival week; continue logging residues as co-traveling evidence with each slip (no deletion; remediation + docket note) .
