## Phase I — Regional Drawers (Years 1–12) {#phase-1}

- **[Memo 1.2 — Establishment of Borough Drawers](/debate/memo1-2/)**  
  *policy draft; filing by Dens, Quarry, North, Capital, Tower, Sticks, Dead River*

- **Minute 3.7 — Rationale: Provenance First**  
  *argues that geography is the least falsifiable attribute*

## Phase II — Faults in Geography (Years 13–20) {#phase-2}

- **Field Report — Dens Boundary Readings vs. Contradictory Testimonies**  
  *shows meter data track with stories; region label fails explanatory burden*

- **Colloquy Note — The Fivefold Silhouette Copies**  
  *provenance mixed; authenticity recurs as a doubling problem, not a place problem*

## Phase III — Orders Proposal (Year 22) {#phase-3}

Introduction of the six **Orders**: Boundary; Doubling; Craving; Silence & Withdrawal; Violence & Secret Life;
Mediation & Aperture.

- **Memorandum — "Toward a Unified Scheme of Archival Ordering" (T. Varro)**  
  *cornerstone text; Orders supersede region as primary class*

- **Counter-Memo — "On the Danger of Metaphysics in Filing" (S. Kettel)**  
  *argues the archive risks shaping reality through labels*

## Phase IV — Implementation & Objections (Year 23– ) {#phase-4}

- **Directive — Cross-Indexing Orders with Region**  
  *compromise policy; provenance retained for chain-of-custody*

- **Hearing — "Does the Catalog Create the Case?"**  
  *testimony from Sticks clinics and North singers on how labels travel back*

## Appendix — Selected Sources {#appendix}

Internal references grounding the Orders (examples):

- **Boundary:** Dens "two kinds of story" & ditch readings
- **Doubling:** Quarry journeys & fivefold silhouettes (Castelia)
- **Craving:** Densmok coder-singers & rig practices
- **Silence & Withdrawal:** Sticks withdrawal / Tower catechism ("edges to edges")
- **Violence & Secret Life:** North murder songs; Dead River "counting five"
- **Mediation & Aperture:** Capital window; Pickbox cart distanciation
