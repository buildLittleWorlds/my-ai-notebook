This hub collects internal memoranda, colloquy minutes, and circulars regarding the re-organization of
the Capital archive. The central question: *Does the archive mirror the world's structure, or does the
archive's language help shape it?*

But the Archive does not speak in one voice. The documents below reveal three distinct **archivist temperaments**, each approaching the same evidence with different fears, hopes, and methods:

- **Clerkly Archivists**: Procedural custodians focused on stamps, protocols, and preservation. They distrust both story and metaphysics.
- **Romantic Archivists**: Narrativizing witnesses who want slips to cohere into stories. They write like storytellers rather than clerks.  
- **Philosophical Archivists**: Systematizing legislators confident that categories reveal metaphysical truths. They reshape filing systems with systematic ambition.

The debate unfolds as a four-phase institutional drama, with the balance of temperaments shifting over time.

## Phase I — Regional Drawers (Years 1–12) {#phase-1}

**Temperamental balance:** Clerkly dominance, with occasional philosophical seeds. Romance barely appears.

- **[Memo 1.2 — Establishment of Borough Drawers]({{ '/debate/phase1-memo-1-2/' | relative_url }})** **(Philosophical)**  
  *Early systematizing disguised as protocol; proposes conceptual drawers across regions*

- **[Minute 3.7 — Rationale: Provenance First]({{ '/debate/phase1-minute-3-7/' | relative_url }})** **(Clerkly)**  
  *Pure procedural precision; argues that geography is the least falsifiable attribute*

- **[Minute 3.12 — Slip DR-02: On a Town Named by a Map]({{ '/debate/phase1-minute-3-12-dead-river-map/' | relative_url }})** **(Clerkly)**  
  *Phase I filing of Dead River evidence showing town created by map-device rather than geographical features*

## Phase II — Faults in Geography (Years 13–20) {#phase-2}

**Temperamental balance:** All three temperaments emerge clearly for the first time. Phase II is the hinge.

- **[Field Report 17.2 — On the Dens Boundary vs. Testimony]({{ '/debate/phase2-field-edges-report/' | relative_url }})** **(Clerkly)**  
  *Lanver's mechanical documentation of unstable Dens boundary where ditch meters and testimony contradict*

- **[Colloquy Note 18.9 — On the Fivefold Silhouette Copies]({{ '/debate/phase2-colloquy-withdrawal/' | relative_url }})** **(Philosophical)**  
  *Corvell's systematic reframing of authenticity as Doubling problem; provenance fails, recurrence is crisp*

- **[Colloquy Note 16.2 — "Edges to Edges": Catechism as Method]({{ '/debate/phase2-colloquy-edges-to-edges/' | relative_url }})** **(Romantic)**  
  *Dell's testimonial exploration of Tower catechism and Sticks breath practices as withdrawal methods*

- **[Colloquy Note 14.6 — On Withdrawal as a Filing Principle]({{ '/debate/phase2-colloquy-fivefold/' | relative_url }})** **(Romantic)**  
  *Dell's testimonial recognition that silence and withdrawal constitute active methods, not mere absence*

- **[Case Note 19.4 — On the Pickbox Cart and Authorless Burden]({{ '/debate/phase2-case-pickbox/' | relative_url }})** **(Romantic)**  
  *Durn's narrative documentation of the authorless cart; proposes Mediation & Aperture through witness voices*

- **[Case Note 20.3 — On "Yeller": Fivefold Signs and the Missing]({{ '/debate/phase2-case-yeller-fivefold/' | relative_url }})** **(Romantic)**  
  *Dell's testimonial exploration of "yeller" as encoded violence; public melody hiding private confession*

- **[Case Note 20.7 — Map Without River: How a Device Makes a Town]({{ '/debate/phase2-case-dead-river-map-of-maps/' | relative_url }})** **(Philosophical)**  
  *Dell's systematic analysis of Dead River as map-generated place; device-first filing over regional classification*

- **[Case Note 20.9 — Counting as Device (The Recruiter & the Pickbox Cart)]({{ '/debate/phase2-case-counting-device-pickbox/' | relative_url }})** **(Romantic)**  
  *Dell's testimonial analysis of five-count recruitment method and pickbox cart as doubling devices operating through numerical recurrence*

## Phase III — Orders Proposal (Year 22) {#phase-3}

**Temperamental balance:** Philosophical dominance with clerkly resistance. Romance largely absent—systematizers vs. custodians.

Introduction of the six **Orders**: Boundary; Doubling; Craving; Silence & Withdrawal; Violence & Secret Life;
Mediation & Aperture.

- **Memorandum — "Toward a Unified Scheme of Archival Ordering" (T. Varro)** **(Philosophical)**  
  *cornerstone systematization; Orders supersede region as primary class*

- **[Counter-Memo 22.4 — On the Stubbornness of "Provenance First"]({{ '/debate/phase3-counter-memo-metaphysics-risk/' | relative_url }})** **(Philosophical)**  
  *Varro's systematic challenge to Minute 3.7; argues geography as "least falsifiable" has hardened into superstition*

- **[Memorandum 22.7 — Devices that Install Institutions: The Crawford Library & the Church]({{ '/debate/phase3-memo-devices-install-institutions/' | relative_url }})** **(Philosophical)**  
  *Dell's systematic analysis of institutional devices; library and church as civic apertures that create public legibility*

- **[Brief 22.9 — Verbal Maps as Aperture (Lord Fullman Grist)]({{ '/debate/phase3-brief-verbal-maps-grist/' | relative_url }})** **(Philosophical)**  
  *Dell's systematic analysis of spoken mapmaking as aperture operation, extending device logic to verbal practices*

- **Counter-Memo — "On the Danger of Metaphysics in Filing" (S. Kettel)** **(Clerkly)**  
  *anxious pushback warning the archive risks shaping reality through labels*

## Phase IV — Implementation & Objections (Year 23– ) {#phase-4}

**Temperamental balance:** All three temperaments collide, generating institutional self-consciousness about the Archive's world-shaping role.

- **[Memorandum 23.1 — On the Necessity of Cross-Indexing Densmok]({{ '/debate/phase4-memo-densmok-crossindex/' | relative_url }})** **(Philosophical)**  
  *Gravent's systematic masterwork establishing cross-indexing requirements; Densmok as "hinge" between regions*

- **[Hearing 23.6 — Cheats, Shows, and the Feedback Ledger (Dead River)]({{ '/debate/phase4-hearing-dead-river-feedback-ledger/' | relative_url }})** **(Romantic)**  
  *Dell's testimonial hearing documenting feedback loops between archival categories and Dead River practices through entertainment and circulation devices*

- **[Counter-Memo 23.4 — Against Overreach in the Filing of Densmok]({{ '/debate/phase4-counter-memo-overreach/' | relative_url }})** **(Clerkly)**  
  *Keffel's anxious response to Gravent; warns against mandatory cross-indexing replacing evidence with taxonomy*

## Appendix — Selected Sources {#appendix}

Internal references grounding the Orders (examples):

- **Boundary:** Dens "two kinds of story" & ditch readings
- **Doubling:** Quarry journeys & fivefold silhouettes (Castelia)
- **Craving:** Densmok coder-singers & rig practices
- **Silence & Withdrawal:** Sticks withdrawal / Tower catechism ("edges to edges")
- **Violence & Secret Life:** North murder songs; Dead River "counting five"
- **Mediation & Aperture:** Capital window; Pickbox cart distanciation
