## Abstract
A man hunts by **count**. He watches for a tap that **repeats**, listening for the **number five**. His tool is a **pickbox cart**—a burden with “corners beyond corners,” **“a region unto itself.”** This case files *counting as device* under **Doubling** (recurrence as content) with **Craving** cross-tagged (a felt meter that selects and seduces). It ties the **five-count** used in recruitment to the **fivefold** structures that haunt Dead River.

## Exhibits

**Clip (DR1) — Recruitment by count**
`|| The sign was a tap that repeated … The sign was a tap that repeated, that seemed synchronized to some count the girl might mouth … And there was a number he was after. Five. ||`

**Commentary (Romantic):** A body makes a metronome and the metronome chooses the body. The device is not the cart yet; it’s the **count**.

**Clip (DR2) — The pickbox cart (“a region unto itself”)**
`|| The wood of those woods were what he rode on … gave this pickbox cart its smell of old and always gathering forces, corners beyond corners, **a region unto itself**. ||`  
*Filed:* Dead River · Recruiter’s gear ledger :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**Commentary:** A cart that makes its own geography; an aperture that encloses routes inside itself.

**Clip (NT1) — When the cart runs without a master**
`|| The cart rolled without him. It killed two girls. The song says: “pick, pick, pick,” but no name sings with it. ||`  
*Filed:* North Town · Murder song (cross-witness for the cart) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**Commentary:** Recurrence without authorship: the sound of **picking** is what persists. The cart behaves as a method, not a possession.

**Clip (DR3) — Fivefold as the town’s figure**
`|| … the fivefold figure in silhouette … the persistent question: how can a single fivefold being — five women-one being — maintain itself over generations? ||`  
*Filed:* Dead River · Yeller discourse (fivefold) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

**Commentary:** Dead River’s emblem is **five**. The recruiter’s count rhymes with the town’s form.

## Main Content

**1) Counting as aperture (primary: Doubling).**  
The recruiter’s **tap** is a gate: open only when the body falls into **five**. This is **recurrence as content**—not “where” a tap occurs, but **how often**. Filing under **Doubling** keeps that logic front and center (multiples, copies, counts) while **Region** remains provenance. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**2) Cart as private geography (secondary: Craving).**  
The pickbox cart is “**a region unto itself**,” gathering “corners beyond corners.” It offers enclosure, secrecy, selection. Desire is engineered through the pairing of **count + container**: the meter chooses; the cart keeps. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

**3) Authorless operation.**  
When the cart **“rolled without him”**, the method outlived the maker. This is why **authorship** won’t rescue Provenance-first filing: the **device** and the **count** act on their own. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

**4) Fivefold world.**  
Dead River’s signature recurrence—**fivefold Yeller**—mirrors the recruiter’s count. These are not metaphors; they are **operational repetitions** that sort people and stories. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Disposition
**Filed Without Action.** Logged to Orders board; senior clerks note “insufficient basis to elevate counting to primary evidence.” (Cross-index retained.)
