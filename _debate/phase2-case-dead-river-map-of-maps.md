## Abstract
Dead River is named into being by a **map**, not by attributes: no river, no church, no speech—yet a town persists as a cataloged aperture. The map then **multiplies** (“from that map, another, and from that one, ten”), presenting recurrence without origin. This case files the Dead River materials under **Mediation & Aperture** (device that grants access / authorship) with **Doubling** as a cross-Order: maps-of-maps as replication rather than representation. The filing question: when a device installs a site, how can Region be primary?

## Exhibits

**Clip (DR1) — Dead River: town named by map, maps of maps**  
`|| The town of Dead River had nor river nor whores nor sheriff nor church. No church because no river for waters of baptism. No whores because no women. No sheriff because no men. No words because no speech. No history because no etchings in rock above ground nor in cave beneath. The town of Dead River could be called a town only because a map had named it. And from that map, another map, and from that one, ten. The man who stood in Dead River now held out in his hands before him such a map. ||`  
**Provenance:** Dead River · “Dead River Whores” sequence  
**Order(s):** Mediation & Aperture; Doubling  
**Commentary (Philosophical):** The map operates as **aperture**: it grants the category “town” where no constitutive features obtain. Its multiplication is not secondary illustration but **primary mechanism**—a device that installs a site and then reproduces itself.

**Clip (DR2) — Dead River: the carried fire as transit device**  
`|| Only Yeller could keep a fire going on a journey through Dead River… the way they did this — some said — was by keeping a fire going in a clay canister Yeller passed among them as they traveled. ||`  
**Provenance:** Dead River · Travel testimony  
**Order(s):** Mediation & Aperture (device enabling passage)  
**Commentary (Philosophical):** A second aperture: a **canistered flame** mediates survival and movement. Passage is therefore a function of instrument, not of place—further evidence that devices, not geography, determine what is possible in Dead River.

## Main Content
**1) Device before place (Aperture).** The Archive’s Order of **Mediation & Aperture** names exactly this pattern: windows, carts, and other devices that constrain or enable access and authorship. Here the town’s existence is a function of a **map-device** that confers “town” and then proliferates copies. The filing should reflect mechanism-first rather than region-first.

**2) Multiplication without origin (Doubling).** The phrase “from that map, another… and from that one, ten” describes **recurrence without a stable original**. This aligns with the Archive’s Doubling cases (fivefold copies, silhouettes), where replication is the content and provenance cannot anchor interpretation.

**3) Region as secondary.** Minute 3.7 argued that “**geography is least falsifiable**; location endures.” In Dead River, location is **installed by a device**: where there is no river, the map furnishes a town; where there is no passage, the canistered flame furnishes a journey. Filing by Region as first mark would obscure the operative cause (aperture), misrepresenting evidence as geography.

**4) Comparative note (cart, window).** The Dead River map belongs beside the **Pickbox Cart** (authorless burden that mediates across boroughs) and the window cases (access control via apparatus). These are not “objects in places” but **devices that make places legible**—hence the proposed primary Order.

## Disposition
**Filed Without Action.** (Logged; committee declined to elevate device-first filing above Region for this case.)

## Cross-References
- **Phase I — [Minute 3.7 — “Provenance First”]({{ '/debate/phase1-minute-3-7/' | relative_url }})** — establishes geography as first mark; the Dead River materials directly test its rationale. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
