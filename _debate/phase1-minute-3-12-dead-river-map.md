## Abstract
Entered **Slip DR-02** to the **Dead River** regional drawer. The slip asserts the site’s town-status derives from a **map**, with subsequent **maps-of-maps**. Despite metaphysical irregularities, Phase I procedure requires Region-first filing.

## Minute

1) **Entry of Slip DR-02 (Dead River).**  
`|| The town of Dead River had nor river nor whores nor sheriff nor church… The town of Dead River could be called a town only because a map had named it. And from that map, another map, and from that one, ten. ||`

2) **Witness of record.**  
`|| The man’s name was Cole Sawyer Stump. ||`

3) **Rationale (Phase I).** Geography remains the **least falsifiable** first mark; we therefore seat this material in **Dead River** with a clerk’s caution that later Phases may revisit its mechanism (device-made town; maps that multiply).

4) **Filing instructions.**  
- Primary: **Region → Dead River** (Phase I standard)  
- Clerk’s note: Mark slip margin “map-installed site; recurrence” for later cross-indexing when Orders are authorized.
