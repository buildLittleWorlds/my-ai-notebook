# Field Report 17.2 — On the Dens Boundary vs. Testimony

**Session:** Boundary Subcommittee, Field Office South Ditch
**Recorder:** Archivist P. Lanver
**Date:** Year 17
**Status:** Entered with Objections

---

## Abstract

This report documents the instability of the Dens boundary as observed between Year 16 and Year 17. Ditch meters and stool testimonies no longer coincide. The contradiction demonstrates the insufficiency of **Region-first** filing and suggests the need for a new category — **Boundary** — to track edges that move.

## Exhibits

### Clip A — Ditch Meter Reading

|| “The ditch rose two hands overnight. The gauge shows Dens shrinking.” ||
Filed: *Dens · Measurement Log (South Ditch)*

### Clip B — Stool Testimony

|| “Dens is larger than last winter. We drink deeper in. The wilderness is farther out.” ||
Filed: *Dens · Tavern Stool Transcript*

### Clip C — Clerk’s Reconciliation Attempt

|| “Both statements sworn. The ditch is swollen and the speech is swollen. Each resizes the edge.” ||
Filed: *Dens · Clerk’s Margin Note*

---

## Findings

1. **Region is not stable.**
   If “Dens” were fixed geography, the ditch and the testimony would agree. Instead they contradict while each claims precision.

2. **Contradiction is repeatable.**
   This is not a clerical error. Over seven visits, the same divergence appeared: ditch gauges shrinking the town; stools swelling it.

3. **Boundary must be its own filing mark.**
   The content of these slips is not “Dens.” It is *the act of an edge shifting.*

---

## Commentary

The earlier doctrine (*Minute 3.7 — Provenance First*) insisted geography “endures.” This case proves otherwise. The geography itself is split: one world measured, another world spoken.

The margin note of Clerk Y. Sull captures the truth: *“Each resizes the edge.”* What we file is not the town, but the resizing.

---

## Proposed Filing

> **Order:** Boundary
> **Region:** Dens (secondary)
> **Form:** Field Report (meter log + testimony)

---

## Disposition

The Subcommittee thanked the field office and filed this report under “Dens.” The proposal to introduce “Boundary” as a category was tabled.

Margin annotation by Senior Clerk: *“A contradiction is still a place.”*
