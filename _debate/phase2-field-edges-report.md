**Session:** Boundary Subcommittee, Field Office South Ditch
**Recorder:** Archivist P. Lanver
**Date:** Year 17
**Status:** Entered with Objections

---

## Abstract

Field measurements logged. Dens boundary unstable. Ditch meters contradict stool testimony. Both recorded per Protocol. Regional filing insufficient. Boundary category proposed.

---

## Exhibits

### Clip A — Ditch Meter Reading

|| “The ditch rose two hands overnight. The gauge shows Dens shrinking.” ||
Filed: *Dens · Measurement Log (South Ditch)*

### Clip B — Stool Testimony

|| “Dens is larger than last winter. We drink deeper in. The wilderness is farther out.” ||
Filed: *Dens · Tavern Stool Transcript*

### Clip C — Clerk’s Reconciliation Attempt

|| “Both statements sworn. The ditch is swollen and the speech is swollen. Each resizes the edge.” ||
Filed: *Dens · Clerk’s Margin Note*

## Findings

1. **Region is not stable.**
   If “Dens” were fixed geography, the ditch and the testimony would agree. Instead they contradict while each claims precision.

2. **Contradiction is repeatable.**
   This is not a clerical error. Over seven visits, the same divergence appeared: ditch gauges shrinking the town; stools swelling it.

3. **Boundary must be its own filing mark.**
   The content of these slips is not “Dens.” It is *the act of an edge shifting.*

## Commentary

Minute 3.7 states geography "endures." Data contradicts. Two measurements recorded: ditch gauge, stool record. Both stamped, both contradictory. Filed per custody protocol.

Margin note by Clerk Y. Sull: *"Each resizes the edge."* Content logged: edge-shift, not location.

---

## Proposed Filing

> **Order:** Boundary
> **Region:** Dens (secondary)
> **Form:** Field Report (meter log + testimony)

---

## Disposition

The Subcommittee thanked the field office and filed this report under “Dens.” The proposal to introduce “Boundary” as a category was tabled.

Margin annotation by Senior Clerk: *“A contradiction is still a place.”*
