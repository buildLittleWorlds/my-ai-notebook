# Case Note 19.4 — On the Pickbox Cart and Authorless Burden

**Session:** Field Case Submission, North Annex Hearing Room
**Recorder:** Archivist C. Durn
**Date:** Year 19
**Status:** Logged; marked “unresolved”

---

## Abstract

A recurring slip concerns the **Pickbox Cart**: a wheeled burden that contains a house, tools, or maps, depending on testimony. Crucially, no witness agrees on who *authored* the cart. Some claim a mapmaker; others say it simply appeared. This case note records why filing by **Region** (Northo, Dead River, North Town) fails, and why the category of **Mediation & Aperture** is proposed.

## Exhibits

### Clip A — Northo Testimony

|| “A man with the cart wheeled past; he said it was a house folded into a box. We never saw him again, but the cart came back.” ||
Filed: *Northo · Roadside Transcript*

### Clip B — Dead River Account

|| “We lifted the lid. Inside was a second cart, smaller. Inside that, another. At the fifth, we stopped. The lids did not close again.” ||
Filed: *Dead River · Detour Ledger*

### Clip C — North Town Song

|| “The cart rolled without him. It killed two girls. The song says: pick, pick, pick, but no name sings with it.” ||
Filed: *North Town · Murder Song*

## Findings

1. **Authorship Absent.**
   Unlike a stool or a meter, the cart has no accepted maker. Filing by Region does nothing to resolve the vacuum.

2. **Cart as Aperture.**
   Each account treats the cart not as an object but as an *opening*: a house folded; boxes within boxes; violence spilling out.

3. **Mediation Across Regions.**
   The cart mediates between towns. It is not owned by Northo or Dead River but appears in both, carrying contents and contradictions alike.

## Irritation with Provenance Doctrine

Minute 3.7 insisted: “Archivists are not philosophers. We are custodians.” Yet here, custody collapses. No one possesses the cart, not even the Archive. To file it as “Northo” is to lie. To file it as “Dead River” is to lie differently.

---

## Proposed Filing

> **Order:** Mediation & Aperture
> **Regions:** Northo; Dead River; North Town
> **Form:** Case Note (composite testimonies)

---

## Disposition

Filed temporarily under *Northo* due to first witness. Cross-references to Dead River and North Town added in margin. The proposal for a primary “Mediation & Aperture” drawer was rejected by senior clerks as “philosophical.”

Margin note: *“The cart is merely a cart. File it where first seen.”*

## Closing Reflection

The cart’s lid is the Archive’s lid: every opening reveals another inside. To insist on a single geography is to force the lid shut. But the lids do not close.
