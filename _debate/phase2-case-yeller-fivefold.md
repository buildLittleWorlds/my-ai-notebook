## Abstract
The word **yeller** carries a private ledger. In North Town the singers name a bird, a girl, a bloom—and each name hides a wound. In Yeller Quarry the respectable commute into appetite and back again, washed and pressed. This note files **yeller** under **Violence & Secret Life**, with a cross-pull toward **Doubling**: fivefold signs that multiply meaning while erasing an origin.

## Exhibits

### Clip (N1) — North Town: the “yeller” stanza
`|| A yeller bird is a little flock of five. 
A yeller girl is a missing child. 
A yeller bloom is a promise made
Then broken. 
A superstition twitters in the shade. ||`  
*Filed:* North Town · Song/Poem Ledger

**Commentary (Romantic):** The stanza keeps two books: one public rhyme, one private confession. *Bird → five* (a number nesting in a name), *girl → missing* (harm under a color), *bloom → broken promise* (a bruise in a petal). The voice won’t say “violence”—it sings around it.

### Clip (Y1) — Yeller Quarry: the secret commute
`|| I’d known rich folk who’d moved to the Cap or even Mirado to be close enough to sneak away to Yeller Quarry, eat off greasy tables and get off on greasy thighs, and then drive back home to shower off and straighten out — worst case, pay someone else to straighten them out. ||`  
*Filed:* Yeller Quarry · Witness Account

**Commentary (Romantic):** Appetite with a driver’s license. Respectable routes detour through the Quarry; the ledger is written in grease, then laundered before morning. The harm ledger and the cleanliness ledger do not meet; they balance in secret.

*(Optional, noted in margin)*  
**Clip (Y2) — The window reunion**  
`|| A window on the third floor opened and my baby’s face poked out and called to me… ||`  
*Filed:* Yeller Quarry · Street Scene

**Commentary:** An aperture that returns a voice. Not all secrets end in harm—sometimes the ledger closes with a call and a descent. But the code *yeller* remains.

## Argument

**1) Fivefold code → Violence & Secret Life.**  
“Yeller” encodes a *five* that threads harm, promise, and superstition into one traveling sign. The Archive already counts murder songs and numerologies under **Violence & Secret Life**; this stanza belongs with those ledgers.

**2) Public melody / private confession.**  
The North stanza performs a double-shelving: a singable surface and an under-meaning the town already knows how to read. The Quarry witness shows the same doubleness as commute: desire enacted off-site, erased on return. This is **secret life** kept parallel to the public one.

**3) Doubling without origin.**  
The “flock of five” echoes the fivefold proliferations documented elsewhere (silhouette copies; boxes within boxes). Where is the *first* meaning of “yeller”? Nowhere we can find. **Doubling** acts as cross-Order here: recurrence is crisp; origins blur (cf. *Fivefold Silhouette Copies*).

**4) Why Region is secondary.**  
These slips travel between **North Town** and **Yeller Quarry**, with Capital/Mirado shadows on the rims. Filing by Region alone would scatter the kinship. Orders-first preserves the code as code (parallel ledgers of harm; fivefold recurrences), with Region retained as provenance.

## Disposition
**Filed Without Action.** (Logged; no change to primary drawers.)

## Cross-References
- **Phase II — [Colloquy Note 18.9 — On the Fivefold Silhouette Copies]({{ '/debate/phase2-colloquy-withdrawal/' | relative_url }})** — Doubling without origin (fivefold recurrences).  
- **Phase II — [Case Note 19.4 — On the Pickbox Cart and Authorless Burden]({{ '/debate/phase2-case-pickbox/' | relative_url }})** — violence line in North Town song; mediation across regions.
