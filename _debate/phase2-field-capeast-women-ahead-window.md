## Abstract

Capeast keeps the Cap’s habits but without the furniture to hide them. The morning after harvest, five women arrived without their supposed master, and the square tried to measure them before it met them. First came the window logic, then the wardrobe logic: slips may pass; bodies must negotiate tolerances. When the lights went out, the women crossed a line that paper had drawn—the city learned that an aperture without light is only wood.

## Exhibits

**Clip (C-E1) — Arrival before the owner**
`|| It was a festival night… the night after the festival of harvest… The mapmaker’s women arrived ahead of the mapmaker. ||`&#x20;
*Provenance:* Capeast · planning notes (harvest square)
*Commentary (Romantic):* The square was already sweeping itself straight when the seam turned up by itself: story not yet in town, practice already walking.

**Clip (C-E2) — Pattern, complaint, and choice**
`|| The mapmaker’s women were clothed in a pattern that shifted each time they were seen… covering up one breast on one of the women… a core circle… bare on their backs. ||`&#x20;
*Provenance:* Capeast · pattern log stub
*Commentary (Romantic):* The city speaks ordinance in fabric. When the women choose their own fittings, the paper hears offense and annotates desire as violation.

## Main Content/Argument

The night after a public joy always carries a broom. We logged the brooms first: benches righted; kegs walked back to corners that never wanted them; a warden rehearsing a paragraph to the steps as if the steps had applied for a permit. Then the women arrived without the cart. They stood, and the square stood around them, and the first document to form was not a welcome but a notice—cloth before consent.

Capeast does the Capital’s work by echo. The Capital installs a circle and says, “I speak through the window,” and the clerkly world agrees to be counted by apertures; Capeast installs the same circle in the square’s eyes. My note reads: *window inspector present without window; wooden ring carried like a threat.* When the inspector lifted the ring to frame a charge, we saw the grammar of mediation without the grace of it—aperture logic wandering the streets, searching for a wall to belong to. (See also the Debate standard that later fixed the ring to a ratio and called the drift by its name.)&#x20;

A local (sports-favored, Capeast to the bone) tripped the field lights at the bleachers and took the square briefly back to its old sense: bodies moving when the eye of record shut. In the dark the women crossed where the window would have been. Our file learns an old lesson twice: mediation is a device, not a mood; it needs power and a place. Without a wall, the circle is wood; without light, the rule is rumor.

By morning the mapmaker hauled in the after, as if ownership could arrive late and make a claim. It didn’t matter. The women had already written the docket with their steps. We recommend the Orders-first filing: primary **Mediation & Aperture**, with **Silence & Withdrawal** as cross-pressure (they did not speak, and their refusal to be routed through speech was the action); Regions secondary as provenance (Capeast square; Back Capital clerk). The Disposition follows from this: keep the contradiction visible—*cloth first / agency first*—and don’t choose. That is the testimony.

## Disposition

Filed Without Action.

**Notes for the file:**

* Keep the women’s arrival “ahead of the mapmaker” as the anchor contradiction (practice precedes author). Cross-index to Archive slip G1/G2 for corroborating extracts and apparel-complaint ledgers. &#x20;
* Treat Capital’s window regimen as the city’s doctrine of access (knowledge passes; bodies do not). Use it to frame Capeast’s copycat enforcement without fixtures.&#x20;
* Voice check: Romantic testimony is permitted in Debate (doc remains in-character; evidence-forward; contradictions preserved).&#x20;
