# Minute 3.7 — "Provenance First"

**Session:** Colloquy of Junior Archivists, Year 8
**Recorder:** Clerk A. Hessel (initialed “AH”)
**Status:** Adopted unanimously

---

## Opening

The Chair opened the discussion with the reminder that our responsibility is **custody**, not interpretation. The Archive must guarantee that every slip may be returned to its point of origin without dispute.

---

## Resolution

It was resolved that the Archive shall observe the principle of **Provenance First**. By this, we mean:

1. **Region** is the first mark: *Dens*, *Quarry*, *Dead River*, *North Town*, *Capital*, *Northo*, *Sticks*, *Tower*, *Capeast*.
2. **Form** is the second: slip, ledger, song, transcript, artifact, cart, device.
3. **Title** is the third: a concise designation sufficient for retrieval.

This triad will stand as the minimal ledger for any accession.

---

## Rationale

* **Geography is least falsifiable.** The place where a slip is received may be witnessed and signed. Content is debatable; *location endures*.
* **Witnesses contradict.** Testimony shifts from mouth to mouth, but the place of collection remains fixed.
* **Slips are porous.** Many slips contradict themselves. By filing under Region, we stabilize what can be stabilized.

---

## Examples Entered

* **Slip D-17 (Dens):** Stool testimony and ditch meter disagree. Filed to *Dens* nonetheless. Content to be sorted later.
* **Slip Q-09 (Quarry):** Fivefold silhouettes; authenticity uncertain. Filed to *Quarry* until provenance is otherwise challenged.
* **Slip DR-02 (Dead River):** Western detour fantasy, no second witness. Filed to *Dead River*.

## Closing Admonition

Archivists are not philosophers. We are custodians. Filing by Region keeps us honest. Theories of desire, doubling, or silence may come later. Without a fixed first mark, the Archive will collapse under its own contradictions.
