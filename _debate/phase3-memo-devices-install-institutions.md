## Abstract
In Dead River, **devices** do institutional work. A **library** and a **church** appear not as inherited endowments but as **apertures**—forms that *install* public life where ontology is thin. Their operation resembles the Capital’s windows and carts: mechanism first, site second. A cross-tag to **Craving** is warranted where the town’s appetite for *Necessity* becomes practice.

## Exhibits

**Clip (DR-L1) — The Crawford Library & its figure**
`|| Linnie… gave her husband the keys to the Crawford Library… In front of the library a sculpture… the hermit… contemplating rope, vial, pistol and ball… “Mr. Crawdead”… became the Dead River finger up the nose of time… ||`  
*Provenance:* Dead River · Library and public art ledger  
*Order(s):* Mediation & Aperture  
*Commentary (Philosophical):* The library is an **installed aperture** (keys hand over an institution), while the sculpture works as a **didactic device**—a public instrument teaching time and mortality. Neither depends on “what Dead River already is”; each *makes* a civic surface.

**Clip (DR-C1) — First church; the lure of Necessity**
`|| He became the town’s first minister… opening… the first church in Dead River… Opal… gained… an interest in the possibility of “invisible, logical, absolute Necessity.” ||`  
*Provenance:* Dead River · Founding of the church  
*Order(s):* Mediation & Aperture (institutional form); Craving (doctrinal appetite)  
*Commentary (Philosophical):* The church operates as a **form that grants access** to worship and record; Opal’s fixation names the **appetite** that such forms solicit and train.

## Main Content
**1) Institution as aperture.**  
In a town already “made” by a **map**, the library repeats the logic: keys formalize access; a sculpture instructs the public on how to look. The church likewise **opens** a channel to doctrine. These are not just *in* Dead River—they **produce** Dead River’s civic legibility.

**2) Craving as practice.**  
Opal’s “invisible, logical, absolute Necessity” is not a thesis; it is a *habit-forming desire*. The Archive should tag such doctrinal hungers under **Craving** when they shape behavior (attendance, speech, cataloging) rather than merely decorate belief.

**3) Standards consequence (Orders-first).**  
Because devices install the very **conditions of record**, filing by **Mediation & Aperture** as primary and **Region** as provenance clarifies cause. This memo extends the device logic established in other cases (carts, windows), recommending consistent treatment for **institutional devices** (library, church).

**4) Dead River’s chain of devices.**  
Map → Library → Church: a linked series where each device **creates** the next layer of public reality. The Archive should maintain a visible chain index for Dead River’s devices so later clerks can argue from mechanism rather than from place.

## Disposition
**Filed.** (Entered into Phase III Orders package; referenced in device/aperture standards discussion.)
