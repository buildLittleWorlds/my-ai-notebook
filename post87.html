            <h2>87 Summing Up the Series</h2>

            <p>The analytical thesis of this blog so far has been that the influence of Romantic ideas is much more pervasive than we typically acknowledge. By labeling "Romanticism" a historical period that ended in the 19th century, we blind ourselves to the ways in which its core assumptions continue to animate many of our contemporary debates. The modern boycott is an instructive example. The reason the conversation is often so intractable is that we are treating historically contingent ideas about art, ethics, and the self as if they are universal truths.</p>

            <p>The genealogical goal of this series was to make that intellectual lineage visible. The point was not to declare a "winner" between the Romantics and their critics but to bring out some old sources of what feel like our moral instincts. When we demand <a href="romantic-kit-authenticity.html">authenticity</a> from an artist, we're not appealing to a timeless virtue; we're re-enacting a specific revaluation of the self that was a project of the Romantic movement.</p>
            
            <p>This entire intellectual architecture (the elevation of <em>Gefühl</em>, the ideal of the <em>schöne Seele</em>, the hermeneutics of communion) was a coherent response to the challenges of its time. But it is an inheritance, not an inevitability. Hegel's critique demonstrated that this framework contained the seeds of its own pathology. The quest for absolute purity could collapse into judgmental inaction.</p>
            
            <p>It's also probably the case that more of these Romantic traces are out there. This seems like the thing I need to keep doing, looking for them and thinking about them.</p>

            <p>I'm pretty sure my <a href="post72.html"></a> Deleuze project will uncover a bunch more.</p>
