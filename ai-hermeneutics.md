## About the AI Hermeneutics Kit

This kit provides the theoretical and historical context for the central arguments of this blog. Its purpose is to show that the interpretive challenges posed by AI are not entirely new, but are intensifications of questions that the field of hermeneutics has been exploring for centuries.

The framework moves from theory to a practical method of reading, building a coherent approach to AI-generated texts.
