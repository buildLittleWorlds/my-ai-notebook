            <h2>48 A structuralist reading of the "Hero" video</h2>
            <p>Here's another reading of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg">"Hero"</a> music video. What if the video's meaning isn't controlled by the character's unified soul or his fractured psychology but by all the combined the systems speaking the artwork? What if the song and the video, as aesthetic forms, take off in ways that don't allow any intentional message to win out? This is the structuralist reading, the one that sees the "dance of symbols" (<a href="post43.html">Post 43</a>) in action.</p>

            <p>The video is a text where multiple autonomous systems are colliding. First, there's the visual system of the American cowboy myth. The video opens with grainy, archival footage of anonymous rodeo riders, building from a visual <a href="post23.html"><em>langue</em></a> before we even meet our protagonist. He is immediately slotted into this pre-existing system of signs; his meaning is partly generated by his relationship to the myth of The Cowboy before his personal story even begins.</p>
            
            <p>Then there's the formal system of the pop song. The song's narrative details in some ways are pretty bleak and ambiguous. The mother's weary face tells one story, the daughter's adoring one tells another, and the cowboy's transient life tells a third. A purely realistic telling would leave us in this state of unresolved tension. But this is a pop song, and the form has its own demands. At about the 1:48 mark (in the official version), the bridge arrives. The instrumentation swells, other voices from the band join in more with the lead singer, and the lyrics shift from personal refusal to a collective, mythic register.</p>

            <p>This is the system taking over. The musical form of a pop song requires a bridge that provides emotional release and transcendence. The song's internal logic demands an uplifting turn, and so it manufactures one, imposing a heroic arc that the realism of the story can't quite support. The triumphant feeling doesn't come from the character's resolution of his conflicts but from the chord changes and harmonies fulfilling their systemic function. The form generates an emotional meaning that overrides the content.</p>

            <p>From this perspective, the hero isn't a person at all but an effect generated by the machine of the song. And "song" here doesn't mean just the individual song ("Hero") but the form of the pop song as a collective thing in American and world history (<em>plus</em> the individual song "Hero" as a kind of overlay on top of that collective system). It's an illustration of an "autogenerative" system (<a href="post41.html">Post 41</a>) creating intricate patterns (in this case that feeling of heroism that really is in there somewhere in this song) whether or not the system of the song ever reaches out to the real historical world of rodeos, cowboys, real daughters with real divorced parents, real fathers dealing with real dead-end jobs, real mothers, etc.</p>
