            <h2>48 A structuralist reading of the "Hero" video</h2>
            
            <p>Here's another way to read the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg">"Hero"</a> music video. This is the structuralist reading. Systems are what matter here, not authenticity and not psychological complexity.</p>

            <p>The video is a text where multiple autonomous systems collide. First, there's the visual system of the American cowboy myth. The video opens with grainy, archival footage of anonymous rodeo riders. It's building from a visual <em>langue</em> before we even meet our protagonist. He gets slotted into this pre-existing system of signs. His meaning comes from his relationship to the myth of The Cowboy before his personal story even begins.</p>

            <p>Then there's the formal system of the pop song. The narrative details are pretty bleak and ambiguous. The mother's weary face tells a story. The daughter's adoring face tells another. The cowboy's transient life tells another. A purely realistic telling would leave us in unresolved tension. But this is a pop song. The form has its own demands. At about 1:48 (in the official version), the bridge arrives. The instrumentation swells, other voices join in more with the lead singer, and the lyrics shift from personal refusal to a collective, mythic register.</p>

            <p>This is the system taking over. The musical form of a pop song requires a bridge providing emotional release and transcendence. The song's internal logic demands an uplifting turn, so it manufactures one. It imposes a heroic arc the realism of the story can't quite support. The triumphant feeling doesn't come from the guy resolving his conflicts. It comes from the chord changes and harmonies fulfilling their systemic function. The form generates an emotional meaning overriding the content.</p>

            <p>From this angle, the hero isn't a person at all. It's an effect generated by the machine of the song. And "song" here doesn't mean the individual song ("Hero") but the form of the pop song as a collective thing in American and world history (plus the individual song "Hero" as an overlay on top of the collective system). It's an "autogenerative" system (<a href="post41.html">Post 41</a>) creating intricate patterns. In this case the feeling of heroism really is in there somewhere in this song. Whether or not the system of the song ever reaches out to the real historical world of rodeos, cowboys, real daughters with real divorced parents, real fathers dealing with real dead-end jobs, real mothers, etc.</p>
