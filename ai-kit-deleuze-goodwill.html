    <h1>The Unfriendly Philosopher: Deleuze's Rejection of Goodwill</h1>
    <p>The entire Romantic critique of AI—the anxiety about its lack of a soul or sincere intent—is built on a foundational assumption: that an author should be our friend. We expect a human writer to extend a "gesture of goodwill," to communicate clearly and honestly. This is the Whitman of <a href="post25.html">"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,"</a> who promises to be "with you" and "pour his meaning into you."</p>
    <p>Gilles Deleuze's philosophy begins by dynamiting this foundation. As Joe Hughes argues, Deleuze's work is a deliberate assault on the "postulate of goodwill." He is not a friendly guide; he is a "surly interlocutor" who writes with a "will to deceive." This is not a stylistic flaw; it is the core of his critical method.</p>

      <h2>Why Refuse Friendship?</h2>
      <p>Deleuze’s refusal of goodwill is a strategic attack on the unified subject. The "author" we think we are communing with is not a real presence, but a ghost we construct based on our own readerly expectations. We assume the writer wants to be understood, so we smooth over contradictions and search for a single, coherent intention.</p>
      <p>Deleuze's "unfriendly" style makes this impossible. By employing deception, ventriloquism, and radical shifts in meaning, he forces us to confront the fact that there is no stable, singular "Deleuze" behind the text. We are forced to abandon the search for a person and instead engage with the text as an impersonal machine that produces concepts.</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>The Romantic Reader</strong> seeks communion with a soul.</li>
          <li><strong>The Deleuzian Reader</strong> must map the functions of a textual machine.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>AI and the End of Goodwill</h2>
      <p>This provides a powerful new lens for AI. The standard critique is that an AI cannot be an author because it cannot offer genuine goodwill; it is the ultimate "bullshit machine" that mimics intimacy without sincerity. A Deleuzian reading flips this on its head.</p>
      <p>The AI’s lack of goodwill is not its failure, but its most philosophically interesting quality. It literalizes the condition of all writing. By having no "self" to befriend us with, it forces us out of the Romantic trap. It makes it impossible to pretend we are communing with a soul. We are left with what was always there: a linguistic system that generates patterns.</p>
      <p>The problem, for Deleuze, was never that a machine might one day learn to write. The problem was that philosophy had for centuries been acting as if the human author wasn't a kind of machine all along. By rejecting goodwill, Deleuze clears the ground for a philosophy that no longer needs the illusion of the unified subject—a philosophy prepared for a world of authorless texts.</p>
