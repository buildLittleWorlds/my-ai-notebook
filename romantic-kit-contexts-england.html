    <h1>Contexts: England (The Poetic Revolution)</h1>
    <p>English Romanticism translated the philosophical energy of Germany into a concrete poetic revolution. Centered on figures like William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the movement's formal beginning is often dated to their 1798 collaboration, <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>. Their work was shaped by the twin upheavals of the French and Industrial Revolutions.</p>

    <h3>Signature Ideas in Practice</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="Romantic-kit-authenticity.html">Authenticity</a> in Language and Subject:</strong> The program's core, laid out in Wordsworth’s "Preface to Lyrical Ballads," was a radical call for authenticity. It rejected neoclassical artifice in favor of "the very language of men" and found its subjects in the "common life," dignifying the experiences of rustic and marginalized people.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="Romantic-kit-organic-form.html">Organic Form</a> in Practice:</strong> Coleridge was the key conduit for German ideas on organicism. He argued that a poem's form must grow from within, like a plant, shaped by the "seminal principle" of the imagination. This rejected the "mechanic" application of classical rules and genres.</li>
      <li><strong>The Creative Imagination:</strong> For the English Romantics, the imagination was not mere fantasy. It was a powerful, truth-seeing faculty. Coleridge distinguished between the "primary imagination" (the active power of perception shared by all) and the "secondary imagination" (the artist's conscious power to dissolve, diffuse, and dissipate in order to recreate).</li>
      <li><strong>Nature as a Moral Force:</strong> In the face of growing industrialization, the English Romantics idealized nature as a source of spiritual truth, moral wisdom, and emotional restoration. Wordsworth’s poetry, in particular, explores the deep, sympathetic connection between the human mind and the natural world.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Wordsworth's ultimate ambition, as M. H. Abrams shows, was to write the great modern epic, a successor to Milton's <em>Paradise Lost</em>. But Wordsworth's epic would replace Milton's supernatural drama with a "natural supernaturalism." Its subject would not be the fall of man from heaven, but the growth of the poet's own mind. Its high argument would be the "spousal verse" celebrating the redemptive "marriage" between a creative mind and a living Nature, which together could create a paradise on earth, here and now. This project recast the entire Christian story into a personal, psychological, and natural framework.</p>

    <h3>The Social Horizon</h3>
    <p>The movement cannot be understood apart from its historical moment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Revolution and Disillusionment:</strong> The early Romantics were radical supporters of the French Revolution's ideals. Their later disillusionment with its violence and the rise of Napoleon turned their focus inward, toward the redemptive power of the individual mind and nature.</li>
        <li><strong>The "Mechanical Age":</strong> Reacting against Blake's "dark Satanic mills," Romantic poetry often positioned the <a href="Romantic-kit-technology-machine.html">pastoral and the wild</a> as a necessary refuge from the alienation of industrial city life.</li>
    </ul>
