      <h2>55 More Than Bullshit: The Soulless Chaos of the Machine</h2>
      <p>A powerful critique labels LLMs as "bullshit machines," indifferent to the truth. From a Romantic view, this is a charge of radical <a href="romantic-kit-authenticity.html">inauthenticity</a>. But this critique is too generous. It grants the machine a semblance of agency—the bullshitter, after all, has a purpose. The rigorous Romantic toolkit reveals a deeper, more damning truth.</p>
      <p>Friedrich Schlegel argued that a great work "aims at more than it knows," carrying <strong>unconscious meanings</strong>. He believed a text's "confusions" and contradictions were themselves meaningful, revealing the author's internal struggles.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> For a visionary like William Blake, art was a "Mental Fight," the struggle to give form to divine imagination.<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> Flaws and "confusions" in such a work are the scars of a noble battle. What happens when we apply this lens to AI?</p>

      <h3>From Bullshit to Chaos: An Example</h3>
      <p>Let's use our previous example: an AI prompted for a corporate statement on "innovation" produces text blending Silicon Valley jargon with agrarian metaphors ("planting the seeds of synergy," "harvesting disruptive ideas").</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The "bullshit" reading dismisses this as a meaningless, contradictory cliché.</li>
        <li>A <strong>Romantic hermeneutic reading</strong> sees something far worse. This is not "productive confusion." Schlegel's method sought the hidden depths of a <em>human</em> mind. Blake's art was a product of the "Divine Humanity."<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup> The AI's contradictions are not the sign of a struggling soul, but the meaningless output of a purely mechanical process. It is chaos, not unconscious meaning.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>The Critical Pivot: The Unconscious vs. The Unthinking</h3>
      <p>Here the Romantic method delivers its judgment. The "unconscious" of a human artist is a wellspring of vision, intuition, and buried truth. The process of an AI is unthinking. Its "confusions" reveal nothing but the statistical noise of its training data. They are accidents of the machine, not symbols from the soul.</p>
      <p>For Blake, who fought against the "dark Satanic Mills" of a mechanistic worldview, an AI's text would be the ultimate artifact of that satanic logic.<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> It is a system that mimics the form of creation without the divine spark of imagination that makes it sacred. The "bullshit" critique is a secular complaint. The Romantic critique is theological: the AI's output is not a flawed text to be interpreted, but a hollow idol, a profane imitation of the divine act of creation.</p>
