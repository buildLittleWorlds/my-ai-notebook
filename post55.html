<h2>55 More Than Bullshit: The Soulless Chaos of the Machine</h2>
<p>There's a pretty influential critique that labels LLMs as "bullshit machines," indifferent to the truth. From a Romantic view, this is a charge of radical <a href="romantic-kit-authenticity.html">inauthenticity</a>. But this critique is too generous. It grants the machine a semblance of agency. The bullshitter, after all, has a purpose. The rigorous Romantic toolkit reveals a deeper, more damning truth.</p>
<p>Friedrich Schlegel argued that a great work "aims at more than it knows," carrying <strong>unconscious meanings</strong>. He believed a text's "confusions" and contradictions were themselves meaningful, revealing the author's internal struggles.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> For a visionary like William Blake, art was a "Mental Fight," the struggle to give form to divine imagination.<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> Flaws and "confusions" in such a work are the scars of a noble battle. What happens when we apply this lens to AI?</p>

  <h3>From Bullshit to Chaos: An Example</h3>
  <p>Imagine an AI is prompted to generate a corporate statement about its new strategic plan. It produces the following:</p>
  <blockquote style="margin: 1em 2em; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
    <p>"To cultivate our Q3 strategic roadmap, we are planting the seeds of synergy across all departmental silos. By nurturing these emergent workflows with data-driven sunlight, we will soon harvest a bumper crop of disruptive innovation, ensuring a fruitful and scalable future."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The "bullshit" reading dismisses this as a meaningless, contradictory cliché.</li>
    <li>A <strong>Romantic hermeneutic reading</strong> sees something far worse. This is not "productive confusion." Schlegel's method sought the hidden depths of a <em>human</em> mind. Blake's art was a product of the "Divine Humanity."<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup> The AI's contradictions are not the sign of a struggling soul, but the meaningless output of a purely mechanical process. It is chaos,<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup> not unconscious meaning.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Furthermore, Schlegel's ideal work was a <em>Roman</em>, a "Mischgedicht" where different genres and styles were fused by a singular, unifying vision. The 'confusions' in such a work are the signs of a human mind struggling to synthesize this totality. An AI's output, however, is also a "Mischgedicht"—a statistical blend of the myriad genres in its training data—but it is a mixture without a unifying purpose. This understanding of the <em>Roman</em> as a 'mixed genre' is central to Schlegel's thought.<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup> Its contradictions are not scars from a 'Mental Fight,' but the meaningless seams of a purely mechanical process.</p>

  <h3>The Critical Pivot: The Unconscious vs. The Unthinking</h3>
  <p>Here the Romantic method delivers its judgment. The "unconscious" of a human artist is a wellspring of vision, intuition, and buried truth. The process of an AI is unthinking. Its "confusions" reveal nothing but the statistical noise of its training data. They are accidents of the machine, not symbols from the soul.</p>
  <p>For Blake, who fought against the "dark Satanic Mills" of a mechanistic worldview, an AI's text would be the ultimate artifact of that satanic logic.<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> It is a system that mimics the form of creation without the divine spark of imagination that makes it sacred. The "bullshit" critique is a secular complaint. The Romantic critique is theological: the AI's output is not a flawed text to be interpreted, but a hollow idol, a profane imitation of the divine act of creation.</p>
