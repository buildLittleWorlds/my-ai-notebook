German Romanticism, particularly the circle in Jena, was the
intellectual crucible of the movement. More than a literary style, it
was a philosophical revolution that sought to fuse poetry with theory,
art with science, and life with thought. It provided the rigorous
concepts that would be adapted and transformed across Europe.

### Signature Ideas

- **A New Critical Program:** A core project of the German Romantics,
  particularly the Schlegel brothers, was to transform the meaning of
  the word *romantisch*. As René Wellek has shown, they took a term that
  historically referred to medieval romances (like those of Ariosto and
  Cervantes) and repurposed it into a conscious, polemical, and
  philosophical program. "Romantic" became the banner for a new kind of
  art defined in opposition to the rules and constraints of
  Neoclassicism.<sup>[2](#ref2)</sup>
- **The Fusion of Everything:** The central project, articulated by
  Friedrich Schlegel, was "progressive universal poetry." A dynamic,
  infinitely expandable form of art that could absorb philosophy,
  criticism, and mythology. A key influence on Schlegel was Johann
  Gottfried Herder, who saw the *Roman* (a term encompassing not just
  the modern novel but also medieval romances and even Shakespeare's
  plays) as the representative genre of the post-classical era. Herder
  characterized the *Roman* by its "Mischung" (mixture) of genres.
  Schlegel adopted and radicalized this idea, seeing the *Roman* as the
  ultimate "Mischgedicht" (mixed genre) destined to synthesize all other
  forms of poetry, philosophy, and criticism into a new, living
  whole.<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>
- **[Organic Unity]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-organic-form/' | relative_url }}) as Metaphysics:**
  Friedrich Schelling’s *Naturphilosophie* gave philosophical weight to
  the organic metaphor. It argued that nature and mind were two sides of
  the same living, creative reality, providing a basis for theories of
  organic form in art.
- **Romantic Irony:** A sophisticated concept where a work of art
  demonstrates self-awareness. The author can signal their detachment
  from their own creation, acknowledging its limits and opening it to
  endless interpretation. It is a mark of artistic freedom and
  intellectual agility.
- **The Primacy of the Aesthetic:** For the German Romantics, art was
  not mere decoration; it was the highest form of knowledge. They
  believed that new forms like "Romantic poetry" were the only language
  capable of expressing the ineffable *Gefühl* (feeling), which they
  believed granted access to the infinite reality that rational
  discourse could not capture.

This philosophical project was a grand act of ["natural
supernaturalism."]({{ '/kits/romantic-kit-technology-machine/' | relative_url }}) Thinkers like
Schiller and Hegel took the Biblical plot of Creation, Fall, and
Redemption and translated it into a secular, philosophical history of
consciousness. The fall from Eden became the mind's necessary fall into
self-awareness and division. The final Apocalypse was reimagined as the
mind's achievement of a higher, self-conscious unity through reason and
art. This provided the essential blueprint for the ["circuitous
journey"](https://victorianweb.org/religion/apocalypse/dungey.html) that
would define the Romantic era.

### Key Forms & Figures

The movement's philosophical aims were reflected in its experimental
forms.

- **The Fragment:** Used by the Schlegel brothers and Novalis, the
  aphoristic fragment was a deliberate choice. It presented insights as
  incomplete and provocative, inviting the reader into a collaborative
  process of thought rather than presenting a closed system. The
  fragment stimulates the reader's own *Gefühl* rather than simply
  describing the author's, making the act of reading a participatory and
  creative process.
- **Key Figures:** Friedrich and August Wilhelm Schlegel (the
  theorists), Novalis (the visionary poet), Friedrich Schelling (the
  philosopher), and Friedrich Schleiermacher (the theologian and
  hermeneuticist).
