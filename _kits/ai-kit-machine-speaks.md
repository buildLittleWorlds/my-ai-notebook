When Heidegger declared that “language speaks,” he meant that language
discloses our being-in-the-world beyond any one speaker’s intent.
AI-generated text radicalizes this intuition: sequences of words appear
without a human author at the origin. What are the philosophical
implications of this new form of “speech”?

## Language Without Life: The Ontological Question

Traditional philosophy of language assumed that meaningful utterance
presupposes a living subject. AI texts challenge this assumption at its
foundation.

### What Is AI “Speech”?

- **Statistical patterning:** Algorithms predict the most likely next
  token based on vast textual corpora.
- **Iterability:** Outputs function in the absence of a sender or
  receiver—Derrida’s point made concrete.
- **Paratextual scaffolding:** Prompts, system messages, and UI
  disclosures frame how we receive this “speech.”

## Two Dangers, Two Opportunities

- **Danger—Enframing (*Gestell*):** Language reduced to instrument;
  “idle talk” amplified.
- **Danger—Anthropomorphism:** Confusing fluent sequence for human
  consciousness.
- **Opportunity—Clarification:** Seeing how meaning can emerge from
  structure, reception, and use—without an author.
- **Opportunity—Reflexivity:** Making explicit the paratexts and
  readerly labor that always shaped understanding.

## Reading Without Authors

For practical reading strategies, connect this page to two lenses:

1.  **Reception & Form Diagnostics:** a hands-on method using [reception
    (Jauss), reader-response (Iser), and narratology/paratexts
    (Genette)]({{ '/kits/ai-kit-forensics/' | relative_url }}).
2.  **Genealogy (Reception & Narratology):** see how [Jauss, Iser,
    Genette]({{ '/kits/ai-kit-genealogy/' | relative_url }}) sit alongside Gadamer, Ricoeur,
    Heidegger, Derrida.
