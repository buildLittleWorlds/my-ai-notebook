## How to use this

This kit provides the theoretical and historical context for the central
arguments of this blog. Its purpose is to show that the interpretive
challenges posed by AI are not entirely new, but are intensifications of
questions that the field of hermeneutics has been exploring for
centuries. The pages are designed to build a coherent framework, moving
from theory to a practical method of reading.
