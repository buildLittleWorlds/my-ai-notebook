In 1967, Roland Barthes declared the “death of the author.” With AI,
that metaphor becomes literal: many texts arrive without a human author
at all. What follows is a field guide for reading without authors.

## Why This Matters

- **Authorship collapses:** There is no psyche to recover; no
  “intentional fallacy”—there’s often no intention.
- **Interpretive ground shifts:** We lean more on *text/form* and
  *reader reception* than on biography.
- **Ethics stays central:** Even without an author, readings answer to
  communities and consequences.

### Three Theoretical Positions

#### 1. The Purists (Meaning Requires Consciousness)

Following **Schleiermacher** (and in spirit, **Dilthey**), this view
holds that interpretation aims to recover a living mind. With AI, that
rail fails: there is no author to reconstruct.

#### 2. The Structuralists / Post-Structuralists (Meaning Lives in Language)

Following **Barthes** and **Derrida**, meaning is a function of language
and difference; authorial presence is optional. AI exemplifies writing
that works “in the radical absence of a sender.”

#### 3. The Reader/Form Pragmatists

Following **Jauss**, **Iser**, and **Genette**, interpretation pivots to
readers and structure: horizons of expectation, implied readers and
gaps, and narratological/paratextual organization.

## How to Read Post-Authorial Texts (Five Moves)

1.  **Audit the paratexts (Genette):** Look at prompts, system messages,
    disclaimers, titles, UI affordances—thresholds that steer
    interpretation.
2.  **Map narrative structure (Genette):** Order, duration, frequency;
    mood/focalization; voice.
3.  **Engage the implied reader (Iser):** What gaps does the text stage?
    What completions does it solicit?
4.  **Situate reception (Jauss):** What horizon of expectations do
    communities bring? How does the text shift those horizons?
5.  **Apply ethically (Augustine/Ricoeur):** Favor readings that build
    truth/charity and disclose a livable “world of the text.”

### Examples (Sketches)

- **Model card as paratext:** Safety warnings and capability notes frame
  what you expect from outputs.
- **Prompt as narrator:** A first-person prompt sets *voice* distinct
  from any human author.
- **LLM “gaps”:** Hallucinated placeholders and generic frames function
  as *Leerstellen* soliciting reader completion.
