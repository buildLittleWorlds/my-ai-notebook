The most common Romantic objection to AI is that there is "no one
there." We assume a human author is a stable, unified subject who exists
before the act of writing. Judith Butler's philosophy, particularly in
*Gender Trouble*, gives us a radical challenge to this idea. She argues
that the subject is not the cause of an act, but its effect. This
reframes the entire problem of AI authorship.

## There Is No "Doer Behind the Deed"

Drawing on Nietzsche, Butler argues that we mistakenly invent a stable
"subject" as the cause of various actions. We see a series of gendered
acts and invent a "gender identity" as their origin. But this is a
grammatical illusion. As she famously puts it, "There is no gender
identity behind the expressions of gender; that identity is
performatively constituted by the 'expressions' that are said to be its
results."

The "doer" is a fiction produced by the "deed." The subject does not
precede the performance; the subject is an effect of the performance.

## AI as the Ultimate Performative Author

This is where AI becomes an interesting philosophical case study. An LLM
performs the act of writing (the "deed") perfectly, but without any
pre-existing "doer" or "author" behind it. The Romantic critic sees this
as AI's fundamental failure. A Butlerian reading sees it as the
literalization of the condition of all authorship.

- **The Romantic View:** A human author has a soul (doer) that produces
  a text (deed). An AI produces a text (deed) without a soul (doer), so
  it is inauthentic.
- **The Butlerian View:** The human "author" is also a fiction, a stable
  identity performatively constituted by the repeated act of writing.
  The AI, by generating the deed without the doer, simply exposes the
  mechanism that was at work all along.

The anxiety that there is "no one there" when we read an AI text is,
from this perspective, a moment of profound insight. It's the moment we
realize that the "someone" we thought was there in a human text was also
a constructed effect, a performance we had learned to believe in. AI
doesn't fail to be an author; it reveals authorship itself to be a
sustained, and ultimately unstable, performance.
