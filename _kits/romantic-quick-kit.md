## How to use this

The concepts in this kit are interconnected. Many Romantic writers and
thinkers shared a central story: a journey that begins in a state of
primal unity, falls into a painful state of division and alienation, and
concludes by returning home to a higher, more self-aware state of
integration. Think of it as a great circle or spiral. The pages below
explore the key features of this journey.

- Use the Hermeneutics page as your reading method; the other pages are
  what to look for as you read.
- Every page links out to sources you can look into further.
