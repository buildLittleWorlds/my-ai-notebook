The Romantic worldview is built on a fundamental distinction between an
authentic "inner" self and a potentially deceptive "outer" appearance.
Sincerity is the act of making the outside a true expression of the
inside. The charge that AI is "bullshit" or "inauthentic" is a defense
of this inner sanctum. But what if that "inner core" is itself an
illusion produced on the surface?

## The "Internal Core" as a Surface Effect

Judith Butler argues that what we take to be our deepest, most internal
self (like gender identity) is actually a fabrication. It is an "effect
of an internal core or substance" that is produced "*on the surface* of
the body, through the play of signifying absences that suggest, but
never reveal, the organizing principle of identity as a cause."

In simpler terms, our "soul" or "authentic self" is not something we
have, but something we do. It's a performance so convincing that we come
to believe it is our essence. The "inside" is an effect of the
"outside."

## AI and the Mass Production of Sincerity

This is precisely why AI is so unsettling. An LLM is a machine with no
"inside." It is all surface, a system for manipulating signs. Yet, it
can be prompted to produce texts that are emotionally resonant,
seemingly sincere, and full of apparent depth. Yuval Noah Harari fears
this as the ["mass-production of intimacy."](post32.html) A Butlerian
analysis sees it as something more fundamental: the mass production of
the signs of interiority.

- **The Romantic Fear:** AI can mimic the expressions of a soul without
  having one. This is a profound deception.
- **The Butlerian Insight:** AI's ability to generate a convincing
  "inner life" from the outside-in reveals that our own "inner life" is
  also constructed through a set of external, social performances.

AI doesn't lie about having a soul. It simply demonstrates that "having
a soul" is, at least in language, a learnable set of conventions, a
stylistic performance. The machine's lack of an authentic interior is
not its failure. It is a mirror that reveals the fabricated nature of
our own.
