            <h2>25 Crossing Brooklyn Ferry</h2>
            <p>I keep coming back to the same question: What is it we're afraid of losing? When people talk about the "soul of art" or the "human spark," what do they actually mean? The vocabulary often feels vague, more like a gut feeling than an argument. But there's one piece of writing that I think makes the case better than any essay: <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45470/crossing-brooklyn-ferry">Walt Whitman's "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry.</a>"</p>

            <p>The poem is a direct address to us, his future readers. From the very beginning, he makes a radical promise. He's not just describing a scene; he's claiming to be with us, right now:</p>

            <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
                <p>And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>How can he make this claim? He grounds it not in some abstract philosophy, but in the body and the senses. This is the first pillar of the Romantic worldview: the connection is real because the experience is shared and authentic. He builds a bridge between his body and ours, insisting that the fundamentals of perception and feeling are the same. "Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt," he writes. He lists the sensory details: the sea-gulls, the ships, the sunset, the "shimmering track of beams." Proof that his experience and ours are fundamentally interchangeable. He had a body, we have a body, and the world acts upon them in the same way. This shared, lived experience is the foundation of the contract between him and us.</p>

            <p>But from that physical foundation, he makes a spiritual leap. The poem's central miracle is the claim that this shared experience dissolves time and space. This is the second pillar: the power of the singular, transcendent human soul. He says it plainly:</p>

            <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
                <p>It avails not, time nor placeâ€”distance avails not,<br>I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generations hence...</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This is the "human spark" people are talking about. It's the belief that a text is not just a collection of words, but a vessel for a human presence. When we read, we are in communion with an actual person, a unique consciousness who "consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born." For Whitman, the poem is a technology that allows his soul to achieve a kind of immortality and be present with us now.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, he tells us what the purpose of this connection is. It's not just to see what he saw, but to receive something from him. "What is it then between us?" he asks. His answer is that he "fuses me into you, and pours my meaning into you." This is the core of the Romantic idea of the author. The author is not just a skilled arranger of words; he is a source, a presence who imparts something of his essential self to the reader. His "meaning." The text is the medium for this deeply personal, almost sacred, act of transmission.</p>

            <p>This is the worldview that feels most threatened by AI. "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry" is the perfect articulation of everything people believe an AI cannot do. An AI has no body, no lived experience on the ferry. It has no singular soul to transcend time. And it has no authentic "meaning" of its own to pour into a reader. The whole Romantic argument against AI is that it offers the form of art without the human presence that gives it life. It gives us a ferry, a river, a sunset, but on the other end, there is no one there.</p>
