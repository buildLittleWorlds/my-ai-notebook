            <h2>72 Professor Plate's Capstone Project (a plan)</h2>
            
            <h3>Part I: The Project: Goal and Sources</h3>

            <h4>A. The Central Analogy and My Goal</h4>
            
            <p><strong>My Goal:</strong> To use the contemporary, concrete act of AI data poisoning (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTqlSunIolI&t=3s">here's just one example of many videos about this</a>) as a master analogy to unlock the challenging but profound philosophical project of Gilles Deleuze.</p>

            <p>All of this popped into my mind while reading <em>Philosophy After Deleuze</em> by Joe Hughes and remembering things I've seen about data poisoning. I think there's an interesting parallel between what the data poisoners see themselves as doing and what Deleuze thinks the creative thinker or philosopher is doing in modern societies.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Power of the Analogy:</strong> Deleuze's method can seem abstract and intentionally obscure. This analogy provides a powerful, tangible key by grounding his strategies in a real-world conflict with clear tactics and ethical stakes.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Shared Target:</strong> Both the digital artist and Deleuze target a system that operates through <strong>recognition and reproduction</strong>. The AI model scrapes and reproduces existing artistic styles; traditional philosophy, in Deleuze's view, reproduces "common sense" and recognizes ideas only by comparing them to what is already known. Both are closed systems that resist genuine novelty.</li>
                <li><strong>The Shared Tactic: Subversion from Within.</strong> Neither the artist nor Deleuze attacks from the outside. They practice a form of "poisoning" that uses the system's own logic against it. The artist creates a "Trojan Horse," an image that looks appealing to the AI scraper but contains hidden data designed to corrupt it. Similarly, Deleuze performs "ventriloquism," inhabiting the language of another philosopher (like Kant or Spinoza) only to introduce a "monstrous" difference that corrupts the traditional understanding from within.</li>
                <li><strong>The Shared Outcome: Generative Failure.</strong> The goal is not a system crash but a <strong>generative failure</strong>. The poisoned AI, when prompted, produces "pure mush," a monstrous, useless creation. Deleuze's readings produce a "monstrous offspring," a concept that is no longer purely Kantian or Spinozist, but a new tool that forces the philosophical system to produce something it wasn't designed for. In both cases, the system's reproductive capacity is turned against itself to create a testament to its own internal corruption.</li>
                <li><strong>The Ethical Motive:</strong> This is not nihilism. The artist's "vendetta" is an ethical defense of human creativity against automated extraction ("stolen labor"). Deleuze's project is equally affirmative: it is a defense of vital, creative thinking against a "dogmatic image of thought" that he believes impoverishes life. The "poison" is a necessary act of clearing space for <strong>new, more powerful, and more joyful possibilities of life.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>By keeping this analogy in mind, Deleuze's most difficult concepts become strategic maneuvers in a creative and ethical war against reactive, cliché-ridden thought.</p>

            <h4>B. The Primary Texts</h4>
            
            <p>This plan draws from the two key Deleuzian texts cited and analyzed by Joe Hughes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Nietzsche and Philosophy</em> (1962)
                    <p><strong>Role in this Plan:</strong> This is the book of <strong>motive and method</strong>. It is Deleuze's most direct and passionate statement of his ethical project. It clearly lays out the critical tools (genealogy, active vs. reactive) and the ultimate goal: to liberate thought so it can affirm life and create new values. It is the best starting point for understanding <em>why</em> Deleuze does what he does.</p>
                </li>
                <li><em>Difference and Repetition</em> (1968)
                    <p><strong>Role in this Plan:</strong> This is Deleuze's magnum opus, the book of <strong>systematic critique and ontology</strong>. It contains the deep, technical deconstruction of the "dogmatic image of thought"—the system he seeks to poison. It details the mechanisms of representation he is fighting against and lays the groundwork for a new philosophy based on difference in itself, not difference subordinated to identity.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Part II: The Intermediate Plan: A Curated Tour of 48 Passages</h3>

            <p>Before reading the books in their entirety, this sequence of passages will provide me with a conceptual scaffolding. It is organized into a five-part narrative that mirrors the logic of Deleuze's project.</p>

            <h4>Section 1: Diagnosing the Problem: The Dogmatic Image of Thought</h4>
            <p><em>(We begin by identifying the target—the established system of thought that operates on unexamined presuppositions.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>1. The Presupposition of a Good Will in Thinking</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"According to this image, thought has an affinity with the true; it formally possesses the true and materially wants the true. It is in terms of this image that everybody knows and is presumed to know what it means to think."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 131</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> This is the foundational assumption of traditional philosophy. Hughes identifies this postulate of "Goodwill" as Deleuze's primary target, which his adversarial style is designed to overturn.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Recognition as the Model of Thought</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Recognition may be defined by the harmonious exercise of all the faculties upon a supposed same object... It is the common sense become philosophical."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 133</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Deleuze argues that philosophy mistakes simple recognition for genuine thinking. This model, which presupposes a stable subject recognizing a stable object, can never produce anything new. It is the AI model's logic of pattern-matching.</p>

            <p><strong>3. The True Enemy of Thought: Stupidity, Not Error</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Stupidity is a structure of thought as such... Stupidity is not error or a tissue of errors. There are imbecile thoughts, imbecile discourses, that are made up entirely of truths; but these truths are base, they are those of a base, heavy and leaden soul."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 105</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The "poisoning" is not aimed at correcting mere falsehoods. It targets <em>bêtise</em> (stupidity)—a way of thinking that can be factually correct but is creatively and ethically impotent.</p>

            <p><strong>4. The Genesis of Real Thinking: The Violent Encounter</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Something in the world forces us to think. This something is an object not of recognition but of a fundamental encounter... Thought is primarily trespass and violence, the enemy, and nothing presupposes philosophy: everything begins with misosophy."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 139</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> This is Deleuze's alternative. True thinking is involuntary, forced upon us by a "violent encounter" with something we <em>cannot</em> recognize. This is the conceptual "poison" that breaks our cognitive habits.</p>

            <h4>Section 2: Forging the Weapons: Style and Method</h4>
            <p><em>(Having identified the target, Deleuze fashions his tools. His method is one of active interpretation and creative combat.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>5. Philosophy with a Hammer</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The philosophy of sense and values had to be a critique... the only way in which a total critique may be realised, the only way to 'philosophise with a hammer'."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 1</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Deleuze's project is not a gentle inquiry but a forceful, active critique. The "hammer" is a diagnostic tool used to test the soundness of philosophical concepts, to see if they are hollow or full of life.</p>
            
            <p><strong>6. The Philosopher as Physician and Symptomatologist</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The whole of philosophy is a symptomatology, and a semeiology. The sciences are a symptomatological and semeiological system."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 3</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The philosopher's role is to diagnose the health or sickness of a culture by interpreting its concepts as "symptoms" of underlying forces.</p>
            
            <p><strong>7. Critique as Positive Creation</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Genealogy means both the value of origin and the origin of values... But, understood in this way, critique is also at its most positive. The differential element is both a critique of the value of values and the positive element of a creation."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 2</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Critique is not merely negative. For Deleuze, to critique a value is to trace it back to its origin and, in doing so, to create a new way of evaluating.</p>

            <p><strong>8. The New Question: Not "What is?" but "Which one?"</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The question 'which one?' (qui) means this: what are the forces which take hold of a given thing, what is the will that possesses it? Which one is expressed, manifested and even hidden in it? We are led to essence only by the question: which one?"</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, pp. 3, 77</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> This is the fundamental question of genealogy. It shifts philosophy from a search for abstract, timeless essences ("What is Truth?") to a concrete diagnosis of the forces at play in any given thing ("Which will seeks truth?").</p>

            <p><strong>9. Philosophy as Attack, Not Revenge</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Critique is not a re-action of <em>ressentiment</em> but the active expression of an active mode of existence; attack and not revenge, the natural aggression of a way of being..."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 3</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> This clarifies the motive. The destructive aspect of his method is an "attack" born from an overflowing, affirmative force, not the spiteful "revenge" of a reactive one.</p>

            <p><strong>10. The History of Philosophy as Theatre</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"In the history of philosophy, a commentary should act as a veritable double and bear the maximal modification appropriate to a double. (One imagines a philosophically bearded Hegel, a philosophically clean-shaven Marx...)"</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. xxi (Preface)</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Hughes's concept of "ventriloquism" comes directly from this idea. Deleuze treats past philosophers as masks or characters through which he can create a new, "monstrous" philosophical performance.</p>

            <p><strong>11. Pluralism as the Core of Philosophy</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Pluralism (otherwise known as empiricism) is almost indistinguishable from philosophy itself... the only principle of a violent atheism."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 4</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Deleuze rejects any philosophy based on the "One" or the "Same." His world is a multiplicity of forces and perspectives, which is why he must attack any system that claims a single, unifying Truth.</p>

            <p><strong>12. The Inversion of Platonism</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Overturning Platonism, then, means denying the primacy of original over copy, of model over image; glorifying the reign of simulacra and reflections."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 67</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The ultimate goal of his method is to dismantle the hierarchy that privileges a "true" world of models over our world of appearances. He champions the "simulacrum" (the copy without an original) as a site of creative power.</p>

            <h4>Section 3: The Diagnostic Tools: Active vs. Reactive and <em>Ressentiment</em></h4>
            <p><em>(Here are the core concepts Deleuze uses to analyze the forces at play in morality, culture, and thought itself.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>13. The Body and Its Forces</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"What defines a body is this relation between dominant and dominated forces... In a body the superior or dominant forces are known as active and the inferior or dominated forces are known as reactive."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 40</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> This is the foundation of his analysis. Everything is a composition of forces, and the first task is to evaluate the quality—active or reactive—of these forces.</p>

            <p><strong>14. Active Force Affirms Difference</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"In its relation with the other the force which makes itself obeyed does not deny the other... it affirms its own difference and enjoys this difference."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, pp. 8-9</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Active forces are the forces of creation. They act from their own power and affirm what they are. Their "aggression" is a consequence of their affirmation.</p>

            <p><strong>15. Reactive Force and the Triumph of the Weak</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Reactive forces do not become active but, on the contrary, they make active forces join them and become reactive in a new sense... they separate active force from what it can do."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 57</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> This is the poisoning mechanism of reactive forces. They don't win by becoming stronger; they win by making the strong "sick"—by separating them from their own power.</p>

            <p><strong>16. <em>Ressentiment</em>: The Engine of Slave Morality</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The slave morality from the outset says No to what is 'outside', what is 'different' what is 'not itself' and this No is its creative deed."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 10</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> <em>Ressentiment</em> is the psychological state of reactive forces. It is a logic that begins with negation ("You are evil, therefore I am good") and needs an external enemy to define itself.</p>

            <p><strong>17. The Passive Synthesis of Habit</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Time is constituted only in the originary synthesis which operates on the repetition of instants. This synthesis contracts the successive independent instants into one another, thereby constituting the lived, or living, present."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 70</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> This is the unconscious machinery of thought. Before any active recognition, our minds are already passively contracting time and forming habits. This is the deep, cellular level at which "poisoning" can be most effective.</p>

            <p><strong>18. The Dissolved Self</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Selves are larval subjects; the world of passive syntheses constitutes the system of the self... but it is the system of a dissolved self."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 73</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The unified "I" is an illusion. We are composed of thousands of passive, "larval" selves. This deconstruction of the subject is crucial for escaping the "dogmatic image of thought."</p>

            <p><strong>19. The Paradox of Learning</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"We never know in advance how someone will learn... Method is the means of that knowledge which regulates the collaboration of all the faculties... Culture, however, is an involuntary adventure."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 165</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> True learning is not methodical. It is an "involuntary adventure" sparked by an encounter that forces us to think.</p>
            
            <h4>Section 4: The Creative Core: Will to Power and Ideas</h4>
            <p><em>(This is Deleuze's positive alternative. He redefines Will to Power as a creative force and Ideas as problematic structures, not stable concepts.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>20. Will to Power Is NOT the Desire for Power</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Power is therefore not what the will wants, but on the contrary, the one that wants in the will."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. xi (Preface)</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The most crucial redefinition. Will to Power is not a psychological drive for domination but the ontological principle of difference itself.</p>

            <p><strong>21. Will to Power as a "Plastic Principle"</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The will to power... is an essentially plastic principle that is no wider than what it conditions, that changes itself with the conditioned..."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 50</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Will to Power is an immanent, not transcendent, principle. It is plastic and adapts to every situation.</p>

            <p><strong>22. Will to Power as Genetic Element</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The will to power is the genealogical element of force, both differential and genetic."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 50</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The technical definition. Will to Power is the deep structure that generates the differences between forces and their qualities.</p>

            <p><strong>23. The Will to Power Gives, It Does Not Take</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"In this way the will to power is essentially creative and giving: it does not aspire... it does not desire power. It gives..."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 85</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> This completes the redefinition. The Will to Power is a principle of generosity, an overflowing force that bestows sense and value.</p>

            <p><strong>24. Ideas as Problems, Not Solutions</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Problems are the differential elements in thought, the genetic elements in the true. We can therefore substitute for the simple point of view of conditioning a point of view of effective genesis."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 162</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Deleuze redefines Ideas not as stable concepts or answers, but as problematic structures. Real thought happens when we engage with the problem itself, not just search for a pre-packaged solution.</p>

            <p><strong>25. Ideas and the Unconscious</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Problems-Ideas are by nature unconscious: they are extra-propositional and sub-representative..."</em><br>— Conclusion, p. 267</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Ideas are not things we consciously possess. They are the unconscious, virtual structures that generate thought.</p>

            <h4>Section 5: The Ultimate Test and Goal: Eternal Return and Affirmation</h4>
            <p><em>(The entire project culminates in an ethical vision. The Eternal Return is the selective test for an affirmative life, and the Overman is the figure capable of living it.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>26. The Eternal Return as a Selective Thought</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Whatever you will, will it in such a way that you also will its eternal return."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 68</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The Eternal Return is not a fact but an ethical rule. It is a selective principle that filters out all half-willed, reactive actions.</p>

            <p><strong>27. The Eternal Return Selects Being</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Only action and affirmation return... The negative... the reactive... do not return because they are the opposite of becoming..."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, pp. xi-xii (Preface)</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The test is also ontological. Only that which is active and affirmative is worthy of being, and capable of "returning."</p>

            <p><strong>28. The Game of the Dicethrow</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The dice which are thrown once are the affirmation of chance, the combination which they form on falling is the affirmation of necessity."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, pp. 25-26</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The central metaphor for the creative act. It is a single throw that affirms all of chance in order to create a new necessity.</p>

            <p><strong>29. The Tragic is Joyful</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"According to Nietzsche it has never been understood that the tragic = the joyful... The dicethrow is tragic."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 36</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Tragedy is not about suffering, but the joy of affirming chance and necessity. It is the ethic of the creator.</p>
            
            <p><strong>30. To Will = To Create</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The glad tidings are tragic thought... This is another way of putting the great equation: to will = to create."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 36</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The highest expression of the Will is not domination but creation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>31. The Aim of Critique is the Overman</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The aim of critique is not the ends of man or of reason but in the end the Overman... The point of critique is not justification but a different way of feeling: another sensibility."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 94</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Philosophy's goal is to create the conditions for man to overcome himself by achieving a new, affirmative "way of feeling."</p>

            <p><strong>32. The Overman Laughs</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"'He was transformed, surrounded with light, he was laughing! Never yet on earth had any man laughed as he laughed'... Another becoming, another sensibility: the Overman."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 65</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Laughter is the expression of pure affirmation. The Overman is the one who can laugh in the face of the Eternal Return, affirming everything.</p>

            <p><strong>33. Transmutation: Changing the Element of Values</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"We know what transmutation... means for Nietzsche: not a change of values, but a change in the element from which the value of values derives. Appreciation instead of depreciation, affirmation as will to power..."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 171</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The ultimate creative act. It's not about new morals, but about a new source for all valuation, shifting from negation to affirmation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>34. The New Image of Thought</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"A new image of thought means primarily that truth is not the element of thought. The element of thought is sense and value."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 104</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The final goal is a new image of thought where philosophy is no longer a search for truth but an evaluation of forces and a creation of values.</p>

            <p><strong>35. The Ethical Goal: Inventing New Possibilities of Life</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Thinking would then mean discovering, inventing new possibilities of Life."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 101</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The ultimate, affirmative motive. The entire destructive and critical apparatus of Deleuze's philosophy is in the service of this single goal: to free thought to create new, more powerful, and more joyful ways of living.</p>
            
            <p><strong>36. The Secret of Repetition</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The secret repetition surrounds itself with a mechanical and bare repetition as though this were the final barrier..."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 289</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The overt, mechanical repetitions of our lives (habits, clichés) are merely the outer shell. The real work of thought is to connect with the secret, creative repetition of difference that lies beneath.</p>

            <p><strong>37. Repetition as the Category of the Future</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"A philosophy of repetition must pass through all these 'stages'... making repetition the category of the future."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 94</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Deleuze's three syntheses of time are part of an ethical project to move beyond the repetitions of the past (Memory) and present (Habit) to a creative repetition of the future (Eternal Return).</p>

            <p><strong>38. The Divine Game</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The divine game... First, there is no pre-existent rule, since the game includes its own rules. As a result, every time, the whole of chance is affirmed in a necessarily winning throw."</em><br>— Conclusion, p. 283</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The ultimate vision of the Eternal Return is a game where every throw is a winning throw because it affirms the totality of chance.</p>

            <p><strong>39. Is Man Essentially Reactive?</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"What constitutes man and his world is... the becoming-reactive of all forces..."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 167</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> This is the core problem of humanity. Man is the being in whom active forces have become reactive. The Overman is the figure who reverses this process.</p>

            <p><strong>40. Negation becomes a Power of Affirmation</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Negation transformed into a power of affirmation, the supreme Dionysian metamorphosis."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 71</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> This is the essence of transmutation. The critical "no" becomes a tool in the service of a greater, creative "yes."</p>

            <p><strong>41. Thought and the Fracture</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"...the death of God, the fractured I and the passive self."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 87</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The breakdown of the unified subject ("I") is not a failure but the very condition for the emergence of real, creative thought.</p>

            <p><strong>42. The Secret of Philosophy</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Philosophy's mystification begins, however, from the moment it renounces its role as demystifier and takes the established powers into consideration: when it gives up the harming of stupidity and the denunciation of baseness."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 106</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> A clear statement of Deleuze's view of philosophy's duty. Its role is to be critical, to attack stupidity and baseness, not to justify the established order.</p>

            <p><strong>43. The Link between Repetition and Difference</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Repetition in the eternal return is the same, but the same in so far as it is said uniquely of difference and the different. This is a complete reversal of the world of representation..."</em><br>— Conclusion, p. 301</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The two core concepts come together. The Eternal Return is not the repetition of the "Same," but the repetition of difference itself.</p>

            <p><strong>44. The Power of the False</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"Art is the highest power of falsehood, it magnifies the 'world as error', it sanctifies the lie; the will to deception is turned into a superior ideal."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 102</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> Deleuze embraces the "false" not as error, but as the creative power of art and thought to invent new realities.</p>

            <p><strong>45. Philosophy Against its Time</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"This is why philosophy has an essential relation to time: it is always against its time, critique of the present world. The philosopher creates concepts that are neither eternal nor historical but untimely..."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 107</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The philosopher is not a chronicler of their time, but an "untimely" creator of concepts that disrupt the present in the name of a future to come.</p>
            
            <p><strong>46. The Universal Ungrounding</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The ground has been superseded by a groundlessness, a universal ungrounding which turns upon itself and causes only the yet-to-come to return."</em><br>— Difference and Repetition, p. 91</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> The ultimate goal is to move beyond any fixed foundation (God, the Self, the Cogito) to a creative "groundlessness" from which new thoughts can emerge.</p>
            
            <p><strong>47. Thinking Without an Image</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The thought which is born in thought, the act of thinking which is neither given by innateness nor presupposed by reminiscence but engendered in its genitality, is a thought without image."</em><br>— Conclusion, p. 167</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> This is the goal: to achieve a way of thinking that is not governed by the pre-existing "dogmatic image," a thought that is a pure act of creation.</p>

            <p><strong>48. Philosophy's Task: To Harm Stupidity</strong></p>
            <blockquote><p><em>"The use of philosophy is to sadden. A philosophy that saddens no one, that annoys no one, is not a philosophy. It is useful for harming stupidity, for turning stupidity into something shameful."</em><br>— Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 106</p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>Gloss:</strong> A powerful, concluding statement on motive. Philosophy's critical duty is to be aggressive, to attack the thoughtlessness that underpins our lives, in order to make space for genuine thought.</p>

            <h3>Part III: How to Proceed: My Reading Strategy</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><p><strong>Read This Document:</strong> Familiarize myself with the overall narrative arc presented in the passages. Let the analogy of "intellectual poisoning" be my guide. See if I can map the artist's tactics (Trojan Horse, attacking weak points, corrupting the dataset) onto Deleuze's concepts.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Read <em>Nietzsche and Philosophy</em>:</strong> Start here. It is the more direct, passionate, and polemical of the two books. It will ground me firmly in Deleuze's ethical and creative motivations. As I read, keep the passages from this book in mind as signposts to the core arguments of each chapter.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Read <em>Difference and Repetition</em>:</strong> With the motive from <em>Nietzsche and Philosophy</em> clear, I can now tackle this more systematic and challenging work. Use the selected passages as anchors. When I encounter the difficult sections on the three syntheses of time or the critique of representation, refer back to the relevant quotes and glosses in this guide. The passages will help me see that this complex machinery is all in the service of the ethical project I've already understood.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Revisit the Analogy:</strong> As I read both books, continually ask myself: How is this argument a form of "intellectual poisoning"? Where is the "Trojan Horse"? What is the "degraded output" Deleuze is trying to produce in the reader's mind?</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>This approach will allow me to use the curated passages as a map, transforming what can be a disorienting experience into a guided exploration of one of the most powerful and creative philosophical projects of the 20th century.</p>
            
            <h4>A final little question: is there a version of this motivated by love for the system and everyone living in it? Is there a version of this that is being in the world but not of the world? Is that a version of the analogy?</h3>
