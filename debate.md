## About the Debate

This collection documents the institutional history of the Capital archive's reorganization. Over four phases spanning decades, archivists argued about how to file reality itself.

The debate reveals three distinct **archivist temperaments**:
- **Clerkly Archivists**: Procedural custodians focused on preservation and accuracy
- **Romantic Archivists**: Narrativizing witnesses who want slips to cohere into stories  
- **Philosophical Archivists**: Systematizing legislators confident that categories reveal metaphysical truths

## The Four Phases

### Phase I — Regional Drawers (Years 1–12)
Everything filed by geography. **Clerkly dominance** with occasional philosophical seeds.

### Phase II — Faults in Geography (Years 13–20) 
Evidence begins leaking across regional boundaries. **All three temperaments emerge** as contradictions multiply.

### Phase III — Orders Proposal (Year 22)
Introduction of six metaphysical Orders to replace geographic filing. **Philosophical dominance** with clerkly resistance.

### Phase IV — Implementation & Objections (Year 23+)
Ongoing tensions as the new system reveals how classification shapes reality. **Three-way collision** generates institutional self-consciousness.
