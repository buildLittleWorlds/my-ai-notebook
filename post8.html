            <h2>8 Something online about the soul of art</h2>
            <p>I read <a href="https://medium.com/@scholarsonyalphy2022/ai-and-the-soul-of-art-aff2a9c60970">this thing</a> online about AI and the soul of art.</p>
<p>I went to Claude and asked, "Help me analyze whether this was written entirely by a human, partly by an AI or mostly by an AI" and then pasted in the "soul of art" essay. This is what Claude said:</p>

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
    <p>Looking at this text, I believe it was <strong>mostly written by AI</strong> with possible minor human editing or prompting. Here are the key indicators:</p>
    
    <h3>Strong AI Writing Patterns:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Formulaic Structure</strong>: The piece follows a very predictable template - introduction with thesis, systematic coverage of subtopics, clear transitions, and tidy conclusion. This mechanical organization is characteristic of AI writing.</li>
        <li><strong>Surface-Level Analysis</strong>: Despite being about a complex philosophical topic, the discussion remains surprisingly shallow. It touches on all the expected points (intent, emotion, training data, collaboration) but doesn't dive deeply into any of them.</li>
        <li><strong>Generic Examples</strong>: The Van Gogh example and the sample AI poem ("In the dark of night, we stand...") feel like placeholder examples an AI would generate rather than carefully chosen illustrations a human expert would select.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetitive Phrasing</strong>: The text repeatedly circles back to the same concepts using slightly different wording - a common AI behavior when trying to meet length requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Hedging Language</strong>: Phrases like "might seem," "could be," and "perhaps" appear frequently, which is typical of AI trying to sound measured and avoid definitive claims.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Why Not Entirely Human:</h3>
    <p>A human writing about this topic would likely:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Include specific references to artists, philosophers, or researchers</li>
        <li>Engage with counterarguments more substantively</li>
        <li>Share personal insights or experiences with AI art tools</li>
        <li>Demonstrate deeper knowledge of aesthetic theory</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>This reads like an AI was prompted to write an article about AI's limitations in creating emotional art. The human involvement was likely minimal - perhaps just the initial prompt and maybe light editing. The content hits all the expected talking points but lacks the depth, nuance, and personal voice you'd expect from genuine human expertise on this subject.</p>
