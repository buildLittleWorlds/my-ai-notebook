      <h2>108 Mill on Autonomy (One Key Passage)</h2>

      <p>Both policies assume students’ methods belong to the university to monitor and regulate. John Stuart Mill, in <em>On Liberty</em>, gives a better principle:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><em>“The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest.”</em></p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Why It Matters for Students</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Self-regarding conduct:</strong> Methods (how one drafts, researches, or tools) belong to the student’s “own way.”</li>
        <li><strong>Other-regarding wrongs:</strong> Plagiarism deceives and harms; that’s a different category.</li>
        <li><strong>Freedom to experiment:</strong> Students need room to try tools and processes without compelled disclosure.</li>
      </ul>
