            <h2>73 An Unacknowledged Inheritance</h2>

            <p>A familiar drama plays out with increasing regularity in our cultural life: an artist is accused of a moral transgression, and a public debate erupts. The question is always the same: can we, or should we, separate the art from the artist? The resulting boycotts and refusals are often framed as a uniquely modern phenomenon, a product of social media and "cancel culture." But the intensity of these debates, the profound sense of personal betrayal and moral urgency, suggests a deeper source.</p>

            <p>This series will argue that these contemporary reactions are not new at all. They are the logical outcome of an intellectual point of view we inherited from the Romantic era. The way we conceive of art, authorship, and even our own ethical integrity emerged from a revolutionary period of thought that began over two centuries ago. Our modern debates are, in a sense, a performance of a Romantic drama, powered by an intellectual architecture that remains largely invisible to us.</p>
            
            <p>The purpose of these posts is not to argue for or against the boycott. The goal is genealogical. As I've tried to do before when mapping the <a href="post21.html">"Romantic trace,"</a> I want to uncover this intellectual lineage. The moral grammar we use to condemn or defend, the anxieties about "inauthenticity" and "profaned communion" that I sketched out in my definition of <a href="post9.html">"Romantic Evil,"</a> are not timeless truths. They are historically constructed ideas. By tracing their origins, we can begin to see them not as necessary conditions for art and ethics, but as one important tradition among others, a tradition whose influence we cannot choose to follow or reject unless we understand where it comes from.</p>

            <p>Before we can assess the logic of our own moral instincts, we must first become historians of them. Our investigation begins with the foundational Romantic assumption: the belief that a work of art is a direct and authentic manifestation of its creator's soul.</p>
