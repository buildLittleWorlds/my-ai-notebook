      <h2>57 The Hermeneutic Blind Spot: Insisting on a Ghost</h2>
      <p>A purely systematic analysis of AI—looking only at datasets and algorithms—feels incomplete. The Romantic method, with its insistence on a <strong>double vision</strong>, seems to offer a richer path. It demands we analyze both the <strong>grammatical rail</strong> (the system) and the <strong>psychological rail</strong> (the singular practice).</p>
      <p>But we must remember <em>why</em> the Romantics insisted on this second rail. It wasn't naive optimism; it was a rigorous response to a core belief: that <strong>misunderstanding is the norm</strong>. For Schleiermacher, the gap between two human minds was so vast that a disciplined focus on the author's singular psychology was the only tool sharp enough to bridge it. The "psychological rail" was a necessary invention to solve a human problem.</p>
      
      <h3>The Lure of the Second Rail</h3>
      <p>When we analyze an AI text, the grammatical rail is real. There <em>is</em> a system. But the psychological rail—the search for a singular "voice"—has no corresponding reality. And more importantly, the problem it was designed to solve—the gap between two minds—doesn't exist. There is only one mind in the room: the interpreter's.</p>
      <p>And yet, the Romantic method <em>demands</em> we look for a second. We are compelled to posit a singular "author" to make the hermeneutic circle turn. We invent a ghost because our interpretive machine requires one to function.</p>
      
      <h3>The Critical Pivot: Is the Method Forcing the Conclusion?</h3>
      <p>This is where the Romantic method reveals its foundational bias. It is a system designed to solve the problem of human-to-human communication. It has no category for a text produced by a shared language with no consciousness behind it.</p>
      <p>By insisting on the "psychological rail," are we really understanding the text on its own terms? Or are we applying a powerful tool to a context where its core premise is false? This might be the ultimate "hermeneutic blind spot." The very method designed to overcome misunderstanding may be forcing us to misunderstand the most fundamental quality of AI: its radical, inhuman emptiness.</p>
