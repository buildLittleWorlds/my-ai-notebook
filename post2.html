            <h2>2 Another thing I'm doing</h2>
            <p>Over the summer of 2025, I finished up a book (in collaboration with James Hutson) about AI from a more philosophical angle. I got it done and I sat back and thought about it. The book laid out a coherent thesis, and I worked on developing that thesis in a consistent way. But I sent it off to the publisher, and I started noticing fuzzy or just plain mixed-up things. A bunch of things might just be wrong. So I built a site with imaginary reviews and critiques of the book to help me think about it.</p>
            <p>Here's the link to that other site: <a href="https://buildlittleworlds.github.io/mind-machine-will/"><em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em></a></p>
