            <p class="deck"><em>Not a list but a score. The analysis proceeds in five movements with interludes and counterfigures. Each movement reorganizes image and lyric into a different register of address, testing how the pronoun <em>you</em> is produced and rotated by spectacle, intimacy, economy, memory, and tradition.</em></p>

        <h2>Overture: statement of problem and constraints</h2>
        <p>
          The pronoun <em>you</em> in “Hero” appears at first as a singular addressee; the video refuses that simplicity. Rodeo, crowd, flag, fence, paycheck, partner, child—each scene installs a second-person function with a different demand. The objective is to recover a model of <em>you</em> adequate to these rotations, using only minimal lyric fragments and repeatable correspondences to the video’s objects and spaces. Lyric fragments are cited in short units from the supplied transcript:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. Image-objects are drawn from the catalog of fifty items with time-stamps and notes:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Site presentation and markup follow the house style:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
        </p>

        <h2>Method: three instruments</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Syntagm (sequence):</strong> chains of video images (chute → number → arena → truck → yard → bleachers) are read for how they stage address-effects.</li>
          <li><strong>Paradigm (substitution):</strong> contested prepositions and near-synonyms (“fight <em>with</em> / <em>like</em> everyone else”) are treated as meaningful alternatives rather than noise:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.</li>
          <li><strong>Periodic synthesis:</strong> each movement closes with a ledger of what <em>you</em> has come to mean, ready to be contradicted by the next movement.</li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h2>Movement I — First Encounters: how the apparatus speaks</h2>

        <h3>I.1 The gate</h3>
        <p>
          The rodeo <em>chute</em> coils force and protocol in a single rectangle, a literal holding structure:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. The lyric offers the smallest imperative—“<em>let me go</em>”:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}—without naming an addressee. In this frame, <em>you</em> functions as the apparatus that restrains. No face is required; address is a pressure.
        </p>

        <h3>I.2 The code</h3>
        <p>
          The <em>number on the back</em> converts a person into an entry; identification becomes enumeration:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. The token “<em>your</em> hero” binds the index to a gaze:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. <em>You</em> takes the shape of those who consume the numbered body as symbol and purchase risk as spectacle.
        </p>

        <h3>I.3 Flag, parade, mask</h3>
        <p>
          The <em>American flag</em> sutures rodeo ritual to a national dramaturgy:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}. The word “<em>parade</em>” names choreography rather than affection:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. “<em>Masquerade</em>” intensifies the claim: identity here is a surface required by the ritual crowd:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. The earliest grammar thus yields: <em>you</em> = spectacle-form that hails the rider into a role.
        </p>

        <h3>I.4 Interim ledger (I)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><em>You</em> as apparatus of constraint (chute):contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.</li>
          <li><em>You</em> as consuming gaze (number → “your hero”):contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}.</li>
          <li><em>You</em> as civic choreography (flag → parade → masquerade):contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Movement II — The social mask and its residues</h2>

        <h3>II.1 Trophies in small rooms</h3>
        <p>
          A <em>trophy</em> sits in a cramped trailer—glory detached from stability:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}. The lyric’s “<em>big man</em>” registers status as a domestic inconvenience rather than a blessing:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}. Trophies are the material residue of the parade; they constitute a silent second person: <em>be this</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>II.2 Fence, distance, class of watched men</h3>
        <p>
          The arena <em>fence</em> divides performers and onlookers:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}. The fragment “<em>walk with everyone else</em>” refuses altitude in favor of accompaniment:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}. Spectacle needs a fence; the desired social relation breaks it. <em>You</em> = the segregating line that turns labor into an image.
        </p>

        <h3>II.3 Light and dust</h3>
        <p>
          Stadium <em>lights</em> sanctify dust into a luminous haze:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}. The reprise “<em>masquerade</em>” becomes optical: harm beautified for purchase:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}. The pronoun extends beyond crowd to the visual regime that makes risk into icon.
        </p>

        <h3>II.4 Interlude: the empty bleachers</h3>
        <p>
          The band performs on <em>bleachers</em> without spectators:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}. The architecture of seeing is present; the eyes are not. The performance is an <em>anti-parade</em>: the addressee implied by the setting fails to arrive. The lyric “<em>we can whisper things</em>” fits the scene’s acoustics:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}. Whisper requires nearness; the stadium wants roar.
        </p>

        <h3>II.5 Interim ledger (II)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><em>You</em> as status-demand in domestic space (trophy → “big man”):contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}.</li>
          <li><em>You</em> as fence (division required for spectacle):contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}:contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}.</li>
          <li><em>You</em> as optical beautification (light/dust → masquerade):contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}.</li>
          <li><em>You</em> as absent mass (bleachers empty; the song selects a near listener):contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}:contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Movement III — Intimacy, secrecy, and the near listener</h2>

        <h3>III.1 Shoulder-height</h3>
        <p>
          The image of the daughter on the rider’s <em>shoulders</em> literalizes support:contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}. “<em>Baby needs some protection</em>” installs care as a counter-demand to spectacle:contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}. The pronoun narrows: not nation, not crowd, but a small person whose claim on time complicates the heroic script.
        </p>

        <h3>III.2 Doorway</h3>
        <p>
          A <em>screen door</em> frames the mother; the daughter moves freely through it:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}. “<em>your parade</em>” acquires a domestic theater: the rites of visitation, gifts, ice cream, brief triumphs for the child:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}. Endurance replaces applause. Here, <em>you</em> may be a co-parent’s calculus of costs rather than a cheering public.
        </p>

        <h3>III.3 Whisper and secrets</h3>
        <p>
          “<em>We can whisper things</em>” and “<em>secrets</em> from our American dreams” relocate address into confidence:contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}. Bar bokeh and shallow focus create a vestibule for confession:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}. The confidant is concealed within the ideological frame named “American dreams”; intimacy and myth speak in the same low voice.
        </p>

        <h3>III.4 The other bed</h3>
        <p>
          A woman sleeps in the trailer who is not the child’s mother:contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}. The connective “<em>part of</em>” (as in “part of your parade”) acquires weight:contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}. Life divides into incompatible sets; address fractionalizes across them. The second person becomes a relational matrix rather than a single beloved.
        </p>

        <h3>III.5 Interim ledger (III)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><em>You</em> as the protected (child):contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42}:contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}.</li>
          <li><em>You</em> as the domestic auditor of costs (co-parent):contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44}:contentReference[oaicite:45]{index=45}.</li>
          <li><em>You</em> as confidant within a shared myth (“American dreams”):contentReference[oaicite:46]{index=46}:contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47}.</li>
          <li><em>You</em> as distributed relation (competing attachments):contentReference[oaicite:48]{index=48}:contentReference[oaicite:49]{index=49}.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Movement IV — Wage, provision, and the ordinary</h2>

        <h3>IV.1 Apron, hose, crates</h3>
        <p>
          Day work under the <em>El Torito</em> sign folds the bull back into wage:contentReference[oaicite:50]{index=50}. “<em>Holding down a job to keep my girl around</em>” places intimacy on an economic ledger:contentReference[oaicite:51]{index=51}. The second person here can be read as the condition under which love is retained: <em>you</em> = a staying made possible by cash.
        </p>

        <h3>IV.2 Strings and nights out</h3>
        <p>
          “<em>Maybe buy me some new strings / and her a night out</em>” triangulates instrument, partner, and small surplus:contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52}. The <em>money in hand</em> fixes the mediation:contentReference[oaicite:53]{index=53}. Address is no longer face-to-face; it is folded into envelopes and receipts. Provision speaks in second person.
        </p>

        <h3>IV.3 Cart and boyhood</h3>
        <p>
          A <em>shopping cart</em> becomes a vehicle; play interrupts adulthood:contentReference[oaicite:54]{index=54}. “<em>I’m a kid like everyone else</em>” contradicts the demand to be “big”:contentReference[oaicite:55]{index=55}. The desired community—“everyone else”—is ordinary, unserious, unheroic. The pronoun at stake is the adulting gaze that refuses play.
        </p>

        <h3>IV.4 Trailer and bunk</h3>
        <p>
          A <em>bunk bed</em> in a messy trailer restages boyhood inside a man’s life:contentReference[oaicite:56]{index=56}. The same fragment—“<em>kid</em>”—shifts from excuse to diagnosis:contentReference[oaicite:57]{index=57}. The voice commanding maturity (provide, perform) is internal as much as social; <em>you</em> is sometimes the voice in the mirror.
        </p>

        <h3>IV.5 Interim ledger (IV)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><em>You</em> as condition of staying (wage → intimacy):contentReference[oaicite:58]{index=58}:contentReference[oaicite:59]{index=59}.</li>
          <li><em>You</em> as mediated address (cash, strings, nights out):contentReference[oaicite:60]{index=60}:contentReference[oaicite:61]{index=61}.</li>
          <li><em>You</em> as adulting command opposed by play (cart, bunk):contentReference[oaicite:62]{index=62}:contentReference[oaicite:63]{index=63}.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Movement V — Tradition, variants, and the refusal of singularity</h2>

        <h3>V.1 With / like</h3>
        <p>
          The contested line circulates as “<em>fight with everyone else</em>” in the provided transcript:contentReference[oaicite:64]{index=64}; popular hearings often report “<em>fight like</em> everyone else.” The preposition changes the ethics. <em>With</em> implies solidarity against spectacle; <em>like</em> implies anonymity without exceptionalism. In either case the predicate “hero” is refused.
        </p>

        <h3>V.2 Archival riders</h3>
        <p>
          Grainy <em>archival footage</em> names a tradition older than the subject:contentReference[oaicite:65]{index=65}. “<em>Big man</em>” becomes a mold rather than a mood:contentReference[oaicite:66]{index=66}. The second person can be the dead as much as the living: the role itself speaks as <em>you</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>V.3 Road and mirror</h3>
        <p>
          Highway shots with the <em>rearview mirror</em> insist on pasts that ride along:contentReference[oaicite:67]{index=67}. The refrain “<em>so let me go</em>” devolves into a negotiation with what follows inside the cab:contentReference[oaicite:68]{index=68}. <em>You</em> becomes an interiorized address occupying the mirror rather than the stands.
        </p>

        <h3>V.4 Counterfigure: the bar</h3>
        <p>
          In the bar’s shallow focus, camaraderie can re-enchant danger. “<em>Hero</em>” becomes a story told larger than life:contentReference[oaicite:69]{index=69}:contentReference[oaicite:70]{index=70}. The term is embraced locally, refused globally; the pronoun is context-dependent.
        </p>

        <h3>V.5 Coda: the pickup</h3>
        <p>
          The <em>pickup truck</em> connects incompatible worlds without resolving them:contentReference[oaicite:71]{index=71}. To “<em>let me go</em>” is to request disaffiliation from the second person that organizes the self into image, provider, protector, tradition-bearer, or legend:contentReference[oaicite:72]{index=72}. The vehicle drives the refusal from scene to scene; refusal remains the only stable element.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>General synthesis — the rotating second person</h2>
        <p>
          The readings above converge on a layered account:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong><em>You</em> as Spectacle-Apparatus</strong> (flag, crowd, fence, light; “parade,” “masquerade”)—the civic machinery that converts risk into image:contentReference[oaicite:73]{index=73}:contentReference[oaicite:74]{index=74}.</li>
          <li><strong><em>You</em> as Intimate-Obligation</strong> (child, co-parent, gift; “protection,” “job,” “strings”)—the domestic ledger that translates care into time and money:contentReference[oaicite:75]{index=75}:contentReference[oaicite:76]{index=76}.</li>
          <li><strong><em>You</em> as Internalized Command</strong> (photo wall, mirror, bunk; “big man,” “kid”)—the voice inside that repeats the role’s demand:contentReference[oaicite:77]{index=77}:contentReference[oaicite:78]{index=78}.</li>
          <li><strong><em>You</em> as Near Listener</strong> (empty bleachers; “whisper,” “secrets”)—the small auditor deliberately chosen over a mass:contentReference[oaicite:79]{index=79}:contentReference[oaicite:80]{index=80}.</li>
          <li><strong><em>You</em> as Tradition</strong> (archival riders; “big man”)—the dead’s script still issuing orders:contentReference[oaicite:81]{index=81}:contentReference[oaicite:82]{index=82}.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The pronoun is not a person but a seat of demand that slides across these functions as the scene changes. Refusal targets the seat, not the specific occupant.
        </p>

        <h2>Appendix A — Variant map (image → token)</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Selected correspondences used in this reading:</em> chute → “let me go”; back number → “your hero”; flag → “parade”; crowd → “masquerade”; trophy → “big man”; fence → “walk with everyone else”; daughter on shoulders → “protection”; screen door → “your parade”; cash-in-hand → “strings”; cigarette → “we can whisper things”; bar lights → “secrets” / “American dreams”; rearview/open road → “so let me go”; photo wall → “hero”; sleeping woman → “part of”; rope-grip hands → “fight with/like”; empty bleachers → “whisper”; lights+dust → “masquerade”; pickup → “let me go”; bat/helmet → “walk with”; dogs → “everyone deserves”; trailer/bunk → “kid”; acoustic plainness → “whisper things.” Objects and scenes per the catalog:contentReference[oaicite:83]{index=83}; lyric tokens per the transcript:contentReference[oaicite:84]{index=84}.
        </p>

        <h2>Appendix B — Minimal axioms for further work</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>The pronoun <em>you</em> in “Hero” is a <em>position</em> rather than a <em>character</em>.</li>
          <li>Positions are installed by spaces, tools, protocols, and small economies as much as by faces.</li>
          <li>Refusal in the lyric is generalized: the refrain negates the position regardless of occupant.</li>
          <li>Where the scene narrows to intimacy, <em>you</em> may temporarily denote a face; the broader pattern quickly restores rotation.</li>
          <li>Variant hearings (“with/like”) are not errors but alternate moral programs for de-heroization:contentReference[oaicite:85]{index=85}.</li>
        </ol>
