            <h2>48 But there's another reading</h2>
            <p>notes for another reading</p>
            <p>This quote from post 47 poses a skeptical reading: "Is his dangerous, all-consuming passion for the rodeo a noble sacrifice he makes for her, or is it the very thing that prevents him from being a present father?"</p>
            <p>I don't think it's either. It seems like the song itself, the imagery and words of the song, took off in ways that don't allow any intentional message of the song to win out. This is the structuralist reading, what comes after the unifying impulse of the modernist shoring up the fragments.</p>
            <p>Here's an example. As we get later in the song, after we've seen that the daughter is picked up from where she lives with her mom, not her dad, and the weary face of the girl's mother shows she can't buy into the hero worship the daugther still feels for the father, we're trying to choose maybe between the narrative the mother might tell and the one the daughter might still tell of her dad's heroism. But the song takes off in its direction, following the patterns of pop songs and lyrical development.</p>
            <p>Two things. The song alternates between old footage of a kid in a rodeo and current-looking video of the main character riding in the rodeo. This is language that takes on its own life, nostalgia and grit.</p>
            <p>Second, at about the 1:48 mark, the song switches to the singer with the rest of the band getting ready to join him singing for the first time and the bridge of the song hits and the mood lifts and feels more grand. So the form of the song, the need of a bridge to transcend the repetition of the verses, actually supports a more heroic impulse to rise above the mundane even while the details of realism in the imagery of the song and a lot of the lyrics point more toward the anti-heroic.</p>
