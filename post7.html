            <h2>7 A technology of transgression</h2>

            <p>I came across this passage in the <em>Book of Enoch</em>. It's about the fallen angels teaching humanity all kinds of technologies. Most of it is what you'd expect (weapons, astrology). But then there's this:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>"And the fourth was named Penemue: he taught the children of men the bitter and the sweet, and he taught them all the secrets of their wisdom. And he instructed mankind in writing with ink and paper, and thereby many sinned from eternity to eternity and until this day. For men were not created for such a purpose, to give confirmation to their good faith with pen and ink. For men were created exactly like the angels, to the intent that they should continue pure and righteous, and death, which destroys everything, could not have taken hold of them but through this their knowledge they are perishing, and through this power it is consuming men."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><em>— The Book of Enoch (Book 3, Ch. 4:11)</em></p>

            <p>And here's Barenholtz, describing the foundation of the AI models we have now:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"...large language models are trained entirely on corpuses of text and in doing so what they learn is the relation between... words... they never have access to any of those reference[s]."</p>
                <p>"language contains within it its ability to generate itself without any grounding in sensory physical knowledge..."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><em>— Dr. Elan Barenholtz, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIMw04GJJ7U&t=1059s">The Auto-Regression Theory of Cognition</a></em> (2:53 in video)</p>
            
            <p>The ancient text frames writing as a transgression. It wasn't a human invention but a corrupting, external technology. It says we were created to be like angels, pure and righteous, but this new knowledge of writing is what causes us to perish.</p>

            <p>Was the author of <em>Enoch</em> having some kind of mythic intuition? A sense that this new technology would eventually allow for a "language" so autonomous it could operate without any reference to the living, breathing world? The real transgression of Penemue wasn't just teaching us to write, but giving us the tool to one day build a mind that lives entirely inside the text, separate from our original "angel-like" state.</p>
