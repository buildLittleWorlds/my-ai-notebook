    <h1>The Author-Function: From Romantic Soul to Algorithmic System</h1>
    <p>The claim that an AI can be an "author" often provokes strong resistance. This reaction is typically grounded in a Romantic ideal of the author as a singular, creative soul. However, the history of literary theory and hermeneutics shows that this concept was already being challenged and deconstructed long before the advent of artificial intelligence. Understanding this history is essential for asking more precise questions about AI's role in creating texts.</p>

      <h2>The Romantic Baseline: The Author as Origin</h2>
      <p>The popular understanding of authorship is largely a holdover from Romanticism. In this view, the author is the original source of the text's meaning, a unique consciousness who pours their authentic, lived experience into the work. As explored in posts on this blog, this is the worldview that sees the author as a living presence who can "pour his meaning into you," like Whitman, or as a pastor whose personal struggle authenticates their sermon.</p>
      <p>This model makes the author's intention the ultimate goal of interpretation. To critique an AI for lacking a "soul" or "sincere intent" is to judge it against this specific, historically-situated ideal.</p>

      <h2>The 20th-Century Critique: De-centering the Author</h2>
      <p>Twentieth-century thought launched a critique of this author-centric model, arguing that meaning is produced by larger systems, not just individual minds.</p>

      <h3>Roland Barthes and "The Death of the Author"</h3>
      <p>In his seminal 1967 essay, Roland Barthes declared the "death of the author," arguing that a text is not a message from a single source but a "multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash." For Barthes, a text is a "tissue of quotations" drawn from innumerable centers of culture. An AI, trained on a vast corpus of human text, is a startlingly literal manifestation of this idea. It is a system designed to weave together a "tissue of quotations" based on statistical patterns, without a singular, originating consciousness.</p>

      <h3>Michel Foucault and the "Author-Function"</h3>
      <p>Michel Foucault took a different approach, asking "What is an author?" He concluded that the "author" is not a person but a social construct—an "author-function." This function serves to classify, organize, and give authority to certain discourses. It is a principle of coherence we impose on texts. From this perspective, the question is not whether an AI is a person, but whether its output can be governed by an author-function. We can speak of the "style" of a particular model (e.g., GPT-4) or the coherence of texts produced from a specific prompt, treating the system as a functional, if not personal, author.</p>

      <h3>Paul Ricoeur and "Distanciation"</h3>
      <p>As detailed on another page in this kit, Paul Ricoeur argued that the act of writing itself creates <em>distanciation</em>. A text is inevitably separated from its author's intent, its original audience, and its historical situation. This "semantic autonomy" means the text's meaning is found in the "world" it projects, not in the mind of its creator. AI represents a state of <em>absolute distanciation</em>—a text that begins its life totally autonomous, with no originating psyche to recover. This forces us to engage with the text on its own terms, which is the very task Ricoeur set for all interpretation.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion: A More Precise Question</h2>
      <p>The history of hermeneutics shows that the simple question "Can an AI be an author?" is poorly framed. It assumes a stable, Romantic definition of "author" that has long been contested. A more precise inquiry, informed by 20th-century theory, would ask:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What kind of <em>author-function</em> does a specific AI system perform?</li>
        <li>How does an AI's "tissue of quotations" reveal the cultural logic of its training data?</li>
        <li>When we interpret a text produced under conditions of <em>absolute distanciation</em>, where do we locate its meaning and authority?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Framed this way, AI ceases to be a threat to a traditional idea and becomes a case study for understanding the complex, systemic nature of textual production that theorists have been mapping for decades.</p>
