    <h1>Contexts: Germany (The Philosophical Engine)</h1>
    <p>German Romanticism, particularly the circle in Jena, was the intellectual crucible of the movement. More than a literary style, it was a philosophical revolution that sought to fuse poetry with theory, art with science, and life with thought. It provided the rigorous concepts that would be adapted and transformed across Europe.</p>

    <h3>Signature Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A New Critical Program:</strong> A core project of the German Romantics, particularly the Schlegel brothers, was to transform the very meaning of the word <em>romantisch</em>. As René Wellek has shown, they took a term that historically referred to medieval romances (like those of Ariosto and Cervantes) and repurposed it into a conscious, polemical, and philosophical program. "Romantic" became the banner for a new kind of art defined in opposition to the rules and constraints of Neoclassicism.<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup></li>
      <li><strong>The Fusion of Everything:</strong> The central project, articulated by Friedrich Schlegel, was "progressive universal poetry." A dynamic, infinitely expandable form of art that could absorb philosophy, criticism, and mythology. A key influence on Schlegel was Johann Gottfried Herder, who saw the <em>Roman</em> (a term encompassing not just the modern novel but also medieval romances and even Shakespeare's plays) as the representative genre of the post-classical era. Herder characterized the <em>Roman</em> by its "Mischung" (mixture) of genres. Schlegel adopted and radicalized this idea, seeing the <em>Roman</em> as the ultimate "Mischgedicht" (mixed genre) destined to synthesize all other forms of poetry, philosophy, and criticism into a new, living whole.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup></li>
      <li><strong><a href="romantic-kit-organic-form.html">Organic Unity</a> as Metaphysics:</strong> Friedrich Schelling’s <em>Naturphilosophie</em> gave philosophical weight to the organic metaphor. It argued that nature and mind were two sides of the same living, creative reality, providing a basis for theories of organic form in art.</li>
      <li><strong>Romantic Irony:</strong> A sophisticated concept where a work of art demonstrates self-awareness. The author can signal their detachment from their own creation, acknowledging its limits and opening it to endless interpretation. It is a mark of artistic freedom and intellectual agility.</li>
      <li><strong>The Primacy of the Aesthetic:</strong> For the German Romantics, art was not mere decoration; it was the highest form of knowledge. They believed that new forms like "Romantic poetry" were the only language capable of expressing the ineffable <em>Gefühl</em> (feeling), which they believed granted access to the infinite reality that rational discourse could not capture.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This philosophical project was a grand act of <a href="romantic-kit-technology-machine.html">"natural supernaturalism."</a> Thinkers like Schiller and Hegel took the Biblical plot of Creation, Fall, and Redemption and translated it into a secular, philosophical history of consciousness. The fall from Eden became the mind's necessary fall into self-awareness and division. The final Apocalypse was reimagined as the mind's achievement of a higher, self-conscious unity through reason and art. This provided the essential blueprint for the <a href="https://victorianweb.org/religion/apocalypse/dungey.html">"circuitous journey"</a> that would define the Romantic era.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Forms & Figures</h3>
    <p>The movement's philosophical aims were reflected in its experimental forms.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Fragment:</strong> Used by the Schlegel brothers and Novalis, the aphoristic fragment was a deliberate choice. It presented insights as incomplete and provocative, inviting the reader into a collaborative process of thought rather than presenting a closed system. The fragment stimulates the reader's own <em>Gefühl</em> rather than simply describing the author's, making the act of reading a participatory and creative process.</li>
      <li><strong>Key Figures:</strong> Friedrich and August Wilhelm Schlegel (the theorists), Novalis (the visionary poet), Friedrich Schelling (the philosopher), and Friedrich Schleiermacher (the theologian and hermeneuticist).</li>
    </ul>
