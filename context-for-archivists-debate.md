Here’s a field guide you can hand to the graduate student—dense on context, rich with examples, and designed to keep them “in character” as a Capital archivist writing into the debate. It distills what the archive is, what Densworld seems to be doing, why the archivists are arguing, and how to produce daily documents that both advance the world and feel internally authentic.

# The Archive, the Capital, and the Debate: A Working Guide for the Next Archivist

## 0) What this job is (and isn’t)

Your assignment is to speak from inside the Capital archive. You are an archivist—sometimes junior, sometimes senior; sometimes dissenting, sometimes orthodox—who files slips, argues policy, and slowly realizes that classification is not just housekeeping but a theory of the world.

But the Archive does not speak in one voice. Over time, three distinct **archivist temperaments** have emerged, each with its own approach to the central question:

> Does the archive mirror the world's structure, or does the archive's language help shape it?&#x20;

**The Three Temperaments:**

- **Clerkly Archivists**: Procedural, anxious, focused on custody and stamps. They distrust both story and metaphysics, insisting "Archivists are custodians, not philosophers." Their voice is dry, technical, precise.
- **Romantic Archivists**: Narrativizing, dramatic, skeptical of "mere protocol." They want slips to become coherent stories, to sing. They write like witnesses rather than clerks.
- **Philosophical Archivists**: Abstract, systematizing, confident that categories reveal metaphysical truths. They legislate, invent Orders, and reshape filing systems with systematic ambition.

The Archivists' Debate is not simply geography vs. Orders, but **clerkly vs. romantic vs. philosophical**—a three-way tension that shapes every document, every policy shift, every voice you'll encounter.

Everything below gives you a thick sense of the world ("Densworld"), the archive that tries to keep it, and how these three temperaments clash over the proper method of that keeping.

---

## 1) The world as the archive encounters it (Densworld in brief)

Think of Densworld not as a map, but as a set of **recurring pressures** the slips keep bringing back to your desk. The archive’s current best attempt to model those pressures is the system of **Orders**—six metaphysical classes used to file evidence by what reality it performs rather than where it was found:

* **Boundary** — unstable edges; town/wilderness; lines that move.&#x20;
* **Doubling** — replication; journeys spawning journeys; originals-without-origin.&#x20;
* **Craving** — desire as generative force; appetites that make artifacts.&#x20;
* **Silence & Withdrawal** — renunciation; non-speech methods; ritual cadence.&#x20;
* **Violence & Secret Life** — parallel ledgers of harm; murder songs; numerologies.&#x20;
* **Mediation & Aperture** — windows, devices, carts; constraints on access and authorship.&#x20;

These Orders **supersede Region** as the primary way to shelve evidence; Region is now secondary provenance. That policy shift is the heart of the debate you’ll be writing into.&#x20;

### Regional textures (provenance drawer, not destiny)

* **Dens / Densmok** — a town that is also a wilderness; testimonies and meter logs track each other as the edge moves. &#x20;
* **Yeller Quarry** — journeys that throw more journeys; a culture of copies and proliferations (roads, silhouettes). &#x20;
* **North / Northo** — murder songs and secret ledgers; also the mapmaker’s cart that opens inward.&#x20;
* **Capital / Capeast** — the bureaucratic heart; access engineered by windows, stairs, and rules; festivals as after-ledgers.&#x20;
* **Tower / Sticks** — catechisms that make speech lay tracks for the hand; withdrawals that put hands before words. &#x20;
* **Dead River** — a counting mania that seeks “five,” shadowed by the cart and by alley-market silhouettes.&#x20;

---

## 2) The Capital and its method (why the window matters)

The Capital does not just file paper; it **architects access**. The canonical emblem is the **round window**: an aperture “not to exceed one-third cranial width,” through which *slips* may pass, but not bodies. The inspection log reads like scripture for mediation: lacquers, tolerances, static incidents, pass/fail.&#x20;

The commentary makes the doctrine plain: “This window is not a door. The rule is design: knowledge may pass; bodies may not.” Filing under **Mediation & Aperture** is not aesthetic; it’s the city’s theory of truth.&#x20;

Even staircases are policy—“designed to slow crowds while favoring licensed knees.” In Capital, the building *is* the filter.&#x20;

**Takeaway for your voice:** When you write as a Capital archivist, be exact, procedural, and attentive to devices: windows, carts, rigs, ledgers. Describe how form constrains access—that’s the Capital’s way of thinking.

## 3) The debate you're joining (its phases and temperamental evolution)

The archivists have formalized their quarrel as a four-phase institutional history, but each phase shows a different balance of temperaments:

* **Phase I — Regional Drawers (Years 1-12):** Everything filed by geography, "Provenance First." **Clerkly dominance**, with occasional philosophical seeds. Romance barely appears. Documents: precise minutes, custody protocols, early systematizing memos.

* **Phase II — Faults in Geography (Years 13-20):** Evidence begins to leak across drawers (moving edges, originals that won't resolve, authorless devices). **All three temperaments emerge clearly** for the first time. Clerkly field reports document contradictions; romantic colloquy notes narrativize refusals; philosophical case notes propose new Orders.

* **Phase III — Orders Proposal (Year 22):** Varro's memorandum introduces the six Orders and argues Orders-first filing. Kettel counters that metaphysical labels risk *making* cases. **Philosophical dominance** with clerkly resistance. Romance largely absent—this is abstract systematizers vs. anxious custodians.

* **Phase IV — Implementation & Objections (Year 23+):** A directive adopts Orders-first with cross-indexing; hearings probe whether catalog language feeds back into practice. **All three temperaments collide**, generating self-consciousness about the Archive's world-shaping role.

The debate is not just methodological but psychological: each temperament brings different fears, different hopes, different voices to the same evidence.

A succinct planning brief codifies how this hub "does history," what each phase should link to, and the editorial standards for debate docs (Orders-first → Form → Region; clips as evidence; contradictions preserved). Use it as your procedural compass.  &#x20;

---

## 4) The Orders as working lenses (with canonical anchors)

Each Order below includes 1) what it catches, 2) emblematic exhibits, and 3) a question you can push in daily writing.

### A. Boundary

* **What it catches:** edges that won’t hold; measurements and stories that move each other.
* **Exhibits:** Dens testimonies (“two kinds of story”) and the west-ditch meter series (Years 17–19) that rises and falls with those testimonies. &#x20;
* **Your question:** When measurement follows speech, is the border a place—or a grammar?

### B. Doubling

* **What it catches:** proliferations; copies without origin; roads that bud inside other roads.
* **Exhibits:** Quarry colloquy minutes on roads (“each path throws another”), and Castelia’s “fivefold” hunt silhouettes whose details don’t align across impressions. &#x20;
* **Your question:** If originals won’t resolve, what does “authenticity” even measure?

### C. Craving

* **What it catches:** desire that makes artifacts—rigs, songs, crowds.
* **Exhibits:** Densmok’s coder-singers and mind-node rigs (catalogs of humming, pairing, afterimages); Capeast festival aftermath where appetite and rumor reorganize a square.&#x20;
* **Your question:** When appetite leaves artifacts, should we file the artifact—or the appetite?

### D. Silence & Withdrawal

* **What it catches:** practices that put hands before words; repetition that builds fit.
* **Exhibits:** Tower catechism: “edges to edges” drills that turn into habit speech; Sticks withdrawal logs where quiet-hours re-mark the local grammar of action. &#x20;
* **Your question:** If silence is a method, can the archive quote it without breaking it?

### E. Violence & Secret Life

* **What it catches:** parallel ledgers of harm; the public melody with a private confession under it.
* **Exhibits:** North murder songs index (first lines, doubled voices, marginal notes about a “missionary” killer).&#x20;
* **Your question:** What counts as confession when the melody is communal?

### F. Mediation & Aperture

* **What it catches:** how devices, windows, carts, and paperwork constrain access and authorship.
* **Exhibits:** Capital window inspections (“no door; slips only”); the mapmaker’s pickbox cart that “opens inward,” pulling its own world; counting-five cases where the market’s silhouette and the road’s rumor braid into one dossier. &#x20;
* **Your question:** When form is already theory, can we pretend the catalog is neutral?

---

## 5) The slip as your unit of truth (and how temperaments cite differently)

Every piece of evidence you use should be treated as a **clip**—verbatim or near-verbatim excerpt—wrapped in protocol, then indexed. The standing **"How to Cite a Clip"** procedure (Protocol 7.3) standardizes this for all archivists:

* Identify **Slip Code**; note **Provenance** (Region + Form); quote with `||` or blockquote; assign **Order(s)**; add a short **Commentary** line explaining how the clip pressures the filing choice. &#x20;

**But commentary differs by temperament:**

- **Clerkly** → "Filed under Dens; meter vs. stool testimony recorded."
- **Romantic** → "She swore the ditch had grown; her words swell the town itself."  
- **Philosophical** → "Evidence of Boundary: geography resizes itself through speech."

**Practice rule:** **Contradictions are evidence**. Don't reconcile mismatched witness cards; don't collapse parallel testimonies. File both; say why both matter. But temperaments handle contradictions differently: clerks preserve them mechanically, romantics dramatize them as narrative tension, philosophers systematize them as dialectical pressure.&#x20;

---

## 6) The kinds of documents you should produce (by temperament and phase)

Write one document per day, **in character**. But now you must choose not only voice and rank (junior clerk, field officer, registrar, dissenter) but **temperament**. Keep them short (400–900 words), but let the temperament shape your administrative tone. 

**CRITICAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
* Filename pattern: `phase{N}-{type}-{descriptive-slug}.md`
* Frontmatter field `clerk_initials:` NOT `clerk:`
* Phase field: "I", "II", "III", "IV" (not full descriptions)
* All regions and orders as arrays: `["Region1"]` not just `"Region1"`
* NO H1 headings in content - Jekyll displays frontmatter title

The debate hub's plan lists the main genres and the Phase they tend to belong to, but each genre leans toward certain temperaments:

**Genre-Temperament Tendencies:**
* **Memos**: Often philosophical (ambitious, systematizing)
* **Minutes**: Clerkly (terse, procedural)  
* **Circulars**: Clerkly (policy handouts)
* **Colloquy Notes**: Romantic (narrative, minor voices)
* **Case Notes**: Hybrid (fact-based, but with narrative gloss)
* **Field Reports**: Usually clerkly, sometimes philosophical
* **Hearings**: Romantic-philosophical (dialogic, dramatic)
* **Rulings**: Clerkly (legalistic)
* **Counter-Memos**: Any temperament in opposition mode

**All debate docs should:**

* Lead with **Phase**, **Doc Type**, **Order Focus**, **Region(s)**, **Date & Clerk**.
* Include **≥1 clip** (use Protocol 7.3, commentary matched to temperament).
* End with **Disposition** (Adopted / Filed / Referred / Superseded).
* Cross-reference **≥2 slips** and **≥1 doc in a different Phase** whenever possible.&#x20;
* **Embody a clear temperamental voice** throughout.

### Temperamental approaches to the same evidence

The same slip can be filed differently depending on temperament:

**Clip:** || "The ditch rose two hands overnight. Dens is shrinking." ||

- **Clerkly approach**: "Measurement recorded. Filed under Dens, meter log. Contradicts stool testimony D-17b. Both preserved."
- **Romantic approach**: "The earth itself speaks here, swelling against the town's borders. What story does the ditch tell?"
- **Philosophical approach**: "Evidence of Boundary Order: geography demonstrates unstable edges through measurable shift."

---

## 7) Canonical motifs you should keep returning to

These are “world-engines”—repeat them, rotate them, cross-index them. Each has at least one anchor slip you can quote.

* **Two kinds of Dens** (town vs wilderness). The edge moves when the story moves. &#x20;
* **The window** (no door). Access engineered; paper passes; bodies do not.&#x20;
* **Roads that bud** in the Quarry. Proliferation over origin.&#x20;
* **Fivefold silhouettes** (Castelia). Copies with mismatched wrists and jawlines.&#x20;
* **The pickbox cart** that opens inward. Authorless burden; house in a wheelbarrow logic.&#x20;
* **Murder songs** and the missionary. Public melody, private ledger.&#x20;
* **Edges to edges** (Tower catechism). Speech lays the track for the hand; habit spills into meaning. &#x20;
* **Withdrawal logs** (Sticks). Quiet hours reset grammar; hands first, words last.&#x20;

---

## 8) Daily practice: temperament rotation and voice discipline

### A. Rotating temperaments (cycle through all three)

Your weekly rhythm should balance all three voices:

* **Clerkly days:** Focus on procedures, custody, contradictions as filing problems. Motto: "Archivists are custodians, not philosophers." Style: terse, precise, distrustful of grand theories.

* **Romantic days:** Focus on stories, witnesses, coherence. Motto: "A slip must be told as story." Style: narrative, testimonial, dramatic. Let minor voices speak.

* **Philosophical days:** Focus on categories, systems, metaphysical patterns. Motto: "The Archive reveals the world's orders." Style: abstract, systematic, ambitious.

### B. Temperamental stances within methodological positions

Each temperament can take any position on the geography/Orders debate:

**Pro-Orders position:**
- Clerkly: "Orders provide clearer filing protocols."
- Romantic: "Orders let slips sing together across regions."  
- Philosophical: "Orders reveal the world's true structure."

**Pro-Geography position:**
- Clerkly: "Provenance is least-falsifiable anchor."
- Romantic: "Place holds stories; Orders scatter them."
- Philosophical: "Geography is the most fundamental category."

### C. Temperament-specific prompts (rotate through all three approaches)

Pick an Order, then approach it through each temperament:

**Boundary prompts:**
- Clerkly: "Ditch meter rose 3cm overnight. Stool testimony claims Dens expanded. Both filed under Dens. Contradiction noted."
- Romantic: "She swore the town had grown in her sleep. When morning came, the ditch agreed."
- Philosophical: "Evidence demonstrates Boundary Order: geography self-modifies through testimonial feedback loops."

**Doubling prompts:**
- Clerkly: "Five silhouettes submitted. Origin unknown. All catalogued. Authentication inconclusive."  
- Romantic: "They brought me five shadows of the same woman. Each claimed to be first. Who was I to choose?"
- Philosophical: "Multiplication without original suggests Doubling Order transcends simple replication paradigms."

**Apply this approach to all six Orders, cycling through temperaments.**

### D. Constraints to obey every time

* Use **at least one clip** with the **Protocol 7.3** formatting.&#x20;
* Assign **1–3 Orders** (primary) and **Region(s)** (secondary).&#x20;
* **Contradictions ≠ errors**; log and cross-index them.&#x20;
* End with a **Disposition** (Adopted / Filed / Referred / Superseded).&#x20;
* **Maintain temperamental consistency** throughout the document.
* Remember: clerks preserve, romantics narrate, philosophers systematize.

## 9) Micro-models (two short “in character” pieces to imitate)

### (a) Colloquy Note — *On the Overflowing Ledger* (Phase II; Doubling → Quarry)

**Abstract.** The minutes record that our maps double faster than we can declare an origin. We propose shelving under **Doubling** with Region as provenance.

**Clip (D2):**
`|| But midway a second road buds off inside the first… The maps cannot agree which is the copy and which is the line. Each path throws another. ||`&#x20;

**Commentary.** “Origin/fork” is a sentimental verb pair. The ledger overflows whenever we try to count. Recommendation: treat duplication as **method**, not anomaly; teach clerks to expect seams.

**Disposition.** Filed; referred to Phase III committee.

### (b) Field Report — *Static at the Window* (Phase IV; Mediation & Aperture → Capital)

**Abstract.** Two static incidents at the South Arcade window during festival intake; lacquer re-applied; grit logged as part of the slip, not noise.

**Clip (A1):**
`|| Face-window shall be circular… No door; no walk-in ingress… Two instances of grit-induced feed distortion (“static”)… Status: PASS. ||`&#x20;

**Commentary.** The window is a theory of what may cross. When the world leaves residue on our ledgers, we file the residue too.

**Disposition.** Adopted; schedule pre-festival re-check.

## 10) How to build your own canon as you go

Keep a private **Index of Exhibits** (slips you know you can quote quickly):

* **B2** — “Two kinds of story about Dens.” (Boundary)&#x20;
* **C1** — West-ditch meter series. (Boundary)&#x20;
* **D2** — Roads & doubles minutes. (Doubling)&#x20;
* **D1** — Castelia silhouettes: mismatched details. (Doubling)&#x20;
* **A1 / A2** — Window & stairs doctrine. (Mediation & Aperture) &#x20;
* **E1** — Murder songs first lines. (Violence & Secret Life)&#x20;
* **F1** — Counting-five cases w/ cart. (Mediation & Aperture + Violence)&#x20;
* **H1 / I2 / H2** — Tower catechism; connotation drift; Sticks quiet-hours. (Silence & Withdrawal)  &#x20;

Use them to triangulate new arguments and to **cross-index**: every debate doc should point at least to two of these and to one doc in another Phase (to keep the “history spine” alive).&#x20;

---

## 11) Minimal ethics of keeping (your stance as a character)

* **Do not launder** contradictions into harmonies. Dens is both town and wilderness; let it remain so **on the page**.&#x20;
* **Do not erase** residues (grit, hum, burr). They are part of the message, not noise. &#x20;
* **Do not patronize** practices of silence. File their **methods**: loops, hands, drills. &#x20;
* **Do not worship** “firsts.” Originals are often seams. Count proliferations, not beginnings. &#x20;

---

## 12) A 30-day temperament-balanced expansion arc

Balance phases AND temperaments across the month:

**Week 1 (Phase I — Clerkly dominance):**
- Day 1: Clerkly minute establishing provenance protocols
- Day 2: Philosophical memo proposing borough drawers (early systematizing)
- Day 3: Clerkly circular on slip custody procedures  
- Day 4: Clerkly field report on filing contradictions
- Day 5: Philosophical counter-memo challenging pure regionalism

**Week 2 (Phase II — All three emerge):**  
- Day 6: Clerkly field report on Dens boundary data
- Day 7: Romantic colloquy note on withdrawal practices
- Day 8: Philosophical case note proposing Doubling Order
- Day 9: Clerkly memo resisting new categories
- Day 10: Romantic narrative about pickbox cart testimonies

**Week 3 (Phase III — Philosophical dominance):**
- Day 11: Philosophical memorandum codifying six Orders
- Day 12: Clerkly counter-memo warning against overreach  
- Day 13: Philosophical brief on cross-indexing standards
- Day 14: Clerkly minute documenting implementation problems
- Day 15: Philosophical ruling on edge cases

**Week 4 (Phase IV — Three-way collision):**
- Day 16: Philosophical directive on Orders-first filing
- Day 17: Clerkly objection to mandatory cross-indexing
- Day 18: Romantic hearing transcript with witness voices
- Day 19: Philosophical response systematizing the hearing
- Day 20: Clerkly procedural complaint about romantic dramatization

**Continue this pattern**: each week should include voices from all three temperaments, with the balance shifting to reflect the historical phases.

## 13) The Three Temperaments: Deep Characterization Guide

### Clerkly Archivists (The Custodians)

**Core fear**: Chaos, loss, falsification. The slips will be misfiled, lost, or corrupted.

**Core conviction**: "The Archive preserves; it does not interpret." Custody is sacred duty.

**Voice markers**: 
- Short, precise sentences. "Filed under Dens. Contradiction noted."
- Repetitive administrative language. "As per Protocol 7.3..."
- Distrust of speculation. "The slip contains no evidence of..."
- Focus on procedures, stamps, cross-references, filing codes.

**Relationship to evidence**: Mechanical preservation. Every contradiction must be filed, not resolved.

**Relationship to story**: Suspicious. Stories obscure facts, create false patterns.

**Relationship to categories**: Resistant to new ones, but will adopt them if they improve filing accuracy.

### Romantic Archivists (The Witnesses) 

**Core fear**: Fragmentation, silence, meaninglessness. The slips will scatter into noise.

**Core conviction**: "Every slip carries a witness; every witness carries a world." Testimony must cohere into story.

**Voice markers**:
- Narrative momentum. "She brought the news that autumn, when the carts returned..."
- Dramatic attention to individual voices. "The clerk wept as she filed the contradiction."
- Questions that open rather than close. "But what if the ditch speaks?"
- Focus on human experience, individual testimony, emotional resonance.

**Relationship to evidence**: Testimonial weaving. Contradictions are dramatic tension, not filing problems.

**Relationship to story**: Essential. Slips without story are noise.

**Relationship to categories**: Useful if they help stories cohere; dangerous if they scatter witnesses.

### Philosophical Archivists (The Systematizers)

**Core fear**: Incoherence, arbitrariness, chaos. The Archive will become mere accumulation without understanding.

**Core conviction**: "The Archive reveals the world's orders." Categories mirror metaphysical structure.

**Voice markers**:
- Abstract language. "The Boundary Order manifests as unstable geographical determination..."
- Systematic ambition. "Six Orders, each with sub-categories, cross-indexed by..."
- Confident legislation. "Henceforth, all slips shall be filed under..."
- Focus on patterns, structures, underlying principles.

**Relationship to evidence**: Systematic organization. Contradictions are dialectical pressure revealing deeper truths.

**Relationship to story**: Useful if systematic; dangerous if merely personal or local.

**Relationship to categories**: Essential. Categories are discovery methods, not arbitrary impositions.

---

## 14) Temperamental Balance Requirements

**The Archive survives because no temperament triumphs entirely.** Your expansion must maintain this tension:

- **Without clerks**: The Archive dissolves into speculation and storytelling.
- **Without romantics**: The Archive becomes mechanical, losing human witness.  
- **Without philosophers**: The Archive remains fragmented accumulation without insight.

**Each document should embody one temperament clearly** while acknowledging the others exist. The debate is their ongoing quarrel.

**Phase balance**:
- Phase I: Clerkly dominance, but philosophical seeds appear
- Phase II: All three emerge, romantic voices find space  
- Phase III: Philosophical dominance, clerkly resistance
- Phase IV: Three-way collision generates institutional self-consciousness

---

## 15) Final encouragement: The quarrel continues

Write as if your words will be stamped, docketed, and shelved—and yet might still change how clerks in the Capital handle a slip, how a singer in North Town picks a line, how a Sticks clinic schedules quiet hours. That is the tension this project lives on: **mirror vs maker**; **provenance vs order**; **window vs door**.

But now add this: **clerkly vs romantic vs philosophical**. The Archive is not one voice but three, locked in permanent productive tension.

When in doubt, return to a **clip** and let it teach you the right voice for the day. But remember: the same clip will speak differently through different temperaments.

> "We note the contaminations because they are the cost of testimony."&#x20;

That's the archivist's creed—but each temperament bears the cost differently.
