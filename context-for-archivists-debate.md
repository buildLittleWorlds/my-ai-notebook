Here’s a field guide you can hand to the graduate student—dense on context, rich with examples, and designed to keep them “in character” as a Capital archivist writing into the debate. It distills what the archive is, what Densworld seems to be doing, why the archivists are arguing, and how to produce daily documents that both advance the world and feel internally authentic.

# The Archive, the Capital, and the Debate: A Working Guide for the Next Archivist

## 0) What this job is (and isn’t)

Your assignment is to speak from inside the Capital archive. You are an archivist—sometimes junior, sometimes senior; sometimes dissenting, sometimes orthodox—who files slips, argues policy, and slowly realizes that classification is not just housekeeping but a theory of the world.

The core question you inherit is simple to say and difficult to live with:

> Does the archive mirror the world’s structure, or does the archive’s language help shape it?&#x20;

Everything below gives you a thick sense of the world (“Densworld”), the archive that tries to keep it, and the factions arguing over how that keeping should work.

---

## 1) The world as the archive encounters it (Densworld in brief)

Think of Densworld not as a map, but as a set of **recurring pressures** the slips keep bringing back to your desk. The archive’s current best attempt to model those pressures is the system of **Orders**—six metaphysical classes used to file evidence by what reality it performs rather than where it was found:

* **Boundary** — unstable edges; town/wilderness; lines that move.&#x20;
* **Doubling** — replication; journeys spawning journeys; originals-without-origin.&#x20;
* **Craving** — desire as generative force; appetites that make artifacts.&#x20;
* **Silence & Withdrawal** — renunciation; non-speech methods; ritual cadence.&#x20;
* **Violence & Secret Life** — parallel ledgers of harm; murder songs; numerologies.&#x20;
* **Mediation & Aperture** — windows, devices, carts; constraints on access and authorship.&#x20;

These Orders **supersede Region** as the primary way to shelve evidence; Region is now secondary provenance. That policy shift is the heart of the debate you’ll be writing into.&#x20;

### Regional textures (provenance drawer, not destiny)

* **Dens / Densmok** — a town that is also a wilderness; testimonies and meter logs track each other as the edge moves. &#x20;
* **Yeller Quarry** — journeys that throw more journeys; a culture of copies and proliferations (roads, silhouettes). &#x20;
* **North / Northo** — murder songs and secret ledgers; also the mapmaker’s cart that opens inward.&#x20;
* **Capital / Capeast** — the bureaucratic heart; access engineered by windows, stairs, and rules; festivals as after-ledgers.&#x20;
* **Tower / Sticks** — catechisms that make speech lay tracks for the hand; withdrawals that put hands before words. &#x20;
* **Dead River** — a counting mania that seeks “five,” shadowed by the cart and by alley-market silhouettes.&#x20;

## 2) The Capital and its method (why the window matters)

The Capital does not just file paper; it **architects access**. The canonical emblem is the **round window**: an aperture “not to exceed one-third cranial width,” through which *slips* may pass, but not bodies. The inspection log reads like scripture for mediation: lacquers, tolerances, static incidents, pass/fail.&#x20;

The commentary makes the doctrine plain: “This window is not a door. The rule is design: knowledge may pass; bodies may not.” Filing under **Mediation & Aperture** is not aesthetic; it’s the city’s theory of truth.&#x20;

Even staircases are policy—“designed to slow crowds while favoring licensed knees.” In Capital, the building *is* the filter.&#x20;

**Takeaway for your voice:** When you write as a Capital archivist, be exact, procedural, and attentive to devices: windows, carts, rigs, ledgers. Describe how form constrains access—that’s the Capital’s way of thinking.

---

## 3) The debate you’re joining (its phases and stakes)

The archivists have formalized their quarrel as a four-phase institutional history:

* **Phase I — Regional Drawers:** everything filed by geography, “Provenance First.”&#x20;
* **Phase II — Faults in Geography:** evidence begins to leak across the drawers (moving edges, originals that won’t resolve, authorless devices).&#x20;
* **Phase III — Orders Proposal:** Varro’s memorandum introduces the six Orders and argues Orders-first filing. Kettel counters that metaphysical labels risk *making* cases.&#x20;
* **Phase IV — Implementation & Objections:** a directive adopts Orders-first with cross-indexing; hearings probe whether catalog language feeds back into practice.&#x20;

A succinct planning brief codifies how this hub “does history,” what each phase should link to, and the editorial standards for debate docs (Orders-first → Form → Region; clips as evidence; contradictions preserved). Use it as your procedural compass.  &#x20;

---

## 4) The Orders as working lenses (with canonical anchors)

Each Order below includes 1) what it catches, 2) emblematic exhibits, and 3) a question you can push in daily writing.

### A. Boundary

* **What it catches:** edges that won’t hold; measurements and stories that move each other.
* **Exhibits:** Dens testimonies (“two kinds of story”) and the west-ditch meter series (Years 17–19) that rises and falls with those testimonies. &#x20;
* **Your question:** When measurement follows speech, is the border a place—or a grammar?

### B. Doubling

* **What it catches:** proliferations; copies without origin; roads that bud inside other roads.
* **Exhibits:** Quarry colloquy minutes on roads (“each path throws another”), and Castelia’s “fivefold” hunt silhouettes whose details don’t align across impressions. &#x20;
* **Your question:** If originals won’t resolve, what does “authenticity” even measure?

### C. Craving

* **What it catches:** desire that makes artifacts—rigs, songs, crowds.
* **Exhibits:** Densmok’s coder-singers and mind-node rigs (catalogs of humming, pairing, afterimages); Capeast festival aftermath where appetite and rumor reorganize a square.&#x20;
* **Your question:** When appetite leaves artifacts, should we file the artifact—or the appetite?

### D. Silence & Withdrawal

* **What it catches:** practices that put hands before words; repetition that builds fit.
* **Exhibits:** Tower catechism: “edges to edges” drills that turn into habit speech; Sticks withdrawal logs where quiet-hours re-mark the local grammar of action. &#x20;
* **Your question:** If silence is a method, can the archive quote it without breaking it?

### E. Violence & Secret Life

* **What it catches:** parallel ledgers of harm; the public melody with a private confession under it.
* **Exhibits:** North murder songs index (first lines, doubled voices, marginal notes about a “missionary” killer).&#x20;
* **Your question:** What counts as confession when the melody is communal?

### F. Mediation & Aperture

* **What it catches:** how devices, windows, carts, and paperwork constrain access and authorship.
* **Exhibits:** Capital window inspections (“no door; slips only”); the mapmaker’s pickbox cart that “opens inward,” pulling its own world; counting-five cases where the market’s silhouette and the road’s rumor braid into one dossier. &#x20;
* **Your question:** When form is already theory, can we pretend the catalog is neutral?

---

## 5) The slip as your unit of truth (and how to cite)

Every piece of evidence you use should be treated as a **clip**—verbatim or near-verbatim excerpt—wrapped in protocol, then indexed. The standing **“How to Cite a Clip”** procedure (Protocol 7.3) standardizes this for all archivists:

* Identify **Slip Code**; note **Provenance** (Region + Form); quote with `||` or blockquote; assign **Order(s)**; add a short **Commentary** line explaining how the clip pressures the filing choice. &#x20;

**Practice rule:** **Contradictions are evidence**. Don’t reconcile mismatched witness cards; don’t collapse parallel testimonies. File both; say why both matter.&#x20;

---

## 6) The kinds of documents you should produce (daily)

Write one document per day, **in character**. Vary voice and rank (junior clerk, field officer, registrar, dissenter). Keep them short (400–900 words) and **administrative in tone**—your unease leaks through what you file, not purple prose. The debate hub’s plan lists the main genres and the Phase they tend to belong to: memos, minutes, field reports, colloquy notes, directives, hearings, rulings, briefs. &#x20;

**All debate docs should:**

* Lead with **Phase**, **Doc Type**, **Order Focus**, **Region(s)**, **Date & Clerk**.
* Include **≥1 clip** (use Protocol 7.3).
* End with **Disposition** (Adopted / Filed / Referred / Superseded).
* Cross-reference **≥2 slips** and **≥1 doc in a different Phase** whenever possible.&#x20;

### A non-exhaustive menu of document types & angles

* **Memo (Phase I / III):** policy, taxonomy, re-shelving rationale.
* **Minute (Phase I):** a meeting transcript, cool and procedural.
* **Field Report (Phase II):** meters vs mouths; device vs witness.
* **Colloquy Note (Phase II):** scholars arguing; the minutes wobble between theory and death notice (Quarry style).&#x20;
* **Counter-Memo (Phase III):** warn that labels teach witnesses how to speak.&#x20;
* **Directive / Ruling (Phase IV):** announce Orders-first; settle edge cases (e.g., window & stairs throttle). &#x20;
* **Hearing (Phase IV):** take testimony from Sticks clinics or North singers on how catalog terms travel back into practice.&#x20;

---

## 7) Canonical motifs you should keep returning to

These are “world-engines”—repeat them, rotate them, cross-index them. Each has at least one anchor slip you can quote.

* **Two kinds of Dens** (town vs wilderness). The edge moves when the story moves. &#x20;
* **The window** (no door). Access engineered; paper passes; bodies do not.&#x20;
* **Roads that bud** in the Quarry. Proliferation over origin.&#x20;
* **Fivefold silhouettes** (Castelia). Copies with mismatched wrists and jawlines.&#x20;
* **The pickbox cart** that opens inward. Authorless burden; house in a wheelbarrow logic.&#x20;
* **Murder songs** and the missionary. Public melody, private ledger.&#x20;
* **Edges to edges** (Tower catechism). Speech lays the track for the hand; habit spills into meaning. &#x20;
* **Withdrawal logs** (Sticks). Quiet hours reset grammar; hands first, words last.&#x20;

---

## 8) Daily practice: prompts, stances, and constraints

### A. Rotating stances (pick one per day)

* **Varroist (pro-Orders):** Argue that filing by recurrence makes the world legible.
* **Regionalist (old school):** Defend provenance as least-falsifiable anchor.
* **Constructivist (skeptical):** Warn that Orders teach witnesses what to say.&#x20;

### B. Prompts (aim for 30+ days)

* **Boundary:** A porchline vanishes overnight; log meters and proverbs side-by-side.&#x20;
* **Doubling:** Audit second-generation road maps; what counts as the “main line”?&#x20;
* **Craving:** Catalog a new Densmok rig; record its side-effects as method, not bug. (Use Protocol 7.3.)&#x20;
* **Silence & Withdrawal:** Observe a quiet-hours loop in the Sticks; does surveillance alter tempo?&#x20;
* **Violence & Secret Life:** Index five first lines from murder songs; attach marginalia on who smiles where.&#x20;
* **Mediation & Aperture:** Inspect the window before festival week; note lacquer, fissures, “static.”&#x20;

### C. Constraints to obey every time

* Use **at least one clip** with the **Protocol 7.3** formatting.&#x20;
* Assign **1–3 Orders** (primary) and **Region(s)** (secondary).&#x20;
* **Contradictions ≠ errors**; log and cross-index them.&#x20;
* End with a **Disposition** (Adopted / Filed / Referred / Superseded).&#x20;

## 9) Micro-models (two short “in character” pieces to imitate)

### (a) Colloquy Note — *On the Overflowing Ledger* (Phase II; Doubling → Quarry)

**Abstract.** The minutes record that our maps double faster than we can declare an origin. We propose shelving under **Doubling** with Region as provenance.

**Clip (D2):**
`|| But midway a second road buds off inside the first… The maps cannot agree which is the copy and which is the line. Each path throws another. ||`&#x20;

**Commentary.** “Origin/fork” is a sentimental verb pair. The ledger overflows whenever we try to count. Recommendation: treat duplication as **method**, not anomaly; teach clerks to expect seams.

**Disposition.** Filed; referred to Phase III committee.

### (b) Field Report — *Static at the Window* (Phase IV; Mediation & Aperture → Capital)

**Abstract.** Two static incidents at the South Arcade window during festival intake; lacquer re-applied; grit logged as part of the slip, not noise.

**Clip (A1):**
`|| Face-window shall be circular… No door; no walk-in ingress… Two instances of grit-induced feed distortion (“static”)… Status: PASS. ||`&#x20;

**Commentary.** The window is a theory of what may cross. When the world leaves residue on our ledgers, we file the residue too.

**Disposition.** Adopted; schedule pre-festival re-check.

## 10) How to build your own canon as you go

Keep a private **Index of Exhibits** (slips you know you can quote quickly):

* **B2** — “Two kinds of story about Dens.” (Boundary)&#x20;
* **C1** — West-ditch meter series. (Boundary)&#x20;
* **D2** — Roads & doubles minutes. (Doubling)&#x20;
* **D1** — Castelia silhouettes: mismatched details. (Doubling)&#x20;
* **A1 / A2** — Window & stairs doctrine. (Mediation & Aperture) &#x20;
* **E1** — Murder songs first lines. (Violence & Secret Life)&#x20;
* **F1** — Counting-five cases w/ cart. (Mediation & Aperture + Violence)&#x20;
* **H1 / I2 / H2** — Tower catechism; connotation drift; Sticks quiet-hours. (Silence & Withdrawal)  &#x20;

Use them to triangulate new arguments and to **cross-index**: every debate doc should point at least to two of these and to one doc in another Phase (to keep the “history spine” alive).&#x20;

---

## 11) Minimal ethics of keeping (your stance as a character)

* **Do not launder** contradictions into harmonies. Dens is both town and wilderness; let it remain so **on the page**.&#x20;
* **Do not erase** residues (grit, hum, burr). They are part of the message, not noise. &#x20;
* **Do not patronize** practices of silence. File their **methods**: loops, hands, drills. &#x20;
* **Do not worship** “firsts.” Originals are often seams. Count proliferations, not beginnings. &#x20;

---

## 12) A 30-day arc you can follow (suggested)

* **Week 1 (Phase I)** — write the old order from the inside: three memos and two minutes making the case for geography, custody, and seals. (Quote A1/A2 as triumphs of order.)&#x20;
* **Week 2 (Phase II)** — break it open: four field/colloquy notes on Dens edge data, Quarry roads, Castelia burrs, and the cart.   &#x20;
* **Week 3 (Phase III)** — take a side: Varro’s manifesto, Kettel’s counter, and a cross-index brief with worked examples (A1, D2, E2).&#x20;
* **Week 4 (Phase IV)** — make it law, then doubt it: a directive; a hearing from Sticks & North; and an edge-case ruling on the window/stairs. &#x20;

---

## 13) Final encouragement

Write as if your words will be stamped, docketed, and shelved—and yet might still change how clerks in the Capital handle a slip, how a singer in North Town picks a line, how a Sticks clinic schedules quiet hours. That is the tension this project lives on: **mirror vs maker**; **provenance vs order**; **window vs door**.

When in doubt, return to a **clip** and let it teach you the right voice for the day.

> “We note the contaminations because they are the cost of testimony.”&#x20;

That’s the archivist’s creed in one line.
