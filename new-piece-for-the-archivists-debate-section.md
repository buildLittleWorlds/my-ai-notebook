Here’s a sample daily entry I’d write “in character” as a Capital archivist, drawing directly on the Densworld materials and filing it as part of the Archivists’ Debate.

# Phase IV — Hearing Minutes: “Does the Catalog Create the Case?”

**Phase:** IV (Implementation & Objections)
**Doc Type:** Hearing (record of testimony)
**Order Focus:** Mediation & Aperture; Silence & Withdrawal; Violence & Secret Life
**Region(s):** Capital (South Arcade); North Town; Sticks
**Date & Clerk:** Year 23, Q3 — Clerk ML
**Status:** Adopted for Record

## Abstract

We convened to examine whether the Archive’s language—particularly the Orders—feeds back into practice, teaching witnesses and clerks to perceive in its terms. Evidence was taken from a North singer (song index E1), a Sticks clinician (withdrawal logs I1), and a Capital inspector (window log A1). Committee notes follow.

## Witnesses & Exhibits

### W–01 (North Town singer; stool transcript, mile 11)

**Clip (E1):**
|| *Bring me the knife with the churchyard handle* ||
**Provenance:** North Town · Song Index (first lines; field recordings)
**Order(s):** Violence & Secret Life
**Commentary:** Public melody with an embedded instrument (“churchyard handle”) that gestures toward a private ledger.

**Testimony (summary):** Singer reports that recent collectors “ask for the *Order* of the song before the song itself,” marking verses as “Violence” or “Secret Life.” He admits to emphasizing the “handle” after hearing it named in a clerk’s note. “You asked for the hidden ledger; I sang the ledger,” he said.

### W–02 (Sticks clinician; clinic intake cards)

**Clip (I1):**
|| A place like America not too long ago… but also a thousand years in the future… In the Sticks people disengage from screens and reenter the physical world. ||
**Provenance:** Mirado Sticks · Withdrawal Logs (return-to-body reports)
**Order(s):** Silence & Withdrawal
**Commentary:** Silence described as method (hand-work, loops) rather than absence.

**Testimony (summary):** Clinician reports an uptick in patients describing their own practice as “withdrawal” *after* the Archive circulated training materials to local clinics. “They begin to time their loops by the phrases we use,” she said. A case labeled MS–11 now quotes our phrasing back at intake (“non-speech mornings”), a detail not present in earlier logs.

### W–03 (South Arcade inspector; aperture compliance)

**Clip (A1):**
|| Face-window shall be circular; no door; slips only. Two instances of grit-induced feed distortion (“static”) during receipt of Quarry hunt sketches… Status: PASS. ||
**Provenance:** Capital · Inspection Log (caliper checks; incident notes)
**Order(s):** Mediation & Aperture
**Commentary:** Access is designed; residue (static, grit) is filed as part of the slip, not noise.

**Testimony (summary):** Inspector confirms that, since adoption of Orders-first filing, juniors “notice” static more readily and “log it as Mediation” where prior practice would have brushed residue off ledger edges. “The frame teaches the eye,” he conceded, but insists this yields better custody, not distortion.

## Committee Discussion

1. **On Instruction as Metronome (W–02):**
   The committee notes a shift from *describing* quiet practices to *reciting* them: the repetition “edges to edges” already shows how speech can lay the track for the hand; our labels may be laying new tracks for field behavior. The Chair cautions that standardizing the phrase “non-speech mornings” risks producing a cadence where we intended only to describe one.

2. **On Melody and Ledger (W–01):**
   Songs have always kept a parallel ledger; the novelty is that the singer now names the ledger *for us* (“you asked for the hidden ledger; I sang the ledger”). This is not forgery. It is a collaboration the committee must file honestly: some confessions are catalyzed by the presence of an index.

3. **On Residue as Evidence (W–03):**
   The window’s doctrine—“this is not a door”—pre-dates the Orders, but the category of **Mediation & Aperture** has taught clerks to preserve grit. We accept this as a gain: better to over-keep residue (and risk a metaphysical gloss) than to wipe away a detail that belongs to the world.

---

## Findings

* **F1 (Feedback is real):** The Orders have begun to travel back into practice. Language appears in witness mouths and on clinic cards after our circulars and training notes are distributed.

* **F2 (Feedback is not necessarily falsification):** Where recurrence is a property of the world (e.g., withdrawal loops; doubled voices), our terms may function as *names for structure*, not scripts for fraud.

* **F3 (Custody vs. Category):** The Capital’s physical constraints (aperture; stair throttle) already shape behavior. Metaphysical vocabulary adds a second layer; both must be audited.

---

## Recommendations

* **R1 — Cross-Index Trigger:** For any testimony that cites an Order by name, add a mandatory cross-index to a Phase IV doc (“Feedback Docket”). This keeps a ledger of where our language appears in the field.

* **R2 — Orthography Discipline:** Where possible, preserve witness phrasing in quotation bars and keep archivist paraphrase in commentary lines. (Protocol 7.3). This maintains a breathing-space between *clip* and *clerk*.

* **R3 — Local Lexicon Addendum:** In Sticks and North filing, append a local-lexicon note when an Order term is congruent with indigenous phrasing (e.g., “quiet hours,” “second road”) to avoid overwriting native names.

---

## Disposition

**Adopted (5–2).**
The “Feedback Docket” is established under Phase IV. Clerks to annotate any Order-named testimony with a cross-index tag: `FD-Y23Q3-[seq]`. Training materials to include a cautionary paragraph on phrase seeding.

## Cross-References

* **E1 — North Town: Murder Songs Index (first lines & field recordings)** — witness W–01’s domain; doubled voices and knife/handle motif (Order: Violence & Secret Life).
* **I1 — Mirado Sticks: Withdrawal Logs** — clinician W–02’s cases; loops, hand-work, silence as method (Order: Silence & Withdrawal).
* **A1 — Capital: Window Aperture (caliper check log)** — inspector W–03’s notes; static as part of the slip (Order: Mediation & Aperture).
* **Phase II — Colloquy: Fivefold Silhouettes** — prior instance of catalog terms influencing trade talk (“original,” “burr”) in alley copies (Order: Doubling).

### Clerk’s Margin (sealed)

It seems less that we create the case and more that we **give it a handle**. The song already had a knife; we labeled the handle “churchyard.” The quiet already had a loop; we called it “non-speech.” The window already kept bodies out; we named the keeping **Mediation**. The work then is not to unname—but to record where our naming starts to sing back.
