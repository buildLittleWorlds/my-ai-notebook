## About the Romantic Quick Kit

The concepts in this kit are interconnected, built around a central story that many Romantic writers and thinkers shared: a journey that begins in a state of primal unity, falls into a painful state of division and alienation, and concludes by returning home to a higher, more self-aware state of integration.

Think of it as a great circle or spiral. The pages below explore the key features of this journey.
